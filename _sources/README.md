# USHMM Library

For this project, we built a custom Python package called `ushmm` which allows one to download data from the USHMM. It is an unofficial API for their Collections Search. This package also has basic functions for processing the PDFs. It is used primarily for the notebook 01-pdf-to-html.ipynb.
