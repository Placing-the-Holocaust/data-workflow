    "One of the key advantages of our dataset is that the speakers of the testimonies are isolated. This means that we can identify specific sections of dialogue that are questions and investigate the types of questions that are posed, the lengths of those questions, and the frequency of questions across testimonies. This can tell us a lot about how testimonies differ in their structure.\n",

    " - `datasets`: for loading our dataset from Hugging Face\n",
    " - `BeautifulSoup`: for parsing HTML content and extracting questions\n",
    " - `matplotlib`: for creating basic visualizations\n",
    " - `sentence_transformers`: for encoding questions into embeddings\n",
    " - `umap`: for dimensionality reduction of embeddings\n",
    " - `plotly`: for creating interactive visualizations\n",
    " - `pandas`: for data manipulation and analysis\n",

    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With these vectors created, we can now perform dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. This process is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, such as the vector representations of our questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why dimensionality reduction is beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visualization: It allows us to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space, making it easier to identify patterns and clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computational Efficiency: Reducing the number of dimensions can significantly speed up machine learning algorithms and reduce memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Noise Reduction: It can help in removing noise from the data by focusing on the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality: As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data needed to make statistically sound predictions grows exponentially. Dimensionality reduction helps mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we're using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction. UMAP is a powerful technique that can capture both local and global structure in the data, making it particularly effective for visualizing complex datasets like our question embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing our high-dimensional question embeddings to just two dimensions, we'll be able to create a scatter plot where each point represents a question. This visualization will allow us to see how questions relate to each other in semantic space, potentially revealing clusters of similar questions or other interesting patterns in the data.\n"
