# Semantic Search

Semantic search is an advanced information retrieval technique that aims to understand the intent and contextual meaning behind a user's search query, rather than just matching keywords. It's like having a smart assistant who understands what you're really looking for, even if you don't use the exact words.

## How it works

1. **Understanding meaning**: Semantic search uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to comprehend the meaning of words and phrases in context.
2. **Vector representations**: It converts both the search query and the documents in the database into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning.
3. **Similarity matching**: The system then finds documents whose vector representations are most similar to the query vector.

## Why it's useful

- **Better results**: It can find relevant information even when the exact keywords aren't present.
- **Handles ambiguity**: It can distinguish between different meanings of the same word based on context.
- **Understands synonyms and related concepts**: It can match content that uses different words to express the same idea.

## Comparison with BM25

BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a traditional keyword-based ranking function:

- **BM25**: 
  - Relies on keyword matching and frequency
  - Fast and computationally efficient
  - Struggles with synonyms and context
- **Semantic Search**:
  - Understands meaning and context
  - Can find relevant results without exact keyword matches
  - Generally more accurate for complex queries
  - More computationally intensive

## Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines the strengths of both semantic search and traditional keyword-based methods like BM25:

1. It uses both techniques to retrieve and rank results.
2. This approach can provide the speed and precision of keyword matching along with the contextual understanding of semantic search.
3. It's often more robust and can handle a wider range of query types effectively.

By leveraging the strengths of both methods, hybrid search aims to provide the best possible search experience, balancing accuracy, relevance, and performance.
