# About the Project

## Background

The Holocaust, one of the most horrific genocides in human history, continues to be a subject of intense study and research. As our understanding of this tragic event evolves, new approaches and technologies are being employed to uncover fresh insights and perspectives. One such innovative approach is the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and spatial studies to Holocaust research.

## Anne Knowles and Her Work

At the forefront of this groundbreaking research is [Anne Kelly Knowles](https://umaine.edu/history/people/dr-anne-kelly-knowles/), the McBride Professor of History at the University of Maine. Professor Knowles, who describes herself as a historical geographer, has dedicated the past 16 years to revealing the geographies of the Holocaust. Her work focuses on mapping Holocaust sites and understanding how the nature of places influenced victims' experiences.

Professor Knowles's background in historical geography brings a unique perspective to Holocaust studies. Historical geography examines how people perceive and shape human and physical environments over time, using archival research to discover how places differ and change. This approach is inherently interdisciplinary and brings academic studies "down to ground," making history more tangible by examining where events took place and how specific conditions affected people's lives.

## The Holocaust Geographies Collaborative

In 2008, Professor Knowles and her colleagues began a collaborative effort known as the Holocaust Geographies Collaborative. This initiative, initially funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to apply historical GIS to Holocaust studies. This marked a significant shift in Knowles's research approach, moving from solo archival scholarship to collaborative, technology-driven research.

## Placing the Holocaust Project

The current project, Placing the Holocaust, is the latest in a series of digital humanities initiatives led by Professor Knowles. Funded by the [National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities (ODH)](https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=HAA-287827-22), this project aims to create a public website that integrates two key approaches to studying the Holocaust:

1. Mapping the traits of camps and ghettos
2. Developing a search tool to identify and contextualize various types of places mentioned in Holocaust survivor testimonies

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the "Placing the Holocaust" project include:

1. Developing a searchable database of nearly one thousand Holocaust survivor testimonies, focusing on the spatial aspects of their experiences.
2. Connecting these experiences to a comprehensive GIS database of over 2,200 camps and ghettos, including detailed information on their characteristics and operations.
3. Bridging the gap between perpetrator and victim narratives, which have often been studied separately due to differences in available sources.
4. Providing a new research and learning platform for scholars, educators, students, and the general public to explore the spatial dimensions of the Holocaust.

## Project Outputs

The main output of this project will be a public website that offers:

1. Interactive maps displaying the locations and characteristics of camps and ghettos.
2. A search tool for exploring survivor testimonies with a focus on place-based experiences.
3. The ability to link GIS data directly to oral histories, a pioneering feature in digital humanities projects.
4. Downloadable data, transcripts, and user-generated maps to facilitate further research and education.

## Historical Significance

This project represents a significant advancement in Holocaust studies by:

1. Applying cutting-edge digital technologies to historical research.
2. Emphasizing the crucial role of geography in shaping individual experiences during the Holocaust.
3. Providing a more integrated view of the Holocaust by connecting perpetrator actions with victim experiences through a spatial lens.
4. Offering new tools for researchers, educators, and students to explore and understand the complex geographies of the Holocaust.

By leveraging GIS technology and spatial analysis, the "Placing the Holocaust" project aims to bring new understanding to this critical period in history, highlighting the profound impact of place on the experiences of Holocaust victims and the implementation of Nazi policies.
