      "226. Q: Not so.\n",
      "227. Q: Right. So you go into one part of Auschwitz one, there's barracks one through 11, I think, and they -- there is a -- a wall around it?\n",
      "228. Q: In Auschwitz one, that they built because they knew the women were coming.\n",
      "229. Q: So it's a very brutal experience, I imagine, so different from anything that you've ever experienced or imagined in your life.\n",

      "240. Q: The water?\n",
      "241. Q: So was everybody so red and bleeding as -- as you?\n",
      "242. Q: She was --\n",
      "243. Q: Did you begin to get angry as well as depressed?\n",

      "286. Q: That's it.\n",
      "287. Q: So you had a certain kind of calm about you in a -- in a way?\n",
      "288. Q: That this was what the world was, and this is how you were going to do that.\n",
      "289. Q: Yes.\n",
      "290. Q: Okay, let's --\n",
      "291. Q: Very scary.\n",

      "293. Q: Yeah?\n",
      "294. Q: It was better not to see yourself, do you think?\n",
      "295. Q: But you were wearing cl -- those wooden clogs?\n",
      "296. Q: So did you turn away fast?\n",
      "297. Q: You stopped to be yourself?\n",
      "298. Q: So you -- once you saw yourself, that -- that hurt you for the next few days? It was difficult for you?\n",
      "299. Q: No more.\n",
      "300. Q: Right.\n",
      "301. Q: So everything was transformed?\n",
      "302. Q: Including your insides?\n",

      "304. Q: So if you knew somebody, you were able to have communication, and if you didn't --\n",
      "305. Q: -- know them, you didn't -- you didn't bother.\n",
      "306. Q: Nothing.\n",

      "333. Q: Really?\n",
      "334. Q: And you were inside when you did that.\n",
      "335. Q: Let me just ask you something. Whose clothes were you washing, do you know?\n",
      "336. Q: Really?\n",
      "337. Q: Right.\n",
      "338. Q: Now, were you able to wash yourself, because there was one -- running water in the barrack at Auschwitz one?\n",
      "339. Q: So you had a certain kind of hygiene that you could --\n",
      "340. Q: That's -- yeah -- yes.\n",
      "341. Q: And then it changes quite radically.\n",
      "342. Q: Yes. And the sewing room, what are you sewing?\n",
      "343. Q: Repairing.\n",
      "344. Q: And repairing uniforms or clothes that people -- the haftling are wearing?\n",
      "345. Q: Stripes, yes.\n",
      "346. Q: So that's what you were repairing?\n",
      "347. Q: Now, when you go --\n",
      "348. Q: Yes.\n",
      "349. Q: Right. Male and female, or just female do you think?\n",
      "350. Q: You don't know.\n",
      "351. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "352. Q: So then you're put on this demolition crew, and I gather that's where you meet Helen Teshauer, Tsipi. Or not --\n",
      "353. Q: Not on demolition --\n",
      "354. Q: -- you -- you [indecipherable]\n",
      "355. Q: -- in the field you met her?\n",
      "356. Q: And why did you like her approach, what was it about her that you remember?\n",
      "357. Q: Logic.\n",
      "358. Q: So would you say that you both had a kind of practical approach --\n",
      "359. Q: -- to what you were in?\n",
      "360. Q: So she was short, and a little stocky, is that what you said, a little --\n",
      "361. Q: [indecipherable]\n",
      "362. Q: A little short.\n",
      "363. Q: Now, did you meet her after you were doing the demolition? This is before Birkenau.\n",
      "364. Q: No\n",
      "365. Q: Cause you did demolition after the sewing room.\n",
      "366. Q: Afterwards.\n",
      "367. Q: Was -- given your description of yourself, that you were small and you weren't so strong, was demolition difficult for you?\n",
      "368. Q: A scarf?\n",
      "369. Q: This was the --\n",
      "370. Q: -- the -- the instrument that you used was like a long log with -- with iron-like -- something to hold onto on the sides, right?\n",

      "372. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "373. Q: I see, it was already, I see.\n",
      "374. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "375. Q: And so you did that for what, a couple of months?\n",
      "376. Q: It wasn't --\n",
      "377. Q: Gum plants?\n",
      "378. Q: For rubber?\n",
      "379. Q: Rubber.\n",
      "380. Q: Did that make -- did that help your body, did you get stronger, or did it make you weaker?\n",
      "381. Q: You didn't.\n",
      "382. Q: The -- the Russian -- is those pajamas.\n",
      "383. Q: [indecipherable] military uniforms.\n",
      "384. Q: Right.\n",
      "385. Q: Warmer.\n",
      "386. Q: Did you have trouble with your feet because of the shoes rubbing on your feet? Did you get sores?\n",
      "387. Q: Oh, that's late.\n",
      "388. Q: But not -- not early?\n",
      "389. Q: You don't remember.\n",
      "390. Q: Yes, so we -- we'll stop the tape and you'll --\n",
      "391. Q: Yes?\n",
      "392. Q: That's later. Okay.\n",
      "393. Q: We were talking about the shoes.\n",
      "394. Q: And -- and the problem you might have had with your -- with your feet, and it was leading to another story, yes?\n",
      "395. Q: Yes, so tell me.\n",
      "396. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "397. Q: So you did take risks, didn't you?\n",
      "398. Q: Cause it was risky for you to move.\n",
      "399. Q: Where did that come from?\n",
      "400. Q: You don't know.\n",
      "401. Q: You don't know.\n",
      "402. Q: Did you see dead bodies in Auschwitz one?\n",
      "403. Q: Dead bodies.\n",

      "405. Q: So in Auschwitz one, there was a gas chamber, yes?\n",
      "406. Q: You didn't know.\n",
      "407. Q: So you didn't smell anything funny?\n",
      "408. Q: Nothing. And nobody's said anything to you?\n",
      "409. Q: Right.\n",
      "410. Q: Uh-huh, right [indecipherable]\n",
      "411. Q: Did you hear about shooting in -- in Auschwitz one, that there was a punishment block, that they were shooting, did you -- did you hear about that when you were there? No.\n",
      "412. Q: You hear -- you heard it.\n",
      "413. Q: I think. In Auschwitz one.\n",
      "414. Q: Yes.\n",
      "415. Q: And you were in 10.\n",
      "416. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "417. Q: So they -- they were being hung by their hands behind their back?\n",
      "418. Q: Yes.\n",
      "419. Q: Yeah, Alice, when you say silent shooting, what -- what do you mean? You mean that there was -- there was a silencer on the gun that -- or that you were so far away you could only hear it a little bit?\n",
      "420. Q: You weren't far.\n",
      "421. Q: Uh-huh. Which was close to that wall.\n",
      "422. Q: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "423. Q: Yeah, but what were you hearing, a pop? Just a --\n",
      "424. Q: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "425. Q: You -- you didn't help at all in building Birkenau. Some of the prisoners were doing that.\n",
      "426. Q: Mm.\n",
      "427. Q: Roads.\n",
      "428. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "429. Q: And that became Auschwitz-Birkenau?\n",
      "430. Q: You think so, but you you're -- but you're not sure.\n",
      "431. Q: Right.\n",
      "432. Q: Planing?\n",
      "433. Q: Making it smooth?\n",
      "434. Q: A wheelbarrow?\n",
      "435. Q: Mm-hm.\n",
      "436. Q: [indecipherable]. Right.\n",
      "437. Q: No, not in a situation where they treated you so bad.\n",
      "438. Q: No.\n",
      "439. Q: Were there lights in Auschwitz one? Was it -- were there actual lights there?\n",
      "440. Q: In -- in the barracks?\n",
      "441. Q: There were.\n",
      "442. Q: So when did you find out that you were all -- all the women were being -- I know me -- men were going into aush -- into Auschwitz-Birkenau, they were already there.\n",
      "443. Q: [indecipherable] and being --\n",
      "444. Q: They were there, yes.\n",
      "445. Q: So how -- you don't know.\n",
      "446. Q: So did they announce to you what -- get up we're going to ow -- Auschwitz-Birkenau? I mean ho-how -- how did that happen?\n",
      "447. Q: And you go.\n",
      "448. Q: Nothing to -- nothing to pack, easy, right.\n",
      "449. Q: The bowl.\n",
      "450. Q: Did you carry the bowl with you all the time?\n",
      "451. Q: Something.\n",
      "452. Q: And what was in it?\n",
      "453. Q: I see.\n",
      "454. Q: You weren't given a spoon, you were given the bowl.\n",
      "455. Q: So -- so your mental state becomes smaller and smaller?\n",
      "456. Q: So that you think about very few things.\n",
      "457. Q: If you picture the barrack and your bed in Auschwitz one, do you see the bowl there? Do you think that you left the bowl on the bed?\n",
      "458. Q: So do you remember entering Birkenau in August of \"43, do you remember --\n",
      "459. Q: -- that first day?\n",
      "460. Q: What -- what can you tell me about it? What was it like?\n",
      "461. Q: And it's three, three high, right?\n",
      "462. Q: And more than two people are sleeping on each bunk?\n",
      "463. Q: In a lot of pain?\n",
      "464. Q: But it's interesting, because as bad as Auschwitz one was, Birkenau was much worse.\n",
      "465. Q: Yes.\n",
      "466. Q: It was easier than in Birkenau.\n",
      "467. Q: So Birkenau becomes a shock. There is no running water, right?\n",
      "468. Q: Right. It's a -- a room with just lots of holes in it, right?\n",
      "469. Q: Holes?\n",
      "470. Q: Ah, period, completely open.\n",
      "471. Q: The Slovak?\n",
      "472. Q: Tsipi? Helen Teshauer\n",
      "473. Q: Yeah, yes.\n",
      "474. Q: You did.\n",
      "475. Q: That's a little later.\n",
      "476. Q: Yes, up, up, up, right.\n",
      "477. Q: So, you go to BIA, right? The b -- the -- the part that was the women's camp in Birkenau.\n",
      "478. Q: B-- BIA.\n",
      "479. Q: And -- and the men were in BIB.\n",
      "480. Q: Do you remember what barrack you were in?\n",
      "481. Q: In the beginning?\n",
      "482. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "483. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "484. Q: Right.\n",
      "485. Q: Right.\n",
      "486. Q: So how -- how soon is it that you realize in Birkenau there are gas chambers?\n",
      "487. Q: [indecipherable]\n",
      "488. Q: Register.\n",
      "489. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "490. Q: The quarantine block, where they kept people.\n",
      "491. Q: And then they --\n",
      "492. Q: Right, yeah.\n",
      "493. Q: Well, they kept people there --\n",
      "494. Q: And then they took them to the -- to the gas chamber.\n",
      "495. Q: So --\n",
      "496. Q: So -- and sometimes not.\n",
      "497. Q: Right.\n",
      "498. Q: But they started to have -- there were some selections in Auschwitz one, yes? So -- or you don't know?\n",
      "499. Q: But in Birkenau you started to have selections?\n",
      "500. Q: One, yeah.\n",
      "501. Q: To burn.\n",
      "502. Q: So were you working in a demolition, in an au -- in Ausenkommando when you were in Birkenau at first, or did you immediately start working sorting clothes?\n",
      "503. Q: No, sort -- sort clothes, you [indecipherable]\n",
      "504. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "505. Q: Ausenkommando first.\n",
      "506. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "507. Q: Yes, and what did you do?\n",
      "508. Q: 1943.\n",
      "509. Q: We will stop the tape now and take a break.\n",
      "510. Q: Right.\n",
      "511. Q: Alice.\n",
      "512. Q: We were talking about the first job that you had in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n",
      "513. Q: Which is after August, 1942.\n",
      "514. Q: Which is working in the [indecipherable]\n",
      "515. Q: [indecipherable]\n",
      "516. Q: Scarves, and that's what you were wearing, I see.\n",
      "517. Q: And this was where you were sorting clothes?\n",
      "518. Q: So what was the difference between the work that you were doing sorting clothes and the work that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know?\n",
      "519. Q: And -- and your commando wasn't connected with Canada commando?\n",
      "520. Q: No, it was totally separate.\n",
      "521. Q: I see.\n",
      "522. Q: Did you like working in that commando?\n",
      "523. Q: No, no, the other one [indecipherable]\n",
      "524. Q: And wh-why did you like that and you didn't like the Canada?\n",
      "525. Q: I see.\n",
      "526. Q: Do you remember the name of this nice man [indecipherable]\n",
      "527. Q: Ambrose.\n",
      "528. Q: Right. Were you surprised that there would be somebody who was so nice in that position?\n",
      "529. Q: Mm. So how did it happen that you moved from this commando? It was closed?\n",
      "530. Q: Uh-huh, right.\n",
      "531. Q: Right.\n",
      "532. Q: Yeah [indecipherable] but you didn't --\n",
      "533. Q: Were these commandos protected commandos, there were no selections?\n",
      "534. Q: There were selections?\n",
      "535. Q: And he brought her back.\n",
      "536. Q: But were there selections inside the commando?\n",
      "537. Q: Only from the barrack?\n",
      "538. Q: The say -- zaehlappell, when you --\n",
      "539. Q: Right.\n",
      "540. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "541. Q: Oh.\n",
      "542. Q: So you had to jump over the ditch?\n",
      "543. Q: Through it?\n",
      "544. Q: Oh, you mean -- so you went --\n",
      "545. Q: -- over it --\n",
      "546. Q: -- over it from one side to the other.\n",
      "547. Q: And if someone fell --\n",
      "548. Q: That's what you were told?\n",
      "549. Q: So when you went to the Canada commando, you didn't stay for very long.\n",
      "550. Q: How long?\n",
      "551. Q: A few days?\n",
      "552. Q: And that was less difficult for you. You liked that better, being outside [indecipherable]\n",
      "553. Q: And how did that happen? Can you explain?\n",
      "554. Q: A whip? Yes?\n",
      "555. Q: Did you -- did you know of Katya Singer before? Had you met her when you were in Auschwitz one, or --\n",
      "556. Q: No.\n",
      "557. Q: You didn't.\n",
      "558. Q: But you knew about her -- when he said Katya Singer you knew --\n",
      "559. Q: Everybody knew?\n",
      "560. Q: Katya, and you knew it.\n",
      "561. Q: Did you know also that Tsipi, Helen Teshauer was working with Katya?\n",
      "562. Q: At that -- by that time you --\n",
      "563. Q: No.\n",
      "564. Q: And that was it?\n",
      "565. Q: Okay, ne -- nevermore.\n",
      "566. Q: Right. Do you have -- how would you describe Katya, what was she like?\n",
      "567. Q: She was nice?\n",
      "568. Q: It was a very big position for a Jewish woman, wasn't it?\n",
      "569. Q: In that situation.\n",
      "570. Q: Bergen-Belsen?\n",
      "571. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "572. Q: So now you become a Laeuferin, which is essentially a runner, you -- you are --\n",
      "573. Q: You're always running and doing errands and sending messages --\n",
      "574. Q: -- cause there is no phone system.\n",
      "575. Q: Like a messenger.\n",
      "576. Q: Yeah, right, but --\n",
      "577. Q: -- but not -- but obviously not all through the whole system.\n",
      "578. Q: So -- this is going to sound like a really stupid question --\n",
      "579. Q: -- but is there -- is there training? I mean, what did they tell you --\n",
      "580. Q: -- no. They just say go do this, go do that, whatever --\n",
      "581. Q: Right.\n",
      "582. Q: So where do you start living? You move out from the barrack you were in, and you move into barrack four? Is that where all the --\n",
      "583. Q: No.\n",
      "584. Q: Mm-hm.\n",
      "585. Q: Mm-hm.\n",
      "586. Q: Wooden barracks, yeah.\n",
      "587. Q: Right.\n",
      "588. Q: And -- and you knew Mala Zimetbaum?\n",
      "589. Q: What was she like?\n",
      "590. Q: How do you remember her?\n",
      "591. Q: Courageous.\n",
      "592. Q: Right. And what about the other two, there were two other women who were also Laeuferin --\n",
      "593. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "594. Q: Now, was the situation in that block as good as it was in block four or not?\n",
      "595. Q: The -- the earlier block, when you were with [indecipherable]\n",
      "596. Q: Right, so you were safe.\n",
      "597. Q: To wash yourself, yeah.\n",
      "598. Q: The hospital, yeah.\n",
      "599. Q: And where does that come from, what is that --\n",
      "600. Q: Yes.\n",
      "601. Q: Really?\n",
      "602. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "603. Q: How?\n",
      "604. Q: Is there medication? Was there anything that you took?\n",
      "605. Q: But in that condition, had you not been a Laeuferin, and in a protected commando, you probably would have been killed, because you would have looked sick.\n",
      "606. Q: No?\n",
      "607. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "608. Q: Right.\n",
      "609. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "610. Q: Were you surprised at the conditions in block four? That everybody had -- you had your own bed, and --\n",
      "611. Q: You weren't?\n",
      "612. Q: You knew that that was --\n",
      "613. Q: Right.\n",
      "614. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "615. Q: Right.\n",
      "616. Q: Now, are you saying that you did not know tsip -- Tsipi, Helen Teshauer in block four? So she was in that block --\n",
      "617. Q: You didn't -- you never -- you never saw her?\n",
      "618. Q: So there are what, about 90 or a hundred women there.\n",
      "619. Q: More.\n",
      "620. Q: I see.\n",
      "621. Q: Less than a hundred.\n",
      "622. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "623. Q: Right.\n",
      "624. Q: But she often worked at night.\n",
      "625. Q: Tsipi. So maybe that's why you didn't see her, you know.\n",
      "626. Q: But it seems funny that you didn't see her.\n",
      "627. Q: You would see Katya.\n",
      "628. Q: I see.\n",
      "629. Q: And you know her, yes.\n",
      "630. Q: Right.\n",
      "631. Q: Right.\n",
      "632. Q: So you didn't know.\n",
      "633. Q: You knew Anna Pilarchik, Hanka.\n",
      "634. Q: Hanka.\n",
      "635. Q: Alteste, right.\n",
      "636. Q: So how did people get along --\n",
      "637. Q: -- in that? Was it good? It was okay?\n",
      "638. Q: Yes.\n",
      "639. Q: So did you now feel if the war ended --\n",
      "640. Q: -- that you would be safe?\n",
      "641. Q: Right.\n",
      "642. Q: Now, did you menstruate, did you get your period?\n",
      "643. Q: You ne -- you didn't get it even then, because some women there were getting their periods.\n",
      "644. Q: No, but I mean in block four.\n",
      "645. Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n",
      "646. Q: Right.\n",
      "647. Q: Right.\n",
      "648. Q: Right.\n",
      "649. Q: So describe what a day might be like. What would you do, when would you get up, would there be a roll call in that barrack?\n",
      "650. Q: Early -- everybody -- every barrack would have that.\n",
      "651. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "652. Q: And then who would then give you an assignment? You would wait?\n",
      "653. Q: No.\n",
      "654. Q: And who was the they, who would give -- who would tell you what to do?\n",
      "655. Q: So she remembers that the two of you had met each other in barrack four?\n",
      "656. Q: Had seen each other. And you have no recollection.\n",
      "657. Q: Only that -- right, but --\n",
      "658. Q: Uh-huh, right.\n",
      "659. Q: Right.\n",
      "660. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "661. Q: So someone would --\n",
      "662. Q: -- send you --\n",
      "663. Q: So you would translate from what to what?\n",
      "664. Q: And you knew Polish?\n",
      "665. Q: And it's enough -- it's close enough.\n",
      "666. Q: So was a lot of your work doing translations? Was that a great deal of the work?\n",
      "667. Q: Right.\n",
      "668. Q: You don't know.\n",
      "669. Q: In Slovak.\n",
      "670. Q: Right. But you could speak with the Polish women who were there?\n",
      "671. Q: [indecipherable] you could -- you learned how to speak, yeah.\n",
      "672. Q: Polish.\n",
      "673. Q: Right. All right let's --\n",
      "674. Q: -- we're going to take a break and we\"!l change the tape.\n",
      "675. Q: Was there a Christmas celebration of some kind in block four that you remember?[indecipherable]\n",
      "676. Q: Til August, so --\n",
      "677. Q: Anna Pilarchik -- Hannah -- Anna --\n",
      "678. Q: Did report that there was a Christmas tree and a celebration in block four --\n",
      "679. Q: So it's possible.\n",
      "680. Q: It's possible that that's where you --\n",
      "681. Q: But that -- it's a vague memory for you.\n",
      "682. Q: Hm.\n",
      "683. Q: At a certain point, when the transports are coming in to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and from the outside they're killing so many people, do the -- do the internal selections get less, so the people who are already there --\n",
      "684. Q: -- are less likely to be selected?\n",
      "685. Q: Right.\n",
      "686. Q: Because there was too many?\n",
      "687. Q: So what was this like for you, you're seeing these people, you know by now --\n",
      "688. Q: -- the people are being gassed.\n",
      "689. Q: These are not simply people who have died and are being cremated, this is a factory of killing.\n",
      "690. Q: Did you ever want to commit su -- did you ever want to commit suicide?\n",
      "691. Q: No.\n",
      "692. Q: So --\n",
      "693. Q: Because you were tired, or because --\n",
      "694. Q: Yeah, uh-huh\n",
      "695. Q: Now you mentioned the name of a woman guard, Irma Grese, who many people say wer -- was very cruel, but that's now how you remember her?\n",
      "696. Q: She wasn't cruel.\n",
      "697. Q: And was that the only time you had seen her?\n",
      "698. Q: You saw her other times? But she was never cruel to you?\n",
      "699. Q: Wow.\n",
      "700. Q: How come you were there, standing at the entrance?\n",
      "701. Q: Now, why was Laeuferin standing there, is -- in order to translate if there was a need to translate, or --\n",
      "702. Q: No, no, no, I mean when the transports are coming in.\n",
      "703. Q: So would you translate for -- the Germans were not speaking Polish?\n",
      "704. Q: So if they would say something in German --\n",
      "705. Q: You -- having to do with people, nothing.\n",
      "706. Q: Now were you also standing when they took the family camp, the Theresienstadt camp out to be gassed, were you there? Am I wrong, or --\n",
      "707. Q: Not in Auschwitz, that's the pl --\n",
      "708. Q: Right.\n",
      "709. Q: Right.\n",
      "710. Q: But being outside and watching that must have been very upsetting.\n",
      "711. Q: Yes.\n",
      "712. Q: Right.\n",
      "713. Q: What about the women's orchestra, was that important for you?\n",
      "714. Q: Alma Rose.\n",
      "715. Q: Tell me about it\n",
      "716. Q: With polka dots?\n",
      "717. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "718. Q: This is in Auschwitz one?\n",
      "719. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "720. Q: So it was actually a recital. It was -- or ju -- was she just practicing?\n",
      "721. Q: Really. And where would this be, where in Auschwitz would this --\n",
      "722. Q: I see.\n",
      "723. Q: Mm.\n",
      "724. Q: So they had to march in unison, together?\n",
      "725. Q: It wasn't the same.\n",
      "726. Q: Now, there are some people who think they remember the orchestra playing when people went to the gas, and other people saying there was never an orchestra.\n",
      "727. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "728. Q: Really?\n",
      "729. Q: So the music for you was really important.\n",
      "730. Q: Did you know that Tsipi was in the orchestra, that she played mandolin?\n",
      "731. Q: She played mandolin and when they went -- they -- they marched out, so they would play for people who were going to work, they would come by block four and pick her up, and she would go with them and play. I don't know if she ever played concerts, but she played --\n",
      "732. Q: You didn't know that.\n",
      "733. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "734. Q: Yes.\n",
      "735. Q: Right.\n",
      "736. Q: In the morning you worked, she was playing [indecipherable] know.\n",
      "737. Q: Right. But other than your friend Dieter Rishter --\n",
      "738. Q: -- did you have another -- any other close friends, or was she the closest person?\n",
      "739. Q: Yes, but she was really --\n",
      "740. Q: So that was very hard on you to lose her.\n",
      "741. Q: Still hard?\n",
      "742. Q: I see what you're saying.\n",
      "743. Q: Right.\n",
      "744. Q: Were -- the -- the women that you saw, did most of them have one very close person?\n",
      "745. Q: You don't know.\n",
      "746. Q: You don't know how they -- how it was working.\n",
      "747. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "748. Q: Right.\n",
      "749. Q: Right. Did you ever see men coming into the camp and working?\n",
      "750. Q: Wasn't it the case that there was some -- somebody who was working the Sonderkommando, who spoke with you about what happened? Some person who saw you in Auschwitz, and talked to you, who came in the women's camp? Didn't you write about that?\n",
      "751. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "752. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "753. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "754. Q: Yes?\n",
      "755. Q: He found a mirror? This was after the war, this was --\n",
      "756. Q: -- during? He found a mirror and so he was fixing himself up.\n",
      "757. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "758. Q: But there were a number of times when you actually saved people, you risked your life.\n",
      "759. Q: Not just with -- with your friend Dieter, that was very dangerous to go into block 25 to bring her out.\n",
      "760. Q: In front, even in front.\n",
      "761. Q: Cause clearly she was waiting.\n",
      "762. Q: And how did you do that?\n",
      "763. Q: So |-let's stop the tape and we\" start with that --\n",
      "764. Q: -- on the next tape with you -- with getting Vera out.\n",
      "765. Q: Okay, before we talk about your saving Vera Isen, tell me what impelled you to do this? It was so dangerous, you could have been caught in a second and killed.\n",
      "766. Q: What made you do it? How --\n",
      "767. Q: And nobody saw you, Irma didn't see you. Irma -- irm -- was Irma Weiss, right?\n",
      "768. Q: Irna, rather, right.\n",
      "769. Q: Right.\n",
      "770. Q: She knew.\n",
      "771. Q: But if they were going through the -- th -- the process, this wasn't outside, this was inside --\n",
      "772. Q: -- were they not taking down names?\n",
      "773. Q: They can -- not that -- it was just n -- just moving people.\n",
      "774. Q: I see, so --\n",
      "775. Q: I see, so they can -- there was no way to check if you --\n",
      "776. Q: I see. Now, there were other people in that room.\n",
      "777. Q: Did they realize what you were doing, or you don't know?\n",
      "778. Q: That was people who were deteriorated and -- and close to death also, right.\n",
      "779. Q: So she escaped herself.\n",
      "780. Q: Right, right.\n",
      "781. Q: Right.\n",
      "782. Q: Yes.\n",
      "783. Q: And what gave you -- were you holding onto this young -- this 16 year old girl when you said to this other woman if you -- if you will take --\n",
      "784. Q: You just took her.\n",
      "785. Q: [indecipherable] you just took her.\n",
      "786. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "787. Q: And what brought --\n",
      "788. Q: -- together. And what made you th -- I understand this was some instinctual thing --\n",
      "789. Q: -- o-on your part, but what made you say that to her? Because you didn't think that the 16 year old would survive if she didn't have somebody?\n",

      "821. Q: In a situation that was --\n",
      "822. Q: -- clearly completely crazy.\n",
      "823. Q: But in order to live in it, you had to think in a practical way --\n",
      "824. Q: -- not in some fantasy land, right?\n",
      "825. Q: So you were thinking and strategizing --\n",
      "826. Q: -- and seeing --\n",
      "827. Q: -- little ways.\n",
      "828. Q: To save yourself and to save some [indecipherable]\n",

      "926. Q: Four.\n",
      "927. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "928. Q: But had you heard about that before it happened, or as a rumor, or only after?\n",
      "929. Q: Only after.\n",
      "930. Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.\n",
      "931. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "932. Q: Do you remember when you left Birkenau before you actually were evacuated? Did you evacuate and go back to Auschwitz one? Or did you leave from Birkenau and start the Death March immediately?\n",
      "933. Q: Right away?\n",
      "934. Q: And that was January 18?\n",
      "935. Q: So, before you do that, let me -- did you smoke when you were in Auschwitz?\n",
      "936. Q: Sometimes?\n",
      "937. Q: I understood that men were allowed cigarettes but women were not.\n",
      "938. Q: And do you have any -- do you have any understanding of why women were not allowed to smoke and men were?\n",
      "939. Q: Isn't -- isn't it strange?\n",
      "940. Q: You -- you -- in your --\n",
      "941. Q: But it was clear to you that you were not supposed to do it?\n",
      "942. Q: Sometimes.\n",
      "943. Q: Was it helpful to smoke?\n",
      "944. Q: And where did you smoke?\n",
      "945. Q: In block four?\n",
      "946. Q: And did other women in block four smoke --\n",
      "947. Q: I see.\n",
      "948. Q: So that's how you got, somebody would just say that you want a cigarette?\n",
      "949. Q: Uh-huh.\n",
      "950. Q: But how would people get cigarettes, they would barter with something? H-How did these women get cigarettes do you think?\n",
      "951. Q: Yeah.\n",
      "952. Q: So you had access in that barrack to things, because you could walk around and you also were able to do that, whereas most women couldn't do that in the camp.\n",
      "953. Q: No, you had access to be able to barter with the Germans.\n",
      "954. Q: No?\n",
      "955. Q: As a [indecipherable]. Right.\n",
      "956. Q: Really?\n",

      "958. Q: You couldn't do that?\n",
      "959. Q: It wasn't that --\n",
      "960. Q: That -- that became the biggest.\n",
      "961. Q: On the bottom.\n",
      "962. Q: Did you talk about food together? Did -- did women talk about recipes of food?\n",
      "963. Q: No.\n",
      "964. Q: The Hungarians did.\n",
      "965. Q: So why do you think the Hungarians did it, and the other people didn't --\n",

      "983. Q: Right. Okay.\n",
      "984. Q: When someone says the word Auschwitz to you, what's the first thing that comes to mind?\n",
      "985. Q: You don't like to hear about it.\n",
      "986. Q: So do you -- do you have a lot of friends who were from Auschwitz, a lot of people you know, or you -- you don't?\n",
      "987. Q: And so that you don't -- over the years you haven't talked about this very much?\n",
      "988. Q: Right.\n",
      "989. Q: Right.\n",
      "990. Q: Right.\n",

      "997. Q: Ah, you're having dreams with your brother in it.\n",
      "998. Q: Yes. So when -- did you find out in Auschwitz what had happened to your brother and your mother and father, or was it after?\n",

      "1000. Q: Yes.\n",
      "1001. Q: Yes.\n",
      "1002. Q: So twice your brother left a place --\n",
