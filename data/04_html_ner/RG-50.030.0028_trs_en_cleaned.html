<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Tom, what we need to do...excuse me...we need less of the history. </sentence><sentence id="26">We need your story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Okay....It's a typical <span class="populated place">Jewish town</span>, a <span class="populated place">shtetl</span>, hundred percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="30">The Christian population lived around the <span class="populated place">town</span>, on the <span class="env feature">foothills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">About 3,000 Jews used to live there. </sentence><sentence id="32">Uh...And the...this <span class="populated place">town</span> was built in a <span class="dlf">valley</span> surrounded by <span class="env feature">hills</span>, or <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, and this the Germans later used for the purpose which we will come to it. </sentence><sentence id="33">We had..uh...one <span class="building">shul</span> and about three, four Beis Medresh [NB: <span class="building">Beth Midrash</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="34">Very deeply orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="35">As a matter of fact, I remember there was next to it a <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Zamo __</span>, and one Saturday, some Jewish or free...they called them "free thinkers" did come with <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">On top of it they were without caps, without a hat. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I remember the...half of the <span class="populated place">town</span> they chased them out with sticks and with stones because they come on a Saturday and...um... Saturday, Friday in the evening and the next day Saturday, the <span class="populated place">town</span> was quiet because it was a holy day, like nobody in the <span class="populated place">town</span> except in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="38">I remember Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="39">You could feel it in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">You could see the people moving by to...to the <span class="building">Beis Medresh</span>...or to the <span class="building">temple</span>, to the <span class="building">shul</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">It was deeply orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="42">There were a few which did try...uh...to reach out. </sentence><sentence id="43">For instance, my father. </sentence><sentence id="44">In our <span class="populated place">town</span> everyone had a name; on top of it, he had a special name given. </sentence><sentence id="45">For example, if he does...he didn't have a leg, they called him [Leme Yoine (ph)]. [ </sentence><sentence id="46">Yoine (ph)] was his name, because uh...my father, why I'm telling him was because my father was already what you call "free thinker." </sentence><sentence id="47">He did try to move out from the orthodox ways, so they called him {Leibele Goy (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="48">It was..., my [NB: his] first name was [Leibele (ph)], he was Goy  because he did...uh...smoke cigarettes sometimes Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="49">They did know it. </sentence><sentence id="50">You can't sneak...you can't smoke cigarettes in <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> but when the...the <span class="dlf">shutters</span> in the the <span class="building">home</span> weren't closed, all the peoples in the neighbor did know that my dad was smoking cigarettes Saturday because of it. </sentence><sentence id="51">| remember mine...if you talk about my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="52">I will tell you a story which will give you an idea. </sentence><sentence id="53">Uh...For example, my father had a Polish friend, a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="54">He send him out to buy pork meat usual; because...uh...nobody could see my dad be going into...uh...to buy pork meat, of course. </sentence><sentence id="55">So he sent this Christian friend. </sentence><sentence id="56">And I...once Iremember and my father told me, "Try it." </sentence><sentence id="57">And I tried it and I liked it. </sentence><sentence id="58">But in that time they used to live in so-called, in a [<span class="building">Urisha</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="59">You know what [<span class="populated place">Urisha</span> (ph)] is? [ </sentence><sentence id="60"><span class="building">Urisha</span> (ph)] is a <span class="building">house</span> because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and later when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">So...uh...finally when L...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this whole <span class="building">house</span> was divided with <span class="interior space">partitions</span> that everybody could hear everybody across the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she noticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. </sentence><sentence id="63">So what...the next thing I remember she opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> where my father lived and said, "Tom." " </sentence><sentence id="64">Toivi," not "Tom." </sentence><sentence id="65">Not Tom. </sentence><sentence id="66">"Toivi, you eat pork meat?" </sentence><sentence id="67">I said, "Yes, Mimi, I ate." " </sentence><sentence id="68">You know what [<span class="building">Streicher</span>" (ph)] is?" " </sentence><sentence id="69">Yes, I know what [<span class="building">Streicher</span> (ph)] is." " </sentence><sentence id="70">You will go to <span class="dlf">Hell</span>." </sentence><sentence id="71">I know about Hell because my uncle told me stories, how they burn people and everything else. " </sentence><sentence id="72">Promise me, you wouldn't eat any more." </sentence><sentence id="73">So I say I wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="74">And she left. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I was such...so scared about Hell and everything else that immediately...it was a shock to me I remember...what I remember is I... was in a high fever and laid down the <span class="spatial object">sofa</span> and my whole head was just like a...like a <span class="building">mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">And I was sick for about two days. </sentence><sentence id="77">They called the doctor and that time, you know, the doctor...doctors used to come to the <span class="building">home</span>, and he said, "Give him aspirin. </sentence><sentence id="78">I don't see anything." </sentence><sentence id="79">And finally when my Mimi did come to visit me, and I remember the first thing what I ask her was, "Mimi, will I go to <span class="region">Hell</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="80">And she probably understood what the problem is; that I simply, that I'm that scared. </sentence><sentence id="81">I'm sick from being scared. </sentence><sentence id="82">And she said, "Oh, Toivi, you know, don't worry because when your Bar Mitzvah will come, God will forgive you everything." </sentence><sentence id="83">Now, this...this had a fourfold effect because I wasn't afraid anymore. </sentence><sentence id="84">I was okay, but I again I did...when mine...the next time my dad did ask me if you want a piece of pork meat, I said "Yes," because anyway, in about two, three years God will forgive me. </sentence><sentence id="85">So anyway, I just tell you a little picture it was. </sentence><sentence id="86">Some people they tried to get out from the <span class="dlf">circle</span> of...uh... orthodox behavior, but it was very...it was trying. </sentence><sentence id="87">But...I otherwise, actually it was a deeply <span class="populated place">Jewish town</span>.... uh ...with a very big respect for the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="88">The Rabbi was our authority. </sentence><sentence id="89">And...uh...Friday, with the <span class="spatial object">shochet</span> and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="90">And so it was "til 1939, when the war started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Uh... remember the <span class="populated place">town</span>...you know, we didn't have...uh... <span class="spatial object">radios</span> in that time, so any news  was...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy. </sentence><sentence id="156">His name was Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the <span class="populated place">town</span> to the <span class="building">marketplace</span> and drummed up until all the people had come together, and now he said, "Hello, hello. </sentence><sentence id="157">This is the news..." and so on. </sentence><sentence id="158">He did say that a war started. </sentence><sentence id="159">Hitler invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>, and a mobilization is in order and...uh...he was the latest news from the <span class="building">Burgermeister's office</span>, <span class="building">Mayor's office</span>, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="160">And he advised to glue in strips of paper on the <span class="dlf">windows</span> so they shouldn't shatter if the bombs fall down, and that was the news. </sentence><sentence id="161">So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in strips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our place too. </sentence><sentence id="162">And later I remember <span class="spatial object">planes</span> coming. </sentence><sentence id="163">I remember <span class="spatial object">Polish plane</span> shot down, and the next I remember my family was moving out from the <span class="populated place">town</span>, hiding in a <span class="populated place">village</span> from the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="164">We were afraid that <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> will be bombed because there was a big <span class="building">factory</span>, a <span class="building">military factory</span> in <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> uh producing material for fortification purposes. </sentence><sentence id="165">So I went to this <span class="populated place">village</span>, <span class="populated place">Panska- Dolina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">Over there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> is fighting against <span class="country">Poland</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="167">I remember the speech from the Polish officer, that they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to the last drop of blood. </sentence><sentence id="168">And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and now we are a group of people about 25. </sentence><sentence id="169">We don't know what to do, scared in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">The young people say, "Oh, we will run away from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="171">We are going across the <span class="env feature">river Bug</span> to the Russians." </sentence><sentence id="172">The older people, mine parents included...my father, "No, we're going back to <span class="populated place">Izbica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">Germans. </sentence><sentence id="174">Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people." </sentence><sentence id="175">And I remember we split then. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was in the night. </sentence><sentence id="177">I remember the stars and could be about maybe 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed. </sentence><sentence id="178">And the sons did walk to the <span class="region">east</span>, and some parents did go back to <span class="populated place">Izbica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And I went back with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="180">We come to <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> and now...uh.. (chuckle) interesting news. </sentence><sentence id="181">The Germans are leaving. </sentence><sentence id="182">So I said, "The Germans are leaving. </sentence><sentence id="183">I didn't see a German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="184">I must see a German soldier." </sentence><sentence id="185">So I went down looking for a German soldier. " </sentence><sentence id="186">Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the <span class="building">bakery</span> buying bread." </sentence><sentence id="187">So I went to the <span class="building">bakery</span> and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with <span class="spatial object">bikes</span> and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="188">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language. ( </sentence><sentence id="189">laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. </sentence><sentence id="190">We did talk a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="191">| Yiddish and they're German. </sentence><sentence id="192">There's nothing wrong with it. </sentence><sentence id="193">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="194">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="195">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the <span class="dlf">demarcation line</span>, and they moved out. </sentence><sentence id="196">And the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="197">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="198">The Russians are leaving again. </sentence><sentence id="199">The Germans are coming. </sentence><sentence id="200">So again what should we do? </sentence><sentence id="201">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out. </sentence><sentence id="202">I know Russian. </sentence><sentence id="203">I know the language. </sentence><sentence id="204">Let go out from here." </sentence><sentence id="205">And my father said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="206">Actually he bought a horse and <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="207">And later he said, "No, I was born here. </sentence><sentence id="208">I could die here." </sentence><sentence id="209"> And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="210">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="211">He was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="212">He was a invalid. </sentence><sentence id="213">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time. </sentence><sentence id="214">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. </sentence><sentence id="215">He was born here and he...he could die here. </sentence><sentence id="216">And he stayed. </sentence><sentence id="217">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="218">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="220">We should go. </sentence><sentence id="221">But we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="222">The Russians left and <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> was a <span class="region">no-man's land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">No Russians. </sentence><sentence id="224">No Germans. </sentence><sentence id="225">The Germans did come. </sentence><sentence id="226">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> in a <span class="populated place">district town</span> of <span class="populated place">Krasnystaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227"><span class="populated place">Izbica</span> was nobody. </sentence><sentence id="228">So two...the third night, sitting in my <span class="interior space">room</span> I hear a big explosion. </sentence><sentence id="229">And suddenly screaming, yelling, "What's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="230">A group of Jews stood on the <span class="dlf">street</span> outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they killed a few and they wounded a few. </sentence><sentence id="232">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="233">So people were scared to go outside the <span class="populated place">town</span> and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. </sentence><sentence id="234">Still I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="235">By the way, this is the same, this is my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat... shouldn't eat unkosher. </sentence><sentence id="236">Under...under her leadership, they went to <span class="populated place">Krasnystaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">Actually, to invite Germans to come to <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> because it...it is no law in <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> and we are afraid and that they must come in. </sentence><sentence id="238">So Germans did come into <span class="populated place">Izbica</span> to protect the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="239">No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. </sentence><sentence id="240">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="241">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the <span class="dlf">streets</span> so they were pretty quiet. </sentence><sentence id="242">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="243">I remember a...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. </sentence><sentence id="244">It...it was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. </sentence><sentence id="245">There were two of them. </sentence><sentence id="246">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels. </sentence><sentence id="247">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">They both committed suicide in...in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> after the war, being in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in <span class="populated place">Izbica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights. </sentence><sentence id="252">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the <span class="populated place">town</span>, it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="253">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="254">In the beginning!But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. </sentence><sentence id="255">So...now it was too late, and we were in a <span class="dlf">trap</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="257">There were still families. </sentence><sentence id="258">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live. </sentence><sentence id="259">There were...uh...there were <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> and Jews were forced to go to work in <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">Later, as I said,  there were <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> where they went out for a month or for a week. </sentence><sentence id="262">They worked. </sentence><sentence id="263">Later they...they were exchanged. </sentence><sentence id="264">New Jews did come and they were let <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans in that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat." </sentence><sentence id="266">And through the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people. </sentence><sentence id="267">The old ones...the first ones should be released. </sentence><sentence id="268">So it wasn't a order. </sentence><sentence id="269">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor. </sentence><sentence id="270">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. </sentence><sentence id="271">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="272">We heard about beating. </sentence><sentence id="273">We heard about torture, and people refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="274">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened. " </sentence><sentence id="275">Aktion" is a roundup. </sentence><sentence id="276">It started with roundups to the <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">They would come in the morning and told the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span> to deliver 500 men or 200 men. </sentence><sentence id="278">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>, beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together. </sentence><sentence id="279">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> "til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: What were you and your parents doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Twas a oov in the picture and later sot to the - So in that time. </sentence><sentence id="409">| was alreadv in  told me, "Tom, would you like to help me? </sentence><sentence id="410">I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>." </sentence><sentence id="411">So I said, "Okay, I will just tell my dad." </sentence><sentence id="412">Told my dad that I will be a whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)]...I will call it from now on "<span class="building">garage</span>," because Americans are familiar with what a...what a <span class="building">garage</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="413">And while I was working next day, he said...[Solecky (ph)]..."Listen, why don't you work with me. </sentence><sentence id="414">Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="415">Come to me." </sentence><sentence id="416">And I thought it was a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="417">First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span>, and I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="418">And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky (ph)] and it was dangerous because the <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span> of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you know, spotless. </sentence><sentence id="419">And I worked very hard and I done a good job. </sentence><sentence id="420">And as I see it now, it was a good choice because later when the <span class="populated place">death camps</span> did come, I was protected practically...practically the last minute, and I was able to see how <span class="populated place">town</span> is sinking down, myself being protected. </sentence><sentence id="421">I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. </sentence><sentence id="422">I've seen it. </sentence><sentence id="423">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="424">Going back to the <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425">Suddenly, <span class="spatial object">transports</span> arrived from...uh...<span class="populated place">Pozna_</span>...from west...from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>...<span class="populated place">Pozna_</span>, <span class="populated place">Ko_o</span>, <span class="populated place">Konin</span>, and lot of Jews arrived; we divided...the Judenrat divided the people to different <span class="building">houses</span> and that time I did get very close with...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)], who was...uh...a dentist's son from <span class="populated place">Ko_o</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">In our place used to live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="427">Once I remember...it was the evening...I still remember my mother standing close...close to the <span class="dlf">window</span> with Mr. Kohn and his wife, and discussing a letter. </sentence><sentence id="428">And I listen: "gassing people, gassing....". </sentence><sentence id="429">And my mother I remember saying, "It's impossible.

</sentence><sentence id="3057">We weren't able...but what's happened over there...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, sorting some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3058">You  4 could see them from far away. </sentence><sentence id="3059">And while working, when we were able to get closer to them, we showed them that we are hiding money

</sentence><sentence id="3061">Nevertheless, most of them were later brought to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3062">This didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="3063">Later was the...the <span class="building">barrack</span>...Waldkommander thought maybe I could work over there. </sentence><sentence id="3064">In the beginning, it was very nice because I had a method. </sentence><sentence id="3065">I noticed that the Germans like clean people. </sentence><sentence id="3066">They like people going straight fast. </sentence><sentence id="3067">The moment you see a run..rundown Jews, broken-down Jew, they killing him. </sentence><sentence id="3068">So always I kept myself clean. </sentence><sentence id="3069">I put even my pants under me when I slept. </sentence><sentence id="3070">They should be ironed with my body, straight. </sentence><sentence id="3071">I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I could go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3072">But I always looked a <span class="region">open area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3073">So I did go to work for the <span class="building">Waldkommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3074">The foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3075">You could come me." </sentence><sentence id="3076">We cut the <span class="env feature">wood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3077">Later, ...uh...they're building a

class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3101">And the one part was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3102">And the <span class="dlf">door</span> was open, and I heard some talking inside, so I did get up. </sentence><sentence id="3103">I've seen something is going on, and I did go to my friend in the [<span class="building">bank</span> (ph)] kommando. </sentence><sentence id="3104">And I go to him, and it was dark in the <span class="building">barrack</span> because what I know in which <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> he is, and I tell him, "Listen, Shmufel], Hear what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="3105">Something...something is happening here." </sentence><sentence id="3106">So instead to answer me, he hit me in my face with a...with something...some kind of metal, I know. </sentence><sentence id="3107">So I thought "If he knows and he doesn't care, it's okay." </sentence><sentence id="3108">So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to escape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too. </sentence><sentence id="3109">Anyway, I told you. </sentence><sentence id="3110">But again, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a whole group of kapos being taken to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3111">So I was wondering what's happened? </sentence><sentence id="3112">But again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used to sort <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>, has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was obvious that he did betray the action. </sentence><sentence id="3113">But to make it short again, we killed him later. </sentence><sentence id="3114">Before  5 we made the revolt. </sentence><sentence id="3115">He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3294">Q: Tell us about the revolt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3296">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3297">Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die. </sentence><sentence id="3298">When...uh...even if the...the war would stop right now and then the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> could be free, we will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="3299">So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us. </sentence><sentence id="3300">Everybody did want to escape. </sentence><sentence id="3301">I think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind. </sentence><sentence id="3302">Although some people were resigned. </sentence><sentence id="3303">They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even with this terrible situation did pray. </sentence><sentence id="3304">I remember Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="3305">And they did fast, and they did say all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in God and their tradition everything else. </sentence><sentence id="3306">Now, there always was... wouldn't say organization...there were a few people, influenced people in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>...respected people. </sentence><sentence id="3307">It was a <span class="building">Hazzan</span>, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3308">I don't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And was Leon Feldhandler. </sentence><sentence id="3310">His father was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in <span class="populated place">Zolkiewka</span>, in this <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3311">And there were some talks...talks about the revolt. </sentence><sentence id="3312">I was close to Feldhandler because he was a friend of my father in <span class="populated place">Izbica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3313">He was in <span class="populated place">Izbica ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3314">He was taken to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> from <span class="populated place">Izbica ghetto</span> in the time when I escaped to...to <span class="populated place">Stryy</span>, and they caught me in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3315">But it wasn't until a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> arrived. </sentence><sentence id="3316">When the <span class="region">Eastern Front</span> was coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3317">And that time they took all the Jews from <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, and from <span class="populated place">Lida</span> and they brought them to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3318">I mean not all of them. </sentence><sentence id="3319">A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some <span class="spatial object">transports</span> come to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3320">And in that...in this particular <span class="spatial object">transport</span> they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="3321">Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3322">Because they recognized as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3323">In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3324">Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWs trained in the art of fighting. </sentence><sentence id="3325">Former soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3326">And they picked up a man called Pechersky. </sentence><sentence id="3327">He was a officer in the Soviet Army, and ...to work with us. </sentence><sentence id="3328">Pretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon Feldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want to dwell much on it, they formed a organization. </sentence><sentence id="3329">From that time on some concrete things happened. </sentence><sentence id="3330">I find out about a week before about the revolt. </sentence><sentence id="3331">Uh...That time I was working as a Feuermann. </sentence><sentence id="3332">How did I come to be...to get this job? </sentence><sentence id="3333">Feuermann is like firemeister...master. </sentence><sentence id="3334">All the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was burned. </sentence><sentence id="3335">While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3336">Later with the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span> was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire. </sentence><sentence id="3337">Taking it to the fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there. </sentence><sentence id="3338">Did bring him some food. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger <span class="spatial object">oven</span>, I was working over there as a steady personnel. </sentence><sentence id="3340">My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of  6 the view from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3341">I could see them. </sentence><sentence id="3342">They can't see me. </sentence><sentence id="3343">From the <span class="dlf">window</span>, I was able to see. </sentence><sentence id="3344">But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating. </sentence><sentence id="3345">But anyway, so...they planned to kill a German in my place. </sentence><sentence id="3346">So this way...but I did need to be contacted. </sentence><sentence id="3347">Otherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this place, I would chase him out, being afraid myself. </sentence><sentence id="3348">So he calls me in the evening and tells me, "Toivi, I must tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="3349">I know you. </sentence><sentence id="3350">I know your father. </sentence><sentence id="3351">I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="3352">We need your place to kill a German." </sentence><sentence id="3353">I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="3354">Later, I find out about what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="3355">And I was informed on the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3356">I... understood that something is going on, and I was informed about Sasha. </sentence><sentence id="3357">Especially I was a guy... was a guy in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> which always did run around. </sentence><sentence id="3358">You know, I didn't keep in a place. </sentence><sentence id="3359">I was always hyper and would just run. </sentence><sentence id="3360">I did want to know everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything. </sentence><sentence id="3361">So in this way I did become, I was involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="3362">So I know the first plan was...there were different plans. </sentence><sentence id="3363">The first plan was to dig a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> from the <span class="building">blacksmith shop</span> through the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> to <span class="region">outside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3364">But when they analyzed it, it's did come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the <span class="env feature">soil</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3365">They need to find a way. </sentence><sentence id="3366">And when...let's assume everything is okay. </sentence><sentence id="3367">Six hundred people should go through the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> single file without quarrel will take a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="3368">Isn't practical. </sentence><sentence id="3369">They threw it away. </sentence><sentence id="3370">The next one was to poison...to kill all the Nazis while they're in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called "putzers," which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the <span class="building">barrack</span> to go to the Germans and while they are in the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3371">This time to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and get their weapons. </sentence><sentence id="3372">But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they didn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job. </sentence><sentence id="3373">Anyway, a plan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between four and five. </sentence><sentence id="3374">We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality. </sentence><sentence id="3375">Discipline. </sentence><sentence id="3376">And the plan was that the heads of the <span class="building">workshops</span> because besides the people working in conjunction of the extermination, there were <span class="building">workshops</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3377">Tailors, shoemakers working for the Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force. </sentence><sentence id="3378">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="3379">So they established a few small <span class="building">workshops</span> for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3380">And always a German have something...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the <span class="building">shop</span> should make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for appointments between 4 and 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="3381">And over there there would be some people which will... which will kill them. </sentence><sentence id="3382">So I know about this plan. </sentence><sentence id="3383">And this should happen between 4 and 5, and the whole lager should look normal. </sentence><sentence id="3384">We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time. </sentence><sentence id="3385">I remember I was in that time waiting and <span class="dlf">mine fire place</span>...in <span class="dlf">mine place</span>...where I burned  7 ..where the <span class="spatial object">oven</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="3386">I pushed all these papers against the <span class="dlf">window</span> so nobody should be able to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents, papers, we threw in in the sides, and the the <span class="spatial object">oven</span> was in the middle, and I just later burn it. </sentence><sentence id="3387">So anyway was a <span class="dlf">window</span> so I blocked the <span class="dlf">window</span> and was waiting. </sentence><sentence id="3388">And..uh...now I see a group...uh ... because they were divided. </sentence><sentence id="3389">The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different places in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> waiting for the Germans to be lured over there. </sentence><sentence id="3390">So I see the group is supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to my <span class="spatial object">oven</span>, but they're passing me. </sentence><sentence id="3391">They're going in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="3392">So I was panicky, but pretty soon a Jew called....from _6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, "Tom, they decide not to do anything to your place because the guard...the tower guard was very close." </sentence><sentence id="3393">I was very close to the <span class="dlf">fence</span> and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be suspicious. " </sentence><sentence id="3394">We rather...we'll kill him in the men's <span class="interior space">storeroom</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3395">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the <span class="dlf">gate</span> leading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. </sentence><sentence id="3396">In <span class="populated place">Lager 1</span> were the <span class="building">building</span> where they used to sleep and these <span class="building">workshop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3397"><span class="spatial object">Lager 2</span> we sorted, and <span class="building">Lager 3</span> we did burn, and <span class="building">Lager 4</span>, we were building something over there. </sentence><sentence id="3398">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this <span class="dlf">gate</span> was very close to the <span class="interior space">storeroom</span> I just seen them both coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3399">He was called in..in to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. </sentence><sentence id="3400">And he did go in and suspected nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3401">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. </sentence><sentence id="3402">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming in, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!" </sentence><sentence id="3403">immediately. " </sentence><sentence id="3404">Attention." </sentence><sentence id="3405">And start attention, took this leather jacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather jacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax and we had a first gun. </sentence><sentence id="3406">I was scared up to that point. </sentence><sentence id="3407">I remember when he was killed and the guy who killed him did come out. </sentence><sentence id="3408">He's a little bit blood on his shoe. </sentence><sentence id="3409">He patted his pocket like to say, the gun is here. </sentence><sentence id="3410">I...my whole ...I wasn't scared any more. </sentence><sentence id="3411">I did want only to know what will happen to me a half an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="3412">That I did want to know. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And I...L..I did know there's no way back. </sentence><sentence id="3414">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="3415">They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything could be.... And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the <span class="dlf">door</span> over the <span class="building">barrack</span> and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they killed him anyway in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little <span class="spatial object">train</span>, like a <span class="spatial object">miners train</span>, for the miners. </sentence><sentence id="3417">Little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> with a little electric engine. </sentence><sentence id="3418">And the German who was the head of this little <span class="spatial object">train</span> which connected all the <span class="building">Lagers</span> with <span class="building">Lager 3</span>, was already killed. </sentence><sentence id="3419">But inside I notice there's canned food. </sentence><sentence id="3420">So a few <span class="spatial object">cans</span>, put into my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="3421">And I remember I had friend. </sentence><sentence id="3422"><span class="populated place">Linda Karoten</span> (nh). </sentence><sentence id="3423">Linda ~ And she said. " </sentence><sentence id="3424">Tom. </sentence><sentence id="3425">vou're  8 group did come to me, "Tom, maybe you have some money?" </sentence><sentence id="3426">Because many times when I did burn in my <span class="spatial object">oven</span> the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some money did come through in the ashes. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold always. </sentence><sentence id="3428">It did lose the luster, but it was not.... So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did give him some money. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And the Germans were killed. </sentence><sentence id="3430">Nobody did know. </sentence><sentence id="3431">I was wondering that...this was like normal. </sentence><sentence id="3432">First of all the <span class="spatial object">Kapos</span>...the <span class="spatial object">Kapos</span> which were...there were two Kapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday. </sentence><sentence id="3433">And they have done it. </sentence><sentence id="3434">And I remember like every day, singing. </sentence><sentence id="3435">We went back to <span class="building">Lager 1</span> for...uh...supper. </sentence><sentence id="3436">And now the biggest shock. </sentence><sentence id="3437">And this was I think was the...the most important ingredients of the success was so few people did know. </sentence><sentence id="3438">There were...we were about 600 people. </sentence><sentence id="3439">And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> in front of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3440">Believe it or not, practically the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was still like every day standing in the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3441">Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know. </sentence><sentence id="3442">But soon one told another one, "Listen, forget about supper. </sentence><sentence id="3443">Something is going on. </sentence><sentence id="3444">Let us grab an <span class="spatial object">ax</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3445">Grab anything and be prepared." </sentence><sentence id="3446">Now the dangerous moment did come because up "til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come. </sentence><sentence id="3447">Each German has a place to watch. </sentence><sentence id="3448">The <span class="spatial object">sorters</span>, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing. </sentence><sentence id="3449">But he was allowed to go for a cup of coffee or whatever he want. </sentence><sentence id="3450">And another German ...let say...from the <span class="spatial object">shoe sorters</span>, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's suppose to be by sorting clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3451">He wasn't suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="3452">He thought, "Oh, maybe my friend went for a cup of coffee." </sentence><sentence id="3453">But now, 5:30. </sentence><sentence id="3454">Well, the...the time did come close when all the Germans supposed to be in this place, <span class="populated place">Lager Ein</span>, to...they witnessed the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="3455">And now if a German is missing, they will look each other. </sentence><sentence id="3456">So we did know that the crucial time is coming and... uh...uh...the <span class="dlf">line</span> in front of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> start to...to dwindle and I remember a shot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3457">And why L...now...a one Kapo whistled a whistle, like for a...like for a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="3458">Normal. </sentence><sentence id="3459">And made it a little bit earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3460">The original plan was actually to march... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3627">Q: Stick with what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3629">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="3630">The original plan was to march out to the <span class="dlf">front gate</span>, but we heard a shot and the plan was disregarded to march out to the <span class="dlf">front gate</span> because probably the...the guard wouldn't know what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. </sentence><sentence id="3631">But I heard a shot, Sasha jumping on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and he start to talk, "Listen." </sentence><sentence id="3632">Something in this sense. " </sentence><sentence id="3633">Listen to me." </sentence><sentence id="3634">I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. </sentence><sentence id="3635">It was very short. </sentence><sentence id="3636">"The time did come that we will take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="3637">We killed practical all the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3638">Now let's stood up and fight our way out." </sentence><sentence id="3639">In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he said was: "If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the story of <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3640">And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing. </sentence><sentence id="3641">And suddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still talking somebody yelled, "Hoorah!" </sentence><sentence id="3642">from the people standing. </sentence><sentence id="3643">And another one picked up, "Hoorah!"; </sentence><sentence id="3644">and the third one, and suddenly everybody, "<span class="populated place">Hoorah</span>, <span class="populated place">Hoorah</span>," and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="3645">I  9 didn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3646">I prepared a knife from before. </sentence><sentence id="3647">It was easy to hide a knife. </sentence><sentence id="3648">Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was written Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. </sentence><sentence id="3649">It's some kind traditional knife. </sentence><sentence id="3650">Was big, so I took it. </sentence><sentence id="3651">My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> leading up to <span class="populated place">Lager 1</span>, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by accident...did start to drive in with his <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, and he was thrown immediately from his <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, and I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun. </sentence><sentence id="3652">And while running through I know... remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like that...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. </sentence><sentence id="3653">He could use the rifle and shot, but he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning around. </sentence><sentence id="3654">He didn't...he didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3655">And I was running to go with the people to the <span class="dlf">front gate</span> and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like from bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a <span class="building">barrack</span> is a German with a machine gun shotting at us. </sentence><sentence id="3656">And here two my friend fall down, another one third. </sentence><sentence id="3657">And I started to back up. </sentence><sentence id="3658">I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="3659">While everybody was running...running to the front, I did run back. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And...uh... some way I find my way to a little <span class="dlf">gate</span> in a <span class="interior space">hallway</span> for the guards, because between the <span class="dlf">fences</span> guards were walking, this time empty. </sentence><sentence id="3661">Probably I went into that <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3662">Luckily, I

class="dlf">line</span> when machine guns are shotting at us to go through the <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3674">They start to climb on top of the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3675">In that time exactly when I was halfway going through the <span class="dlf">hole</span>, the <span class="dlf">fence</span> collapsed from the heaviness of the...of the...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me, and that time I thought this is the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="3676">But actually, this saved me. </sentence><sentence id="3677">Because the first few went through I could see why the people is depending on me. </sentence><sentence id="3678">The <span class="dlf">mines</span> exploding and <span class="spatial object">bodies</span> flowing there. </sentence><sentence id="3679">And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part of the <span class="dlf">fence</span> and I can't go out...from ...from the <span class="dlf">fence</span> because the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> did go in in the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="3680">So I left my coat. </sentence><sentence id="3681">By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute from the <span class="interior space">storeroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3682">It was also maybe lucky because the...the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> wasn't able to go in too deep to the...my shirt or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and start to run. </sentence><sentence id="3684">I fall down a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3685">I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3686">I start to run until I reached the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3687">Now, I'll really speed up. </sentence><sentence id="3688">Come to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3689">We are wandering about the day, the next day we come to a point and we under...I already understood that it's not good to run there. </sentence><sentence id="3690">We are about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="3691">The next day we met another 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="3692">So, and I've seen  0 that we are too many and must...something must be done. </sentence><sentence id="3693">But...uh...we still kept together until one...until early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="3694">I remember we stopped out of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and Sasha said that we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. </sentence><sentence id="3695">So whoever had the money to give money to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And all the men with rifles did left. </sentence><sentence id="3697">Nine people with weapons left. </sentence><sentence id="3698">We were against it. </sentence><sentence id="3699">We understood that something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3700">Only Shlomo Szmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with arifle left. </sentence><sentence id="3701">And he promised he will come back. </sentence><sentence id="3702">He did never come back. </sentence><sentence id="3703">I talked with him later after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3704">Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. </sentence><sentence id="3705">He said when I met him that this was his soldier duty to go back to...to the army. </sentence><sentence id="3706">Anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3707">So when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. </sentence><sentence id="3708">The weak people did want to go with the strong ones. </sentence><sentence id="3709">And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I won't even to go in it. </sentence><sentence id="3710">Finally, I took two boys and we left. </sentence><sentence id="3711">Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel Weitzen], who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick. </sentence><sentence id="3712">We eluded the guards. </sentence><sentence id="3713">We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, <span class="populated place">Izbica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3714">Over there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us. </sentence><sentence id="3715">The two boys didn't want to go into the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3716">They were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3717">But I left to the <span class="populated place">town</span> in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="3718">It was sort of dark. </sentence><sentence id="3719">I come to the Polish lady. </sentence><sentence id="3720">She didn't want to hide me. </sentence><sentence id="3721">So I left back and told the guys, "Listen, it's no way. </sentence><sentence id="3722">We must look for another place. </sentence><sentence id="3723">But you know what? </sentence><sentence id="3724">Let go first eat. </sentence><sentence id="3725">We're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3726">Come." </sentence><sentence id="3727">Not far, we have seen light from a little <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3728">And we go to this <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3729">We were afraid to go in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3730">But these were <span class="dlf">farms</span>..were little <span class="dlf">farms</span>...little <span class="building">houses</span> ... uh...single <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3731">So we were not as...not as scared so much. </sentence><sentence id="3732">We went into this little <span class="building">house</span>, little <span class="dlf">farm</span>, we have seen from the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3733">We come. </sentence><sentence id="3734">There's light. </sentence><sentence id="3735">We go into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3736">There's food on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, but no people. </sentence><sentence id="3737">We call...I call, "Farmer, Farmer." </sentence><sentence id="3738">In Polish: "<span class="building">Dzier_awca</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3739">Nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="3740">Finally, we go back to this <span class="interior space">room</span> and start to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3741">We go back out again and finally, I see a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="3742">We asked him, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="3743">Come here. </sentence><sentence id="3744">Where your father?" </sentence><sentence id="3745">And he comes. </sentence><sentence id="3746">He recognized we are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And he said, "Oh, my father and mother are scared. </sentence><sentence id="3748">They thought you are...you are bandits. </sentence><sentence id="3749">And they're robbing so much here." </sentence><sentence id="3750">So he called the parents. </sentence><sentence id="3751">The parents did come down with his sister. </sentence><sentence id="3752">I recognized his sister. </sentence><sentence id="3753">I used to go to <span class="building">school</span> with mine... with...with me. </sentence><sentence id="3754">And the atmosphere start to get warm, and later I told him, "Listen, Mr. Bojarski, what would you take to hide us? </sentence><sentence id="3755">You are far away from the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3756">Close to the <span class="env

" </sentence><sentence id="3761">I will think about it. </sentence><sentence id="3762">Go back to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3763">To make it short, in a couple of days he agreed to hide me. </sentence><sentence id="3764">We did put in so much gold and diamonds, and he was excited. </sentence><sentence id="3765">His wife took a ring. </sentence><sentence id="3766">His daughter, earrings. " </sentence><sentence id="3767">Take it. </sentence><sentence id="3768">Keep it. </sentence><sentence id="3769">Fine." </sentence><sentence id="3770">He built a hiding place in the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3771">In the <span class="interior space">corner</span> in the <span class="building">barn</span>, he put in a <span class="spatial object">table</span>, covered it with a lot of straw. </sentence><sentence id="3772">From outside, you had a <span class="spatial object">panel</span> which he opened to give us food. ( </sentence><sentence id="3773">Sigh) Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3774">We were...I will skip also my adventures in  1 this hiding place and the way I did try to go out because I recognize it's late. </sentence><sentence id="3775">And I will go to a point where once in the nighttime, we hear some...the dog barking. </sentence><sentence id="3776">People screaming. </sentence><sentence id="3777">Finally, we heard people coming in in the <span class="building">barn</span> and yelling to him, "Tell me, where do you have the Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="3778">Show me the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="3779">And he...we recognized the voice of the farmer, "There's no Jews here. </sentence><sentence id="3780">No, there're no Jews." " </sentence><sentence id="3781">Yes, we know there're Jews." " </sentence><sentence id="3782">No, there're no." " </sentence><sentence id="3783">So tell me...where do you have...so nice, from where do you have so nice clothing?You go to <span class="building">church</span> nicely dressed, and your wife..." Well, I understood. </sentence><sentence id="3784">We were so happy that he didn't drink. </sentence><sentence id="3785">Because a lot of Poles are drinking. </sentence><sentence id="3786">He didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3787">But what he has done, he Hoved nice] clothing always. </sentence><sentence id="3788">Shoes for his sons, pants, sweaters; so this was noticible. </sentence><sentence id="3789">So anyway, and they start to look for us in the <span class="dlf">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3790">They didn't find us and they left. </sentence><sentence id="3791">After they left he did come in in the <span class="region">hiding place</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="3792">You see what's happened? </sentence><sentence id="3793">What would happen," he said, "he did discover you? </sentence><sentence id="3794">They would kill you. </sentence><sentence id="3795">They would kill me. </sentence><sentence id="3796">And the worse is that...what a shame would be to my family when they...they did find out that we're hiding Jews." </sentence><sentence id="3797">Now I...I didn't have formal education, as I said, but I did read a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3798">And he had a big <span class="spatial object">cross</span> on..on his chest and asked him, "Mr. Bojarski, why are you ashamed? </sentence><sentence id="3799">Why...why should your family...should family be ashamed? </sentence><sentence id="3800">You know Jesus Christ was a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="3801">For him it was the biggest insult. </sentence><sentence id="3802">To accuse Jesus Christ of being a Jew! </sentence><sentence id="3803">And probably when I told him...on top of it, I told him the picture, "Last Supper," he has in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>: All 12 apostles are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3804">And the...it was that a insult to him that I accused the apostles being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3805">Anyway, he went out mad. </sentence><sentence id="3806">Couple of days later he comes, "Guys, I have for you guys a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="3807">Because I find out that the Germans will search for Jews in any <span class="dlf">farm</span> which is close to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3808">So only for 3 days I made another hiding place." </sentence><sentence id="3809">And one evening, he did come. </sentence><sentence id="3810">He told us to go out. </sentence><sentence id="3811">And I expected hiding place if he's so afraid he will do it, he will make it some place far away from him in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="3812">But he made it right out behind the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3813">It was already suspicious, but I still didn't suspect. </sentence><sentence id="3814">We didn't remember he.... When I went behind the <span class="building">barn</span>, I noticed ...uh...a little <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> with two wheels. </sentence><sentence id="3815"><span class="spatial object">Two wheel carriage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3816">No? </sentence><sentence id="3817">Like a <span class="spatial object">platform</span> with two handles. </sentence><sentence id="3818">On top of it was a big <span class="spatial object">millstone</span>, a stone we'd make flour with it, in the old type <span class="building">mills</span> they have grinding stones. </sentence><sentence id="3819">Anyway, a big stone. </sentence><sentence id="3820">I didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="3821">It was standing.... Later, I connected it. </sentence><sentence id="3822">Now, he picked me up here by mine waist and pushed me in that <span class="dlf">hole</span>, and later he pushed in another one and later we did ask him for a kerosene lamp which he did give us. </sentence><sentence id="3823">Put in...have the kerosene and looking. </sentence><sentence id="3824">We're were in a <span class="dlf">hole</span> about a meter and a half, a square meter and a half. </sentence><sentence id="3825">The <span class="interior space">roof</span> was...I've seen it from inside, a 2 by 4 long and across were <span class="env feature">pine branches</span> and some straw. </sentence><sentence id="3826">The <span class="dlf">opening</span> was a round opening maybe a square foot, a foot round or maybe a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="3827">We barely squeezed in. </sentence><sentence id="3828">Was now pushed in <span class="env feature">straw</span> on it. </sentence><sentence id="3829">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="3830">We are sitting inside and later we hear and that they're pushing something hard and something fall...very heavy on top of the <span class="dlf">hiding place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3831">And what's happened, the <span class="dlf">2 by 4</span> break down like a letter V.
