<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Will you please tell me your name and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Renee Fritz, and I was born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Can you tell us your first memories of your childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My first memories of my childhood were I remember leaving <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> when I was around 2 years old and I remember my mother carrying me all the way. ( </sentence><sentence id="10">laugh) Always having to, you know, carry me because I was, you know, a real little one and we had... It was really a lot of walking, no other source of <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>, and that's basically you know what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Do you recall what happened... Of course, you were very young then... when the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: I... The only thing that I basically remember as far as that was that my mother carried like a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> along with her and as we went along, I remember she periodically had to open that <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> and give away certain, you know, articles like a little...she had a brown <span class="spatial object">handbag</span>...and when she gave that away it meant having another meal. </sentence><sentence id="16">And I remember she took with her jewelry and every time she had a piece of jewelry to give away that...and when I saw her giving it away it mean that, you know, we were going to have a little bit more food to get us through to the next trip and the next meal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: You were separated from your mother at a young age. </sentence><sentence id="20">Can you tell us about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh, when we reached <span class="country">Belgium</span>, uh, I was separated from her and, uh, through the..the <span class="interior space">underground</span> really did all that. </sentence><sentence id="25">We had moved into a...into a <span class="interior space">room</span> where this woman who belonged to the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> and she got a hold of the priest who then in turn worked with the underground and I was taken to a <span class="building">convent</span> at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What happened before you separated from your mother? </sentence><sentence id="30">Where did your mother take you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Uh, Before I separated from my mother what we did is we went to a...from <span class="country">Austria</span> we...most of it was really again through walking or sometimes a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> would pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="34">And we went to <span class="populated place">Calais</span>, <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">And in <span class="populated place">Calais</span>, we were all--I do remember, we were put in <span class="building">jail</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="36">And, uh, somehow we got out of there. </sentence><sentence id="37">That..I..we..I don't know how we were able to get out, but we did get out and the march started again until we finally reached..uh..<span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">And once we..we got to <span class="country">Belgium</span> that is when, uh, people who were just taking us...in other words, the head of some of these groups were able to make various contacts; and that is how we got to this woman, Mrs. Degelas. </sentence><sentence id="39">And she then, in turn, contacted the...the priest. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: Tell us about <span class="building">Mrs. Degelas</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Mrs. Degelas was, uh... Well, to me, of course, she looked old. </sentence><sentence id="42">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, I would say...now that I recall, she was probably a woman in her 40s, who lived with her husband in a very nice...in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh... She seemed like a very lovely lady. </sentence><sentence id="45">She owned quite a large <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">I think the best way describe it would be here it would be like...it would like a <span class="building">townhouse</span>, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="47">And this <span class="building">townhouse</span> was divided into separate <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and she gave us...Now when I say us, that means there were 30 of us. </sentence><sentence id="48">She let us utilize that <span class="interior space">room</span> as long as we had a need for it and, uh, the only problem was that I could not stay with my mother at that point because number 1, I was a child and number 2, my mother also had to take care of my grandparents who were with her and in the <span class="interior space">room</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="49">But I think what they were afraid of more than anything was the noise level because I didn't have a full understanding of..that a war was on or what the idea of all this was. </sentence><sentence id="50">I mean I knew no other life, so this was just part of, you know, everyday living. </sentence><sentence id="51">And, uh, when they told me that I had to, you know, go away for awhile, well, I just...1 just went. ( </sentence><sentence id="52">laughter) I didn't have any choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Where did you go from here and what are your recollections? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: From..uh..uh.. there I was put into a...into a <span class="building">convent</span> which was also located in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, and some man came and picked me up that I had never seen before. </sentence><sentence id="69">That scared me slightly. </sentence><sentence id="70">And he told me on the way that the reason for all the things that were going on was because I was Jewish which, of course, didn't mean anything to me. </sentence><sentence id="71">I was just too young to understand what Jewish meant. </sentence><sentence id="72">But that I was going to go and live in...in a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">And when I got there..uh.. I saw nuns which scared me a little bit because in <span class="country">Europe</span>, of course, not like today, the nuns were all in habits and it was a very, very strict order. </sentence><sentence id="74">And he took me to the Mother Superior and the Mother Superior tried to explain as much as she felt I could understand that I was going to be into <span class="building">school</span> and that I was going to be living with other children there during the day. </sentence><sentence id="75">However, those children leave at the end of the day and I was going to be taken care of by the nuns. </sentence><sentence id="76">I was also told that I was going to be taught religion and that my name would be changed to Susanne Ledon, and this was name that I would...that I can only answer by. </sentence><sentence id="77">I have to forget my other name, that there was no more name like that because this was going to be something totally new and I just have to follow these rules. </sentence><sentence id="78">So L...I did. </sentence><sentence id="79">And she handed me some medals and with a safety pin and she told me every time that I memorized what each metal meant that I would get a new one. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="81">I started memorizing different..uh..prayers for medals and she gave me a rosary and she taught me how to do the rosary and this went on for periods of time. </sentence><sentence id="82">Uh, I think the most frightening part of the experience was the evenings because I was taken to what seemed like a <span class="building">dormitory</span> that had miles upon miles of just <span class="interior space">corridors</span> and they were just all <span class="dlf">partitions</span> in between and I was put into one of these <span class="dlf">partitions</span> that had a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, a <span class="spatial object">sink</span>, and a huge <span class="spatial object">crucifix</span> and one of the nuns was..was in charge, and I was left in this <span class="building">dormitory</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="83">That was rather scary. </sentence><sentence id="84">And, uh, I would just say in my prayers. ( </sentence><sentence id="85">crying) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Can you recall for us some of the things you did from day to day in the <span class="building">convent</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: Uh, well during the days...on some days when they felt it was safe, I would go to a <span class="building">class</span> with the rest of the children but (crying, crying, crying) I'm sorry... Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="107">I don't mean to do this. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Just relax. </sentence><sentence id="109">Take a drink. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: I didn't mean to do this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: It's alright. </sentence><sentence id="115">Take as much time as you need. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Am I holding you up? </sentence><sentence id="119">Oh, God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: We're here for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: I swore I wouldn't do this. ( </sentence><sentence id="125">Crying) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: You don't know what to expect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: I know, it's just as... I hope they stopped the <span class="spatial object">cameras</span> from rolling. </sentence><sentence id="131">There goes the mascara. </sentence><sentence id="132">I'm okay. </sentence><sentence id="133">I'll be fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: You were tell me about the day-to-day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="141">The day..day to day was...there were certain days I could go to <span class="building">school</span>, uh, for maybe an hour or 2 and that was just to get me to mingle with the other children, but the problem was that they would start questioning me and there was always a nun that had to stay by me because they were always so afraid that I would say the wrong thing because if I did, I mean, everyone in that <span class="building">convent</span> would have been exposed. </sentence><sentence id="142">There might have been other Jewish children in the <span class="building">convent</span>, but, of course, I was not aware of it because I was always by myself. </sentence><sentence id="143">I did know that these children did come..uh.. in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="144">They did leave at night and I was left. </sentence><sentence id="145">The minute that they left the nun would actually take me with her and I would go and, uh, to the <span class="building">chapel</span> and again we would go through the religious..the religious end of it so that I would know catholicism backwards and forwards and this was the main training that I got. </sentence><sentence id="146">The actual schooling part of it was not because I could never stay long enough in a <span class="interior space">classroom</span> to pick anything up, but the religious aspect, because religion was going to save my life basically. </sentence><sentence id="147">I mean, this was obviously what they, you know, tried to do. </sentence><sentence id="148">And, uh, in case the Germans did come..and a lot of times, Germans did come over. </sentence><sentence id="149">I remember seeing them come into the <span class="building">convent</span> and be talking to the Mother Superior. </sentence><sentence id="150">So, this is really what, you know, day-to-day life was like. </sentence><sentence id="151">Uh, once in a while we went out and, you know, walked around some of the <span class="dlf">gardens</span> and so forth, but I would say basically I was, you know, <span class="interior space">indoors</span> and really kept busy religiously. </sentence><sentence id="152">That was the main thing that I really understand catholicism more than anything and, uh, the...of course, the incentive always was the more I knew about it, and I would get another medal. </sentence><sentence id="153">I mean by the time I left the <span class="building">convent</span>, I had a safety pin that was...had so many medals on it. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was wonderful. ( </sentence><sentence id="155">laughter) I thought that was great. </sentence><sentence id="156"> So, you know, it was a great incentive to me to keep going and I did that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: You mentioned one nun that was sort of assigned to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: Can you recall something about her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: I just recall what she looked like. </sentence><sentence id="181">She was a very tall, very masculine type of a woman. </sentence><sentence id="182">She never smiled, and I always...I was scared silly of her. </sentence><sentence id="183">That I will tell you. </sentence><sentence id="184">I felt I was...Well, now I feel I was probably, you know, quite a burden on her. </sentence><sentence id="185">But I was really really afraid of her and I think what scared me the most was at night when she...she would just take me over to this little <span class="interior space">cubicle</span> and she'd say, "Now get down on your knees and let me hear your prayers." </sentence><sentence id="186">And then she would just turn around and leave and then all the lights were shut off, and I was left completely in the dark there. </sentence><sentence id="187">And that...that really scared me. </sentence><sentence id="188">That I found very scary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: How long were you in the <span class="building">convent</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: I believe I was in the <span class="building">convent</span> for almost 2 years because periodically, uh, I...after the <span class="building">convent</span>, I went...[ remember when I had to leave the <span class="building">convent</span> which happened one day....came very sudden..uh..that a strange person picked me up and they told me that I would have to leave, that this was not a good place for me anymore. </sentence><sentence id="201">What I found out later on was, of course, the Germans became aware that the nuns were hiding..uh..Jewish children and their safety was becoming a problem, so they felt that they couldn't jeopardize their whole...the whole <span class="building">school system</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="202">And they had..they just had a get me so they contacted the <span class="interior space">underground</span> which..uh..worked with the priests and they felt that I just have to leave, and I just left there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Did you see your mother before you left the <span class="building">convent</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="209">I did. </sentence><sentence id="210">I saw her once, uh, for like a day. </sentence><sentence id="211">I never stayed overnight. </sentence><sentence id="212">I was never able to stay with her. </sentence><sentence id="213">I just saw her for like a day and then I had to leave right away again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Where was she? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: My mother was still living in..at <span class="building">home</span> with this Mrs. Degelas and her whole family. </sentence><sentence id="223">The only thing that had happened there was that her parents were very ill. </sentence><sentence id="224">And my grandfather took my grandmother to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="225">And while my grandmother was inside with the doctor, the Gestapo picked him up on the <span class="dlf">street</span>; because he was a very, uh...he was a real orthodox Jew and he had a beard and everything. </sentence><sentence id="226">And they...they just picked him up, and he was never to be seen from or heard from again. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the doctor somehow got my grandmother.... I don't know how this happened, but somehow got my grandmother..uh..someplace. </sentence><sentence id="228">And uh...but that was the end of my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="229">That was it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Now this person came to get you from the <span class="building">convent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">What are your recollections after that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well, after they came and got me from the <span class="building">convent</span> I went to, uh, out in the <span class="region">countryside</span> and I was taken to a <span class="dlf">farm</span> which was...which was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="233">I just loved the <span class="dlf">farm</span> because I was with a private family who had a daughter who was, I would say, about 3 or 4 years older than I and, uh, they had the grandmother live there and this was really... My fondest recollections, you know, of the war was really the happiest there, was just a big <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and it was just really wonderful except that now I became a Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="234">They told me I was no longer a Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="235">So now I was taught how to be a Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="236">Uh, This...this was fine. </sentence><sentence id="237">I mean, it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="238">I mean that...it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="239">It was just another learning experience, I guess, you know, learning something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What did you have to learn in terms of becoming a Protestant and how did that make you feel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Well, they...they took away some of the metals and...they took away the rosary. </sentence><sentence id="251">That's the first thing they did. </sentence><sentence id="252">They took away the rosary beads, and..uh..I was not too happy to let go of that. </sentence><sentence id="253">Uh, but they told me I had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="254">So I just, you know, I just did it. </sentence><sentence id="255">You just don't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="256">You do what you're told. </sentence><sentence id="257">And I wanted to stay there so bad. </sentence><sentence id="258">I really wanted to stay that I would have done anything there just because I was really really happy living on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, but unfortunately that was my shortest stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Can you tell me the name of the family? </sentence><sentence id="269">Did you keep your same name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: I kept my Susanne Ledon, which was my name all during the war. </sentence><sentence id="273">Uh, I do not remember their last names. </sentence><sentence id="274">Their daughter's name was Jeanine. </sentence><sentence id="275">That I do know, and, uh, that was about, you know, all I could really remember from that that except it was a great...it was just happy there, but I didn't stay very long. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: What happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: After that, uh, I think the most...I think the most traumatic thing that happened there was that I was woken up in the middle of the night and..uh..it was rather frightening and a strange man came and Jeanine's mother said, "You have to get dressed now because you have to go with this man." </sentence><sentence id="283">And I do remember I was very, very upset about that. </sentence><sentence id="284">I didn't want to go, but she gave my <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> or whatever and she told me that I had to leave and she hoped that she'd see me again someday, but I must be good. </sentence><sentence id="285">That I remember her saying to me. </sentence><sentence id="286">And, uh, we took around midnight a long <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride, and I remember getting to a <span class="building">home</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="287">It was like a very large <span class="building">house</span>, and there were lots and lots of children, and he took me to an <span class="building">orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">And, uh, I would say there were about 300 of us in the <span class="building">orphanage</span> and I know there were a couple of adults taking care of us, and we ranged from about the age of 4 to about 18. </sentence><sentence id="289">That's where the older took care of the younger, and the only good part of it was that I was able to remain a Protestant there. </sentence><sentence id="290">I didn't have to learn another religion. </sentence><sentence id="291"> They... However, we had... 1 do remember one thing though that I had outgrown all my shoes and, uh, I remembered that. </sentence><sentence id="292">After I...well, this was at the <span class="dlf">farm</span> already, I only wore wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="293">I do remember that distinctly and, uh, that...1 don't know why that made an impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="294">But..uh. </sentence><sentence id="295">that's what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Can you tell me about your day-to-day life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Uh, day-to-day life was really...we lived...there were, I would say, maybe about 10 to 15 <span class="interior space">rooms</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="313">We crowded into any <span class="interior space">room</span> where we found a <span class="interior space">space</span>, but most of the living was done underground. </sentence><sentence id="314">Because there were loads and loads of <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>, uh, underneath, and..uh..we were shown how when air raids came, ..uh.. how to survive on our own, what we had to do, what kind of procedures because we really had to know how..how to do this alone because nobody could really do it for us. </sentence><sentence id="315">Like I said, there were only 2 adults there with us. </sentence><sentence id="316">Food was extremely, extremely scarce. </sentence><sentence id="317">If you had a slice of bread a day, that was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="318">You sort of hoarded it to last, you know, for the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="319">Uh, you really...it was really a survival of the fittest there. </sentence><sentence id="320">Whatever you did, that's how you survived. </sentence><sentence id="321">I remember getting very ill, and you just...well, you just..you just got better. </sentence><sentence id="322">I mean that was it. </sentence><sentence id="323">I remember getting caught outside in an air raid. </sentence><sentence id="324">I wasn't <span class="interior space">room</span> enough to get...there wasn't... wasn't fast enough to get in the <span class="building">shelter</span>, because in order to go into the <span class="building">underground shelter</span> you had to go out of the <span class="building">house</span> and go in there, go into the <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">And most of the time it was always very, very dark because directly across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from us were <span class="building">German headquarters</span> and we didn't want to arouse too much suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="326">I mean they knew this was an <span class="building">orphanage</span>, but I am sure that they never thought there would be Jewish children hidden right under their noses. </sentence><sentence id="327">Uh.. I don't know if all of us were Jewish though or not. </sentence><sentence id="328">There was very little...there was no communication amongst any of us. </sentence><sentence id="329">I mean there was no play time. </sentence><sentence id="330">There was none of that. </sentence><sentence id="331">It was just you live from hour to hour. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: What did you know of the people who ran the <span class="building">orphanage</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="356">I really knew absolutely nothing about them. </sentence><sentence id="357">They were two women, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="358">And...like I said the olders...the older children would take care of the younger ones. </sentence><sentence id="359">But, uh, we just...you know, we just went along. </sentence><sentence id="360">I mean, we did...the only thing that we really did do is go to <span class="building">church</span> a lot. </sentence><sentence id="361">That we did do. </sentence><sentence id="362">But, uh, otherwise there was...there was really, you know, nothing to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Was there any contact with your mother during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Just once. </sentence><sentence id="374">There was one more contact with my mother where I did see her for a day and then I went right back again and I could not, you know... Of course, I didn't know the name of the place where I was. </sentence><sentence id="375">I was told nothing. </sentence><sentence id="376">I didn't even know the <span class="populated place">town</span> I was in. </sentence><sentence id="377">I was told absolutely nothing so that then I was not able to repeat to her anything. </sentence><sentence id="378">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="379">And, uh, uh, you know, she...I...1 do remember her sort of very upset because she thought...L..I remember she thought I didn't look very clean and I, uh, I had..I had scabs all over my head because we all had lice. </sentence><sentence id="380">We were all pretty sick in that place, but we all...we  all managed.

( </sentence><sentence id="900">laugh) So they all started paying a lot of attention to me because of it. </sentence><sentence id="901">But they...that didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="902">They didn't know how they were going to do this with me through <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="903">So they devised a plan that every day I would spend a half hour in first grade, a half hour in second grade, a half hour in third grade. </sentence><sentence id="904">Well, it was a little humiliating because here I am with these 7 and 8 years and I am almost 13, but there was no other way to get me caught up. </sentence><sentence id="905">I did do it. </sentence><sentence id="906">Uh, I didn't do it the first year, but they did get me through 8th grade enough so that I could read enough so that I could write. </sentence><sentence id="907">Math, I knew the multiplication tables and I could do some addition and some subtraction. </sentence><sentence id="908">Math is still not my subject (laugh), but I got through. </sentence><sentence id="909">And I also got Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah, because I had to; and I did read the HafTorah in Hebrew, because I had to. </sentence><sentence id="910">And the other thing is that I wanted to be like the rest of the children. </sentence><sentence id="911">I was 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="912">And it's very, very difficult when you're going into <span class="building">high school</span> to be different; and I wanted to be like the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="913">And (sigh), it meant...I remember buying sheet music and standing in front of a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> and practicing how to lose this accent and I practiced so hard. </sentence><sentence id="914">I really worked at it. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I made some friends. </sentence><sentence id="916">The friends that I did make though were... | would always seek out the ones that scholastically were way up there, because those were the ones I wanted to be like. </sentence><sentence id="917">And when I went to <span class="building">high school</span>, they only...there were only two courses given. </sentence><sentence id="918">One was a <span class="building">college level course</span>; and the other one was a <span class="building">business course</span>. </sentence><sentence id="919">But the kids I wanted to be with were the college level kids. </sentence><sentence id="920">So I made up my mind I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="921">I'm going to go to <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="922">Which it was quite a struggle. </sentence><sentence id="923">The only thing that I did do was, the...the uh teachers were sympathetic to me and they did work with me for many, many hours. </sentence><sentence id="924">And like I say, I practiced really, really hard. </sentence><sentence id="925">I took some courses that were easy for me. </sentence><sentence id="926">Like I took French, which was wonderful; and I became President of the French class which was (laugh)... That the best thing that happened to me all through <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="927">Uh, I did join the choir; and at Christmas time, of course, I could sing all the Christmas carols. </sentence><sentence id="928">Because in <span class="country">Europe</span> the tunes were the same, only the (laugh) language was different. </sentence><sentence id="929">But I could sing it in Latin, and they couldn't sing it in Latin. </sentence><sentence id="930">So, you know, I excelled in that. </sentence><sentence id="931">Uh, [had a lot of...the kids that...a lot of them that I was friendly with, uh they were...a lot of them were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="932">And I would go to confession with them, and I knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="933">So that way, it was great to have had that background in other religions. </sentence><sentence id="934">I mean, it was really my own religion that I knew the least about. </sentence><sentence id="935">But I was getting...you know, I was Bar [NB: Bat] Mitzvah anyway, so it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="936">And, uh, but the Jewish families, like I said, they lived on the other side of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="937">And this I could not...those are the ones I would have liked to have kept up with, but I just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="938">And uh...so I felt the only way to do this was then to uh...to go with the kids that were...did excel in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">The ones that were the cheerleaders and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="940">And uh... As a matter of fact, in 8th grade, I remember they even made me Captain of the cheerleaders, which was a great boost to my morale. </sentence><sentence id="941">So they  5 did...you know, they did try; but I think one of the most difficult thing is you want to be like your peers. </sentence><sentence id="942">And it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="943">It was really so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="944">And losing that accent, which I wanted to in the worst way! </sentence><sentence id="945">Well, I finally did; but with a lot of, a lot of practice. </sentence><sentence id="946">And I got to my senior year of <span class="building">high school</span> and, of course, I was taking a college bound course. </sentence><sentence id="947">Which... I mean, they just let me do it. </sentence><sentence id="948">They didn't know how I was going to achieve that. </sentence><sentence id="949">And I made up my mind I wanted to go on to <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">And the principal of the <span class="building">high school</span> called me down. </sentence><sentence id="951">And he said, "You are trying to do the impossible." </sentence><sentence id="952">He says, "You'll never..." He says, "You...you just can't do this." </sentence><sentence id="953">He says, "You can't go to a..to a <span class="building">4 year school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="954">And I says, "Well, I'm going to." </sentence><sentence id="955">My SATs were disgusting. </sentence><sentence id="956">They were just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="957">So I told him I had to go to <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="958">And he went ahead and he wrote letters to the presidents of the different <span class="building">colleges</span> that I wanted to go to; because I had made up my mind that the first <span class="building">school</span> I wanted to go to was <span class="building">Boston University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="959">The second one was <span class="building">University of Connecticut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="960">And as a fallback, I would go to a <span class="building">two year school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="961">But that was a real fallback. </sentence><sentence id="962">And (cough) I had in the interim become friendly with one gal who belonged to the <span class="building">Temple</span> with us.... "Well, if she can go to <span class="building">Boston University</span> maybe that's where I'll go." </sentence><sentence id="963">I wanted to be so much like the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="964">But it was one of the most difficult things to do. </sentence><sentence id="965">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="966">He wrote; and they told him that they would consider my coming up and taking an interview, because the written part I couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="967">I mean, half the things I was reading, I didn't even know what I was reading because the vocabulary. </sentence><sentence id="968">I...I just didn't have any vocabulary. </sentence><sentence id="969">And they all granted me interviews. </sentence><sentence id="970">And (pause) the...I remember going up to <span class="populated place">Boston</span>, getting on a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and going; because my...neither one of my parents ever saw the inside of a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="971">I mean, I just went. </sentence><sentence id="972">I did. </sentence><sentence id="973">I mean, even when they had meetings and things like that, they couldn't communicate. </sentence><sentence id="974">Plus they had their own...their own problems. </sentence><sentence id="975">And I always sort of took care of myself. </sentence><sentence id="976">And I think they always figured as long as I had a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over my head and food on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>... I mean, what else did I need? </sentence><sentence id="977">So L...I really L..you know, I made my own way. </sentence><sentence id="978">I took a <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">I went to <span class="populated place">Boston</span>. </sentence><sentence id="980">I had my interview, and I remember sitting near begging them, please, to let me in. </sentence><sentence id="981">Uh, frankly, I think they let me in cause they felt sorry for me. </sentence><sentence id="982">I really do. </sentence><sentence id="983">Because I don't know how they could take a chance on this. </sentence><sentence id="984">Uh, they did. </sentence><sentence id="985">They...
