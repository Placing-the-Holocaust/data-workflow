for further information about this collection Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 7 November 29, 2012 know when you grow up in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, it is different like in the <span class="populated place">city</span> because in the <span class="populated place">village</span> you don't have -- well we did have burglars, they burgled our <span class="building">store</span> but I wasn't afraid. </sentence><sentence id="157">First of all there was maybe one or two <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and one of them was when our doctor from the next <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">And he came through the <span class="populated place">village</span> like a crazy guy so you'd say go away, go away quickly because the gonzerit [ph] is coming. </sentence><sentence id="159">You know even the chickens and the geese were running away on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">You know in front of our <span class="building">house</span> was a <span class="env feature">pond</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And as children we would go swimming there. </sentence><sentence id="162">Nobody taught us. </sentence><sentence id="163">We just went in the <span class="env feature">water</span> and started first with one leg down and then we just lifted the other leg and that's how we were swimming. </sentence><sentence id="164">And in winter it froze over and we would be skating on it. </sentence><sentence id="165">But I was, I didn't have a really proper <span class="spatial object">skate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">My mother had a pair of <span class="spatial object">skates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">Can you imagine from the turn of the century. </sentence><sentence id="168">They were iron skates and you attached them to your shoes you know like you had a key and you had to turn it. </sentence><sentence id="169">And I would put them on in front of our <span class="building">house</span> and by the time I was at the <span class="env feature">pond</span> I lost them about three times. </sentence><sentence id="170">But my brother, he was very good at it and he won the special skate and he told my mother you buy me, Kanotski [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="171">And these are already good <span class="spatial object">skates</span> and they had little, like little teeth in the front. </sentence><sentence id="172">And as a matter of fact one day he fell into the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">Because we had <span class="building">inns</span> and the <span class="building">inns</span> would take the ice from the <span class="env feature">pond</span>, from the summer so that the beer would be cold in their <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">And overnight it would freeze over and let's say there was a little snow so you couldn't tell where they took out the snow, the ice. </sentence><sentence id="175">And one day my brother crossed the <span class="env feature">pond</span> and he fell in and we were standing in the <span class="dlf">window</span>, my mother and I. We were absolutely going crazy because you could see him going up and down and up and down. </sentence><sentence id="176">And then a young man came and he lie down on the <span class="env feature">ice</span> and he rescued him but he had pneumonia and pleurisy because he was in that icy <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the <span class="populated place">town</span> or among your friends. </sentence><sentence id="216">You said you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="218">Because you have to understand that we didn't have a radio because we didn't have electricity. </sentence><sentence id="219">So nobody had radios. </sentence><sentence id="220">My mother I think was the only person who got a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="221">So they really didn't know what was going on around them. </sentence><sentence id="222">And with a German speaking <span class="populated place">village</span>, the people lived there probably I don't know 300 years, 400 years something like that. </sentence><sentence id="223"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>

standing always in silence. </sentence><sentence id="1552">They moved us around and we moved around because we wanted to be with certain girls and we didn't want to be divided and so on.

saw that there were not only SS men but soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1560">But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> because nobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen. </sentence><sentence id="1561">So they put us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Just the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1563">But we stopped quite often because there were air raids

full of corpses. </sentence><sentence id="1870">And they made us drag those corpses to a <span class="interior space">mass grave</span> because they wanted you know, they knew that they had to, that

nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1873">You know, you know that it's goes on, this is what you're going to be like and you fight on. </sentence><sentence id="1874">And then the Germans ran away. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And they didn't give us anything to eat either. </sentence><sentence id="1877">So we went,

a funny thing. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I'm the only one who remembers that. </sentence><sentence id="1883">When you will read anything about <span class="building">Tiesstack</span> they don't talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Anyway and then they left. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And then there was no one. </sentence><sentence id="1886">There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And they were (sound skip) including myself and we felt that <span class="building">Red

went into -- she had a blouse with a, with a <span class="spatial object">pad</span> and it went into the <span class="spatial object">pad</span>, but nothing happened to her and as we were standing there a huge <span class="spatial object">tank</span> arrived with a white star. </sentence><sentence id="1894">Who the hell knew what it was? </sentence><sentence id="1895">You know we have no idea what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And then the <span class="spatial object">turret</span> opened and there was this young man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us. </sentence><sentence id="1897">He said it in German. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [German expression -- ph] he said and they started driving in and the soldiers came

</sentence><sentence id="1901">Because Roosevelt died on the 12"" and we were liberated on the 15". </sentence><sentence id="1902">And I like an idiot was crying. </sentence><sentence id="1903">I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So now when I give a lecture, I tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr.Roosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn't do anything so that's why I'm ashamed of my tears. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Anyway so this British army came in. </sentence><sentence id="1906">This was the first <span class="populated place">camp</span> they liberated and they saw the horror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And they got in touch with their <span class="building">head office</span> and the first thing they did, they put up <span class="spatial object">showers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1908">So at least we could get washed. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And there was a <span class="populated place">town</span> not far from where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1910">It was called <span class="populated
