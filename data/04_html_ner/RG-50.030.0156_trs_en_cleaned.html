<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you state your name and birth date please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. </sentence><sentence id="7">My father will tell his own story. </sentence><sentence id="8">My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people. </sentence><sentence id="9">As I said, I was born in a little <span class="dlf">farm</span> there which they had rented. </sentence><sentence id="10">And while they were living in <span class="populated place">community</span> there, they got to...into contact with another <span class="populated place">community</span> which started in <span class="country">Germany</span> 1920. </sentence><sentence id="11">I want to give a brief history of this <span class="populated place">community</span> because it's important. </sentence><sentence id="12">Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in <span class="country">Africa</span>, sent there by the Amold family from <span class="region">North America</span> had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time. </sentence><sentence id="13">And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace. </sentence><sentence id="14">He started in <span class="country">Germany</span> 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. </sentence><sentence id="15">So he got into contact with my parents on the little <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> near <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but rejected it. </sentence><sentence id="17">He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work. </sentence><sentence id="18">And on this <span class="dlf">farm</span> they were milking cows, working in a <span class="building">cooperative</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="19">The <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> called <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span> heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to <span class="building">prison</span> for this in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and Everett visited my father in <span class="building">prison</span> and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">The problem was that in a <span class="populated place">socialist agnostic community</span> like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in <span class="populated place">community</span> it will break apart. </sentence><sentence id="21">The tensions are too great. </sentence><sentence id="22">So in this <span class="populated place">Swiss community</span>, they didn't find unity. </sentence><sentence id="23">The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members. </sentence><sentence id="24">Whereas in the <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span>, the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, there was a unity which was possible. </sentence><sentence id="25">You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big <span class="building">world churches</span>, the Catholics and the Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="26">Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">And my parents joined that <span class="populated place">community</span> in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="28">Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me. </sentence><sentence id="29">Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole <span class="populated place">community</span>, to the members, "Hitler has come to power. </sentence><sentence id="30">Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit? </sentence><sentence id="31">Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?And on this question, some left. </sentence><sentence id="32">My parents stayed. </sentence><sentence id="33">On...L...] had three other brothers born to  my family in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier. </sentence><sentence id="35">I do not remember any kind of persecution in <span class="country">Germany</span> itself, but I remember fear. </sentence><sentence id="36">Just fear. </sentence><sentence id="37">And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in <span class="country">Germany</span> about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies. </sentence><sentence id="39">The members of the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him." </sentence><sentence id="40">When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists. </sentence><sentence id="42">They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on. </sentence><sentence id="43">My father then was sent to take important documents to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> out of the reach of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to find out what they had in mind with us. </sentence><sentence id="45">Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the <span class="building">power structure</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">In <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, my father went to the <span class="building">headquarters</span> and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the <span class="region">Nazi state</span> shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the -- which accordins to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the  said, "Leave right away." </sentence><sentence id="47">But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad. </sentence><sentence id="48">There was some sick people. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. </sentence><sentence id="50">And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and they took us to a <span class="spatial object">train</span>...I believe in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">I think it was <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">And on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, then they took us to the <span class="dlf">Dutch boundary</span> and pushed us over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">I've often wondered why my father went to the...to <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span> for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the <span class="populated place">community</span> as because they figured we were enemies of the state. </sentence><sentence id="55">But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from <span class="region">North America</span>, they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us. </sentence><sentence id="56">Now I remember these two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="57">And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in <span class="country">Austria</span>, <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, <span class="region">Moravia</span>, which is today <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, began a life in <span class="populated place">community</span> like we live it today. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. </sentence><sentence id="59">By the Catholics, the Protestants, the <span class="building">churches</span> and the governments. </sentence><sentence id="60">They found refuge in <span class="region">Moravia</span> because hundred vears before this. _ </sentence><sentence id="61">there was a sniritual awakine and  any point with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="62">We did not raise an arm in salute. </sentence><sentence id="63">We did not go along with his politics. </sentence><sentence id="64">We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. </sentence><sentence id="65">We all...not I. | was a child. </sentence><sentence id="66">But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: How...how did it affect you at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: As I said, I was 5 years old. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was just afraid. </sentence><sentence id="134">That's all I know, and from...from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">At certain times, I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="136">And other times, I was a child growing up in this <span class="populated place">community</span> very much cared and loved for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the <span class="populated place">community</span> to your <span class="populated place">community</span> that caused this fear in you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Uh...L...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. </sentence><sentence id="145">And my father was away often for the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> finding refuge for the children. </sentence><sentence id="146">Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. </sentence><sentence id="147">His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child. </sentence><sentence id="148">This is...this is what I can say. </sentence><sentence id="149">But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was in...within the <span class="populated place">community</span>, it was protected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: How did the <span class="populated place">community</span> protect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: How did your <span class="populated place">community</span> live at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Our <span class="populated place">community</span> lived on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">I'm not quite sure how many <span class="env feature">acres</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">They were farming. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all <span class="populated place">city</span> people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="168">The <span class="env feature">land</span> was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">We lived in <span class="building">community houses</span> like the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> do today. </sentence><sentence id="170">We had our own <span class="building">school</span> and <span class="building">preschool</span> and <span class="building">kindergarten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community. </sentence><sentence id="172">So the influence from the outside was very low or nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Was the <span class="populated place">community</span> self sufficient? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: It was self sufficient up to a point. </sentence><sentence id="185">We took...the <span class="populated place">community</span> took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and <span class="building">lodging</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected. </sentence><sentence id="187">We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. </sentence><sentence id="188">Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically. </sentence><sentence id="189">How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. </sentence><sentence id="190">We farmed. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had <span class="building">wood tannery</span>, and we printed books. </sentence><sentence id="192">And the sale of books and <span class="building">tannery</span> was part of  the cash income, where as the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was the food. </sentence><sentence id="193">We...we never sold food. </sentence><sentence id="194">We always just grew food for our own use. </sentence><sentence id="195">And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="196">There was a time in <span class="country">Germany</span> when we had friends outside <span class="country">Germany</span> who gave us money, which was stuck in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">I forget what the term is. </sentence><sentence id="198">They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>, so friends gave us that money and the <span class="building">banks</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> would not give us the money. </sentence><sentence id="199">So they made our life more and more diffuclt. </sentence><sentence id="200">We took in children from broken <span class="building">homes</span> and needy situations, which the German government of the <span class="populated place">Weimer republic</span> had paid for. </sentence><sentence id="201">They gave a certain amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, this was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="203">And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either. </sentence><sentence id="204">So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so. </sentence><sentence id="205">They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. </sentence><sentence id="206">We didn't accept that. </sentence><sentence id="207">And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to <span class="country">Holland</span>, and my personal story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I was then 5 years. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left. </sentence><sentence id="236">I'm very thankful that we could leave. </sentence><sentence id="237">Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time. </sentence><sentence id="238">In <span class="country">Holland</span>, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. </sentence><sentence id="239">The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> if I remember correctly, but fled to <span class="country">Holland</span> whereas the Hutterians went to <span class="region">Moravia</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: How many of you did they take in in <span class="country">Holland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: I think we were about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="249">Let me say something. </sentence><sentence id="250">In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>, we started a new <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">And members of the German community had to move over to <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span> to support this group of children. </sentence><sentence id="252">So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two <span class="populated place">communities</span> is much more difficult than one. </sentence><sentence id="253">So when the Nazis confiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. </sentence><sentence id="254">Some when to the <span class="populated place">Lichenstein community</span> called <span class="populated place">__ Bruderhof</span>, and the others went to <span class="country">England</span> where we had already started a <span class="populated place">community</span> because of the tense political situation in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">The young men who received military service in <span class="country">Germany</span> escaped illegally across the <span class="dlf">boundary</span> and went to <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">And in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span> the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge. </sentence><sentence id="257">And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>, they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast. </sentence><sentence id="258">Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government." </sentence><sentence id="259">So when this happened we needed to find a place somewhere else to go to. </sentence><sentence id="260">And this place we found in German...in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">So as we left <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1937, there was already a <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">We tried to get into <span class="country">England</span>, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government. </sentence><sentence id="263">So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their <span class="building">church buildings</span>, in their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">They gave us toys. </sentence><sentence id="265">They made collection amongst themselves for  <span class="spatial object">toys</span>, for blankets, for food. </sentence><sentence id="266">Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="267">I remember very well we never had any <span class="spatial object">roller scooters</span> if...if that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle. </sentence><sentence id="268">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in <span class="country">Holland</span>, there were nice, black topped <span class="dlf">paths</span> and <span class="dlf">roads</span> and we got these <span class="spatial object">roller scooters</span> with rubber tires. </sentence><sentence id="269">Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. </sentence><sentence id="270">That was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from <span class="country">Holland</span> to my father who was in <span class="building">prison</span> with the Nazis in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the <span class="building">prison</span> down." </sentence><sentence id="272">My father received this letter in <span class="building">prison</span> and everybody laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then I remember when we traveled to <span class="country">England</span>, we crossed the <span class="dlf">channel</span> on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from <span class="country">England</span> came over to help us. </sentence><sentence id="275">And one of them was called <span class="building">Adolph Brown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I remember crossing the <span class="dlf">Channel</span> on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">Then we came to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">And in <span class="populated place">Enoland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">we had started this communitv called the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">near --T'm not  also I felt as a child living in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">We had many air raid practices, living in the <span class="interior space">3rd floors</span> of the <span class="building">manor house</span> getting into the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="283">I remember nackages of dried banana and  <span class="building">student union</span> down here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to <span class="country">Canada</span>, <span class="region">South Dakota</span>, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">The government was very much in favor. </sentence><sentence id="285">My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt. </sentence><sentence id="286">She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point. </sentence><sentence id="288">Wait til January or February after the inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="289">As I think about this, the question comes why? </sentence><sentence id="290">Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. </sentence><sentence id="291">Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare. </sentence><sentence id="292">We don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="294">I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. </sentence><sentence id="295">It goes against my conscience. </sentence><sentence id="296">And so all these things made the <span class="building">government</span> aware that it might not be a good moment to come in. </sentence><sentence id="297">And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. </sentence><sentence id="298">It didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="299">And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, <span class="region">South America</span>, which is in the heart of <span class="region">South America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">We didn't know where this place was. </sentence><sentence id="301">We looked it up on the map. </sentence><sentence id="302">Now, my father was in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">I was still in <span class="country">England</span> in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">And when we heard we could travel to <span class="region">South America</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, we started reading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we read about snakes and <span class="env feature">jungles</span> and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="306">And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the <span class="populated place">community</span>, we were on the first group. </sentence><sentence id="308">We left <span class="country">England</span> in 1940 I think. </sentence><sentence id="309">39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="310">We went...traveled in <span class="spatial object">buses</span> to <span class="populated place">Burn</span>, to <span class="populated place">Liverpool</span>, spent the night there in a <span class="building">hotel</span> which I remember from...went to the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was big <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and into the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">Nothing hannened that nicht. </sentence><sentence id="313">and I remember getting on to this shin called -- which the  from the <span class="spatial object">oceanliner</span> to the <span class="spatial object">river boat</span>, so that nobody could run away and get into <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">So we traveled up this <span class="env feature">river</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span> Parana, 4, 5 days at least. </sentence><sentence id="315">Third class. </sentence><sentence id="316">It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. </sentence><sentence id="317">We ended up in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, I think at Christmas time, which is south of the <span class="env feature">equator</span>; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="318">And then we transferred to another <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and went up the <span class="env feature">Paraguay River</span> another 4 or 5 days til we came to --~ which is verv close to northern...to <span class="country">Brazil</span> in the <span class="region">northern nart</span> of <span class="populated place">Parasuav</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">There  0 <span class="region">Chaco part</span> is all <span class="env feature">brackish water</span>, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing. </sentence><sentence id="320">The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole <span class="region">Chaco</span> is a <span class="region">military area</span> under the...under the government of the <span class="building">military institution</span>, which we also didn't like too much. </sentence><sentence id="321">Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="322">When we were there, my...let me think. </sentence><sentence id="323">I have three brothers...four brothers live in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and in <span class="country">England</span> a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the <span class="region">Chaco</span> right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites. </sentence><sentence id="324">They had a <span class="building">hospital</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="325">Our <span class="populated place">communities</span> had brought 3 doctors who had joined the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering. </sentence><sentence id="326">Other children were born there. </sentence><sentence id="327">So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider. </sentence><sentence id="328">Pregnant mothers, little babies. </sentence><sentence id="329">These things. </sentence><sentence id="330">I remember meeting Indians in the <span class="region">Chaco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="332">And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life. </sentence><sentence id="333">They...if somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. </sentence><sentence id="334">They cared for each other and helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="335">And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. </sentence><sentence id="336">My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the , of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some <span class="region">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?" </sentence><sentence id="338">And the Indian said, "One dollar." </sentence><sentence id="339">And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="340">Shake hands on this. </sentence><sentence id="341">That's enough. </sentence><sentence id="342">We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents." </sentence><sentence id="343">In the end, we decided not to stay in the <span class="region">Chaco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">It was too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="345">The agriculture ___ was too bad. </sentence><sentence id="346">It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it. </sentence><sentence id="347">So then the brothers went to what is called East...east <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, _ <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, and there along side some other <span class="populated place">Mennonite colonies</span>, we found a big...not an <span class="dlf">estate</span>, a big...uh...<span class="dlf">cattle ranch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="349">And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. </sentence><sentence id="350">And we called it...it was called <span class="populated place">Priwara</span>, which means Spring. </sentence><sentence id="351">So when this became clear, we all got on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they drove us out on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">We got back to <span class="dlf">kilometer 144</span>, drove to <span class="populated place">Kasaro</span>, got on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called <span class="populated place">Protorosario</span>, which means <span class="building">Rosario Port</span>, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their <span class="spatial object">horse wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">We drove 60 kilometers <span class="region">inland</span> to this new place which we had acquired. </sentence><sentence id="354">There were no <span class="building">buildings</span> on this place. </sentence><sentence id="355">It was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="356">It was just wild <span class="env feature">woods</span>...uh...<span class="env feature">plains</span>, <span class="env feature">swamp</span>, and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build <span class="building">houses</span>, we children stayed with the Mennonites in their <span class="building">schools</span>, in their <span class="building">homes</span>...I think again for at least 1 or 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="357">And then finally we could all move up to the <span class="populated place">Primiwara</span>, and start our community life again. </sentence><sentence id="358">As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="359">In <span class="country">Switzerland</span> were scrapped and they went to <span class="country">Germany</span>, they started from with nothing, with the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, and the left that, went to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. </sentence><sentence id="361">Now in <span class="populated place">Primawara</span>, we started building <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">Uh...In that <span class="country">country</span>, there is a lot of timber, so we had to get timber. </sentence><sentence id="363">You cut the <span class="env feature">trees</span> yourself. </sentence><sentence id="364">You can't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="365">You cut the <span class="env feature">trees</span> in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">You brine them out what thev call -- which is a contrantion consisting of two  1 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then you cut it up by hand. </sentence><sentence id="367">You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="368">We built four big <span class="interior space">halls</span>, a <span class="dlf">roof</span>, no <span class="dlf">walls</span>, no <span class="dlf">interior walls</span>, and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better <span class="building">housing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">We started right away with agriculture, which is basically all we knew. </sentence><sentence id="370">We start with <span class="building">tannery</span>, <span class="building">wooden tannery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, there's some wonderful <span class="env feature">woods</span>, exotic <span class="env feature">woods</span>, which make beautiful <span class="spatial object">vases</span>, <span class="spatial object">sugar bowls</span>, <span class="spatial object">candle holders</span>, things like that which people buy. </sentence><sentence id="372">So we went into <span class="building">tannery</span> and agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="373">We started our own <span class="building">school</span> there, and I remember that there were 3 <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">It's hot in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">It's <span class="region">sub-tropical country</span>, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100, very humid. </sentence><sentence id="376">Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit. </sentence><sentence id="377">There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather. </sentence><sentence id="378">So in this place called <span class="populated place">Priawara</span>, there were three <span class="env feature">wood islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">The first one...the first one we cleared and built a <span class="interior space">dining room</span>, <span class="interior space">communal kitchen</span> and a <span class="building">store house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="380">And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the <span class="building">preschool</span> and the <span class="building">kindergarten</span> (clearing throat) and in the third one we cleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the <span class="env feature">cactus</span> on the brush, and then we...there we built some <span class="building">school houses</span>, <span class="interior space">school rooms</span>, where all the children were educated. </sentence><sentence id="381">We had our own teachers which we always wanted. </sentence><sentence id="382">We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values. </sentence><sentence id="383">Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a <span class="building">school</span> to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction. </sentence><sentence id="384">So this we had our own <span class="building">school</span> with our own teachers. </sentence><sentence id="385">It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already. </sentence><sentence id="386">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span> we stayed til 1960. </sentence><sentence id="387">I lived there for 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="388">I also lived part of my life in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>, and also a <span class="country">country</span> in <span class="region">South America</span>, Montediveo.(Clearing throat) While we were in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, there were some revolutions. </sentence><sentence id="389">There're always revolutions somewhere going on. </sentence><sentence id="390">And we were on the...on the <span class="dlf">battle line</span>...uh...different parties winning and losing. </sentence><sentence id="391">They always asked us to help them supply <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="392">We always refused this. </sentence><sentence id="393">If a soldier's hungry, we give him food. </sentence><sentence id="394">If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way. </sentence><sentence id="395">And this was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="396">My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. </sentence><sentence id="397">But I feel that by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. </sentence><sentence id="398">If one starts compromising, it gets...one gets on <span class="env feature">slippery ground</span> very fast.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: What was the government's reaction... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: The <span class="building">Paraguayan government</span> was...is a <span class="building">Catholic government</span> complete. </sentence><sentence id="555">The whole <span class="country">country</span> is Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="556">They took us in because they needed people on the...on the <span class="env feature">land</span> working agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="557"><span class="country">Paraguay</span> is a <span class="country">country</span> which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a big war with <span class="country">Bolivia</span>, <span class="country">Argentina</span> and <span class="country">Brazil</span>, and they lost enormous amount of people there, especially men and boys. </sentence><sentence id="558">So they needed people to come to the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">Not business people in the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, but on the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious freedom. </sentence><sentence id="561">We were not Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="562">They gave us complete authority in our <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="563">No policeman had any business there. </sentence><sentence id="564">They gave us freedom of <span class="building">school</span>...of teaching children  2 how we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. </sentence><sentence id="565">And this...this was...this made us very happy that this was possible. </sentence><sentence id="566">So the government was very friendly in that way. </sentence><sentence id="567">And we worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="568">We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and this <span class="building">tannery</span> and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the <span class="country">United States</span>, which helps <span class="country">third world countries</span> improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans. </sentence><sentence id="569">Different things like that. </sentence><sentence id="570">They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists amongst members, and so they had a <span class="building">station</span> on our <span class="region">land</span> where they experimented to improve peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="571">So we worked with them, and that also helped us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="572">In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. </sentence><sentence id="573">The cows were all wild cows. </sentence><sentence id="574">They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="575">So we needed to improve the <span class="spatial object">dairy</span>, and this took year but it got improved eventually. </sentence><sentence id="576">For us children, it was actually a nice time. </sentence><sentence id="577">We never suffered hunger. </sentence><sentence id="578">We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. </sentence><sentence id="579">We had beans. </sentence><sentence id="580">This is fine. </sentence><sentence id="581">One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="582">We had the <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="583">We were cared for. </sentence><sentence id="584">There was a lot of sickness at first. </sentence><sentence id="585">Eye diseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. </sentence><sentence id="586">All these things happened. </sentence><sentence id="587">But...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it possible to get over this time. </sentence><sentence id="588">Now, the...the <span class="building">school</span> was all in...in English I think. </sentence><sentence id="589">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="590">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, we spoke only German. </sentence><sentence id="591">In <span class="country">England</span> we switched over from German and English. </sentence><sentence id="592">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish, so I grow up in three languages. </sentence><sentence id="593">That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little wobbly as Pooh Bear would say. </sentence><sentence id="594">So we had this <span class="building">school</span> there, and we had 9 years of <span class="building">school</span> to the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the <span class="populated place">community</span>, to go to <span class="building">public school</span>, to go to <span class="building">high school</span> but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. </sentence><sentence id="595">So he and I went to <span class="populated place">Ascuncion</span>, the <span class="populated place">capitol</span>, where some other people were studying to be teachers. </sentence><sentence id="596">Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. </sentence><sentence id="597">We went there to what's called the <span class="building">Kindergrotto</span>, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the <span class="building">primary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, they...I think they use a French system. </sentence><sentence id="599">Six years primary education, six years <span class="building">high school</span>, and then six or seven years <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">That's how the system works. </sentence><sentence id="601">So we were quite old,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto. </sentence><sentence id="602">We didn't know any Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. ( </sentence><sentence id="603">Laughing) Even in the <span class="building">State-run schools</span>, they hardly had any...any...uh...<span class="spatial object">notebooks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="604">No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. </sentence><sentence id="605">I remember writing everything down as fast I could. </sentence><sentence id="606">They speak very fast, and then I went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="607">He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the <span class="populated place">community</span> who was studying to be a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="608">He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later. </sentence><sentence id="609">And I stayed in this <span class="populated place">community</span> in the...the <span class="building">Bruderhof house</span> as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education. </sentence><sentence id="610">This <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> served a number of functions. </sentence><sentence id="611">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span> you can't just.. uh...order something and <span class="building">UPS</span> brings it. </sentence><sentence id="612">It doesn't work like that. </sentence><sentence id="613">It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the <span class="building">capitol</span> and then you had to organize transport from the <span class="building">capitol</span> to the <span class="populated place">colony</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. </sentence><sentence id="615">Everything had to be bought in the <span class="building">capitol</span> and then transported to the <span class="populated place">colony</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: So this <span class="building">house</span> which we had in..uh...in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, the <span class="populated place">capitol</span>, was a <span class="building">building</span> which we rented and later bought. </sentence><sentence id="685">And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to <span class="building">secondary school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span> and maybe could be compared to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="686">We also had some people there. </sentence><sentence id="687">We had a...<span class="building">store</span>, where we sold tanned goods from the...from the <span class="populated place">community</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="688">And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="689">Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these. </sentence><sentence id="690">We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there. </sentence><sentence id="691">And this <span class="populated place">capitol</span> also, all the business was transacted. </sentence><sentence id="692">As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="693">Cloth. </sentence><sentence id="694">All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this <span class="populated place">colony</span> which we had. </sentence><sentence id="695">To get from <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span> to the <span class="populated place">colony</span> took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day. </sentence><sentence id="696">One night traveling with a little <span class="spatial object">river boat</span>, maybe...yeah..to and then a dav""s travel with a <span class="spatial object">horse wagon</span> from the nort to the colonv...to the  5 the <span class="country">country</span>, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation. </sentence><sentence id="697">That is not our purpose. </sentence><sentence id="698">Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together. </sentence><sentence id="699">That this is possible right now. </sentence><sentence id="700">And we are... am not better than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="701">I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it...where do I say stop? </sentence><sentence id="702">And living in <span class="populated place">community</span>, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. </sentence><sentence id="703">This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for. </sentence><sentence id="704">And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="705">We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible. </sentence><sentence id="706">To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="707">To bums to rich men. </sentence><sentence id="708">And so when these people came from <span class="region">North America</span>, they asked many questions. </sentence><sentence id="709">Why you do this? </sentence><sentence id="710">Why you this? </sentence><sentence id="711">And this is good for us. </sentence><sentence id="712">We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do. </sentence><sentence id="713">And so this was good. </sentence><sentence id="714">In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the <span class="country">States</span> traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. </sentence><sentence id="715">There was an intentional community movement in the <span class="country">United States</span> in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="716">Why don't you start a <span class="populated place">community</span> up here?" </sentence><sentence id="717">So in 1954, we started a <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="region">New York State</span> near...between <span class="populated place">Kingston</span> and <span class="populated place">Poughkeepsie</span>. </sentence><sentence id="718">There's a little <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Roseton</span>, near <span class="populated place">Newport</span>, and there we bought some <span class="region">land</span> and some <span class="building">houses</span> and started <span class="building">Hutterian Bruderhof</span> where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good. ( </sentence><sentence id="719">Clearing throat) Now back to <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="720">I went to <span class="building">school</span> and then I went to <span class="building">University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="721">I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. </sentence><sentence id="722">And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the <span class="building">university</span> and <span class="region">South American</span> altogether and also in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="723">The students are active social movement. </sentence><sentence id="724">They...the young people protest injustice, the

day the police came and closed the <span class="building">university</span> down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. </sentence><sentence id="727">They called it communists. </sentence><sentence id="728">And...uh...so the closed the <span class="building">university</span> down and the Brother decided that I should go to <span class="populated place">Montediveo</span> in <span class="country">Uruguay</span> to continue with the studies. </sentence><sentence id="729">And so I went down there and finished up later on. </sentence><sentence id="730">And it was in <span
