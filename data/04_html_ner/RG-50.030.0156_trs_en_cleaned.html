<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you state your name and birth date please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. </sentence><sentence id="7">My father will tell his own story. </sentence><sentence id="8">My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people. </sentence><sentence id="9">As I said, I was born in a little <span class="dlf">farm</span> there which they had rented. </sentence><sentence id="10">And while they were living in <span class="populated place">community</span> there, they got to...into contact with another <span class="populated place">community</span> which started in <span class="country">Germany</span> 1920. </sentence><sentence id="11">I want to give a brief history of this <span class="populated place">community</span> because it's important. </sentence><sentence id="12">Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in <span class="country">Africa</span>, sent there by the Amold family from <span class="region">North America</span> had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus is, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time. </sentence><sentence id="13">And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace. </sentence><sentence id="14">He started in <span class="country">Germany</span> 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. </sentence><sentence id="15">So he got into contact with my parents on the little <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> near <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but rejected it. </sentence><sentence id="17">He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work. </sentence><sentence id="18">And on this <span class="dlf">farm</span> they were milking cows, working in a <span class="building">cooperative</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="19">The <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> called <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span> heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to <span class="building">prison</span> for this in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and Everett visited my father in <span class="building">prison</span> and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">The problem was that in a <span class="populated place">socialist agnostic community</span> like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in <span class="populated place">community</span> it will break apart. </sentence><sentence id="21">The tensions are too great. </sentence><sentence id="22">So in this <span class="populated place">Swiss community</span>, they didn't find unity. </sentence><sentence id="23">The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members. </sentence><sentence id="24">Whereas in the <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span>, the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, there was a unity which was possible. </sentence><sentence id="25">You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big <span class="building">world churches</span>, the Catholics and the Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="26">Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">And my parents joined that <span class="populated place">community</span> in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="28">Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me. </sentence><sentence id="29">Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole <span class="populated place">community</span>, to the members, "Hitler has come to power. </sentence><sentence id="30">Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit? </sentence><sentence id="31">Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?And on this question, some left. </sentence><sentence id="32">My parents stayed. </sentence><sentence id="33">On...L...] had three other brothers born to  my family in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier. </sentence><sentence id="35">I do not remember any kind of persecution in <span class="country">Germany</span> itself, but I remember fear. </sentence><sentence id="36">Just fear. </sentence><sentence id="37">And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in <span class="country">Germany</span> about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies. </sentence><sentence id="39">The members of the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him." </sentence><sentence id="40">When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists. </sentence><sentence id="42">They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on. </sentence><sentence id="43">My father then was sent to take important documents to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> out of the reach of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to find out what they had in mind with us. </sentence><sentence id="45">Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the <span class="building">power structure</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">In <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, my father went to the <span class="building">headquarters</span> and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the <span class="region">Nazi state</span> shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the ____, which according to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the opposite of God's love. </sentence><sentence id="47">The beast of the ___ is the opposite of God...of God. </sentence><sentence id="48">So this Nazi man said, "Just for having said that, we must dissolve you because you are against everything which the Nazi government represents." </sentence><sentence id="49">Then...so I heard this from my father, and then I know that in 1934, the Nazis sent a school inspector into our <span class="building">private school</span> which they had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="50">We had not taught that. </sentence><sentence id="51">And they said, "We will close your <span class="building">school</span> or send German teachers." </sentence><sentence id="52">This we could not tolerate, so we took our children to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">My father was instrumental in this. </sentence><sentence id="54">In <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, our <span class="building">school</span> children were rejected. </sentence><sentence id="55">They did not get permission to enter <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">The Swiss government said, "Be obedient to your government. </sentence><sentence id="57">Why take your children out?" </sentence><sentence id="58">So they did not understand us. </sentence><sentence id="59">And for this... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: You recall...what part do you recall as how it affected you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: I was then...uh...2, 3 years old. </sentence><sentence id="119">I was not in this <span class="building">school</span> children who left who were in <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">I stayed on the _Bruderhof with my parents being Swiss and in some way protected from the...from the Nazis, from the German officials. </sentence><sentence id="121">But I remember then for myself as the death of my fourth...third brother, Daniel Meier. </sentence><sentence id="122">He was born in ___ on March 29, 1937. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I remember my father taking me to my mother in the <span class="building">Fulda hospital</span> to see this little baby. </sentence><sentence id="124">And the 14 days after he was born, came the raid which... where the Gestapo...uh...confiscated and destroyed the <span class="populated place">community</span> as such. </sentence><sentence id="125">They occu...they came in the early morning. </sentence><sentence id="126">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="127">They surrounded the whole <span class="populated place">community</span> and they told everybody to get into the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">Leave the <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, the <span class="interior space">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">Just leave everything and be in the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">I don't remember getting and ask questions or so but I remember the picture and the fear which...which I had. </sentence><sentence id="131">And the governments...the...the Nazis  said, "Leave right away." </sentence><sentence id="132">But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad. </sentence><sentence id="133">There was some sick people. </sentence><sentence id="134">So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. </sentence><sentence id="135">And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and they took us to a <span class="spatial object">train</span>...I believe in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">I think it was <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, then they took us to the <span class="dlf">Dutch boundary</span> and pushed us over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">I've often wondered why my father went to the...to <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span> for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the <span class="populated place">community</span> as because they figured we were enemies of the state. </sentence><sentence id="140">But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from <span class="region">North America</span>, they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us. </sentence><sentence id="141">Now I remember these two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="142">And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in <span class="country">Austria</span>, <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, <span class="region">Moravia</span>, which is today <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, began a life in <span class="populated place">community</span> like we live it today. </sentence><sentence id="143">And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. </sentence><sentence id="144">By the Catholics, the Protestants, the <span class="building">churches</span> and the governments. </sentence><sentence id="145">They found refuge in <span class="region">Moravia</span> because hundred years before this, , there was a spiritual awaking and there was more tolerance in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> than in the rest of the Austrian empires. </sentence><sentence id="146">And we Hutterians were persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="147">I think more than two thousand were burned, killed, decapitated or drowned, whatever they did, and they fled from <span class="region">Moravia</span> into <span class="country">Hungary</span>, then later on to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">They lost the community life on two occasions, and it started again. </sentence><sentence id="149">On hundred years ago, in 1874, they migrated to the <span class="country">United States</span> because the Russian who had promised them exemption of military service, wanted to force them to do military service. </sentence><sentence id="150">But they refused and migrated. </sentence><sentence id="151">Now, two of these...excuse me, I have to go back now. </sentence><sentence id="152"><span class="populated place">Everett Amold</span> and the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, when they heard in 1928 about that there were...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that they had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the <span class="country">United States</span> for not being anti-German in the first world war, many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were taken to <span class="populated place">Alcatraz</span> and later on to <span class="building">Fort Levinsworth</span>, and they died from exposure because of the treatment they got from the American military. </sentence><sentence id="153">After they had died, there were...they put the uniforms on and sent the bodies <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">They refused to put the uniform on while they lived. </sentence><sentence id="155">This we heard in <span class="country">Germany</span>, published in the <span class="building">Mennonite newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">And <span class="populated place">Everett</span> and the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> felt here is a group that unanimously stick to their principles, even unto death. </sentence><sentence id="157">This is something we have to know. </sentence><sentence id="158">So Everett himself went in 1930 to the <span class="populated place">Hutterian communities</span> in <span class="region">South Dakota</span>, <span class="region">North Dakota</span>, and I believe some over in <span class="country">Canada</span>; visited them all and united with them, 1930. </sentence><sentence id="159">He came back in at the end of 30, I think, or at beginning of 31. </sentence><sentence id="160">Hitler came to power in 33. </sentence><sentence id="161">And in 1937, two of these American and Canadian brothers were visiting the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> just the time when the Nazis...uh...confiscated the whole lot. </sentence><sentence id="162">When...the Gestapo searched everything, they met up with these two and they pulled out their American passports and said, "Sorry, we don't allow this. </sentence><sentence id="163">You cannot search us. </sentence><sentence id="164">We are American citizens." </sentence><sentence id="165">And there the Gestapo got afraid about propaganda in...in <span class="country">America</span> and changed the accusation from, as I said, enemy of the state to criminal bankruptcy which my father can tell how that worked. </sentence><sentence id="166">So we left then <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1937 and I...I thought a lot about why...why is it that all of us escaped without a single one dying in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> or in <span class="building">prison</span>? </sentence><sentence id="167">And I don't really know the answer except that I believe God protected us. </sentence><sentence id="168">But I know from our side we did not compromise at  any point with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="169">We did not raise an arm in salute. </sentence><sentence id="170">We did not go along with his politics. </sentence><sentence id="171">We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. </sentence><sentence id="172">We all...not I. | was a child. </sentence><sentence id="173">But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: How...how did it affect you at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: As I said, I was 5 years old. </sentence><sentence id="233">I was just afraid. </sentence><sentence id="234">That's all I know, and from...from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">At certain times, I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="236">And other times, I was a child growing up in this <span class="populated place">community</span> very much cared and loved for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the <span class="populated place">community</span> to your <span class="populated place">community</span> that caused this fear in you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Uh...L...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. </sentence><sentence id="245">And my father was away often for the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> finding refuge for the children. </sentence><sentence id="246">Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. </sentence><sentence id="247">His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child. </sentence><sentence id="248">This is...this is what I can say. </sentence><sentence id="249">But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was in...within the <span class="populated place">community</span>, it was protected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: How did the <span class="populated place">community</span> protect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: How did your <span class="populated place">community</span> live at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Our <span class="populated place">community</span> lived on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">I'm not quite sure how many <span class="env feature">acres</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">They were farming. </sentence><sentence id="267">They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all <span class="populated place">city</span> people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="268">The <span class="env feature">land</span> was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">We lived in <span class="building">community houses</span> like the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> do today. </sentence><sentence id="270">We had our own <span class="building">school</span> and <span class="building">preschool</span> and <span class="building">kindergarten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community. </sentence><sentence id="272">So the influence from the outside was very low or nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Was the <span class="populated place">community</span> self sufficient? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: It was self sufficient up to a point. </sentence><sentence id="285">We took...the <span class="populated place">community</span> took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and <span class="building">lodging</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected. </sentence><sentence id="287">We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. </sentence><sentence id="288">Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically. </sentence><sentence id="289">How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. </sentence><sentence id="290">We farmed. </sentence><sentence id="291">We had <span class="building">wood tannery</span>, and we printed books. </sentence><sentence id="292">And the sale of books and <span class="building">tannery</span> was part of  the cash income, where as the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was the food. </sentence><sentence id="293">We...we never sold food. </sentence><sentence id="294">We always just grew food for our own use. </sentence><sentence id="295">And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="296">There was a time in <span class="country">Germany</span> when we had friends outside <span class="country">Germany</span> who gave us money, which was stuck in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">I forget what the term is. </sentence><sentence id="298">They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>, so friends gave us that money and the <span class="building">banks</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> would not give us the money. </sentence><sentence id="299">So they made our life more and more diffuclt. </sentence><sentence id="300">We took in children from broken <span class="building">homes</span> and needy situations, which the German government of the <span class="populated place">Weimer republic</span> had paid for. </sentence><sentence id="301">They gave a certain amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="302">Well, this was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="303">And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either. </sentence><sentence id="304">So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so. </sentence><sentence id="305">They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. </sentence><sentence id="306">We didn't accept that. </sentence><sentence id="307">And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to <span class="country">Holland</span>, and my personal story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: I was then 5 years. </sentence><sentence id="335">And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left. </sentence><sentence id="336">I'm very thankful that we could leave. </sentence><sentence id="337">Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time. </sentence><sentence id="338">In <span class="country">Holland</span>, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. </sentence><sentence id="339">The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> if I remember correctly, but fled to <span class="country">Holland</span> whereas the Hutterians went to <span class="region">Moravia</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: How many of you did they take in in <span class="country">Holland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: I think we were about 50 people. </sentence><sentence id="349">Let me say something. </sentence><sentence id="350">In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>, we started a new <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">And members of the German community had to move over to <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span> to support this group of children. </sentence><sentence id="352">So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two <span class="populated place">communities</span> is much more difficult than one. </sentence><sentence id="353">So when the Nazis confiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. </sentence><sentence id="354">Some when to the <span class="populated place">Lichenstein community</span> called <span class="populated place">__ Bruderhof</span>, and the others went to <span class="country">England</span> where we had already started a <span class="populated place">community</span> because of the tense political situation in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">The young men who received military service in <span class="country">Germany</span> escaped illegally across the <span class="dlf">boundary</span> and went to <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">And in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span> the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge. </sentence><sentence id="357">And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>, they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast. </sentence><sentence id="358">Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government." </sentence><sentence id="359">So when this happened we needed to find a place somewhere else to go to. </sentence><sentence id="360">And this place we found in German...in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">So as we left <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1937, there was already a <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">We tried to get into <span class="country">England</span>, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government. </sentence><sentence id="363">So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their <span class="building">church buildings</span>, in their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">They gave us toys. </sentence><sentence id="365">They made collection amongst themselves for  <span class="spatial object">toys</span>, for blankets, for food. </sentence><sentence id="366">Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="367">I remember very well we never had any <span class="spatial object">roller scooters</span> if...if that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle. </sentence><sentence id="368">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in <span class="country">Holland</span>, there were nice, black topped <span class="dlf">paths</span> and <span class="dlf">roads</span> and we got these <span class="spatial object">roller scooters</span> with rubber tires. </sentence><sentence id="369">Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. </sentence><sentence id="370">That was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="371">Now (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from <span class="country">Holland</span> to my father who was in <span class="building">prison</span> with the Nazis in <span class="populated place">Fulda</span>, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the <span class="building">prison</span> down." </sentence><sentence id="372">My father received this letter in <span class="building">prison</span> and everybody laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="373">And then I remember when we traveled to <span class="country">England</span>, we crossed the <span class="dlf">channel</span> on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from <span class="country">England</span> came over to help us. </sentence><sentence id="375">And one of them was called <span class="building">Adolph Brown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="377">And I remember crossing the <span class="dlf">Channel</span> on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">Then we came to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">And in <span class="country">England</span>, we had started this <span class="populated place">community</span> called the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, near . </sentence><sentence id="380">I'm not quite sure geographically where it's situated. </sentence><sentence id="381">And this <span class="populated place">community</span> was also a <span class="populated place">agricultural community</span>, and we started farming right away. </sentence><sentence id="382">We built <span class="building">houses</span> and in <span class="country">England</span> then all, the whole <span class="populated place">community</span> gathered. </sentence><sentence id="383">From <span class="populated place">Lichenstein</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span> 150 people about altogether. </sentence><sentence id="384">There was an increasing war fever because Hitler was doing his thing, and everybody was getting ready. </sentence><sentence id="385">And so it was a time of decision. </sentence><sentence id="386">And many English people felt that violence is not the answer to human problems, and so in the 4 years we spent in <span class="country">England</span> from 37 to 40...or 36 to 40, the size of the community doubled with English..uh...men and women, married and single, old and young, who felt that a life in <span class="populated place">community</span> without wages, working together, serving each other instead of expecting service, was the answer to our human needs. </sentence><sentence id="387">And so the <span class="populated place">community</span> doubled in this size. </sentence><sentence id="388">We had this one <span class="populated place">community</span>, . </sentence><sentence id="389">We had another <span class="dlf">farm</span> close by, 5 miles, called <span class="dlf">Telling farm</span>, and <span class="populated place">Bruderhof</span>, the third one. </sentence><sentence id="390">And I remember this time quite well. </sentence><sentence id="391">I was 5 to 9...9 years of age. </sentence><sentence id="392">And maybe what could help most for the...for my story now is that there was a time when in <span class="country">England</span> when all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> had to be black outed. </sentence><sentence id="393">I believe that was when the war started. </sentence><sentence id="394">And so we did this. </sentence><sentence id="395">We had built three <span class="building">houses</span> in <span class="env feature">willow trees</span> along the <span class="env feature">brooks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">All these <span class="building">tree houses</span> were taken down because the English people were afraid we would be signaling the <span class="spatial object">German airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="397">Being Germans. </sentence><sentence id="398">They forgot we had escaped. </sentence><sentence id="399">They just saw us as Germans. </sentence><sentence id="400">The...I wasn't German. </sentence><sentence id="401">I'm Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="402">But they..they made us take all these <span class="building">treehouses</span> down. </sentence><sentence id="403">They took...put concrete pillows in the <span class="env feature">meadows</span> so we wouldn't let the <span class="spatial object">German airplanes</span> land and they even...uh...made <span class="dlf">ditches</span> so that nothing could... They were very scared of us. </sentence><sentence id="404">And I...I'm very sorry for that because I...I don't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="405">They were so scared of us that this fear turned into hatehood, and on one occasion, at least, the surrounding...some of the surrounding population came half drunk, enraged, to burn the <span class="populated place">community</span> down. </sentence><sentence id="406">The atmosphere in <span class="country">England</span> was very warlike atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="407">You either were for the English and against the Germans or you were an enemy. </sentence><sentence id="408">This kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="409">The <span class="populated place">community</span> supported itself partly also by having a <span class="dlf">merry-go-ground</span>, a <span class="dlf">vegetable ground</span>, bread, butter, eggs. </sentence><sentence id="410">This was finished from one day to the other nearly, because they feared...rumors were going around that we were putting poison in the milk to kill English children. </sentence><sentence id="411">So this atmosphere  also I felt as a child living in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">We had many air raid practices, living in the <span class="interior space">3rd floors</span> of the <span class="building">manor house</span> getting into the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="413">I remember packages of dried banana and some chocolate and nuts in case we were stuck down there. </sentence><sentence id="414">And I remember also that...uh...a <span class="spatial object">German bomb</span> dropped very close or on our <span class="dlf">property</span> while we were in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">This all made an atmosphere of fear, which I also felt. </sentence><sentence id="416">But within the <span class="populated place">community</span> I...I felt safe. </sentence><sentence id="417">It...it wasn't a personal feeling. </sentence><sentence id="418">It was a general...a feeling of...of..-uh..of war. </sentence><sentence id="419">Now, I also remember that while we were in <span class="country">England</span>, we were approached by a Zionist group and asked if we could train some Jewish people in the , preparation for <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> life. </sentence><sentence id="420">And I think 40 or 50 came and spent some time with us, learning to work in agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="421">And when I went to <span class="country">Israel</span> now in 1985, I came to <span class="populated place">kibbutz Hasara</span>, with my father and some others, and we met some of these who have been in our <span class="populated place">community</span> 40 years ago, which was very interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: Do you know where these people came from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Where they came from? </sentence><sentence id="500">No. </sentence><sentence id="501">But I think...no, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="502">And from Europe, from <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, probably I think. </sentence><sentence id="503">Then the community also took in Jewish orphan children from <span class="country">Austria</span>, from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="504">We had friends who asked if we could help and we...I'm not sure of the number. </sentence><sentence id="505">I hear about maybe 12 children. </sentence><sentence id="506">And one of them, Lotta Berger, who came <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> who had lost her parents....they were killed...came to us and she is still with us today. </sentence><sentence id="507">She married. </sentence><sentence id="508">She became a member and she married under the family, a very good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="509">And (clearing throat) so we lived there in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">And then in 1940, and in 1939, because of the antagonism of the surrounding people...the government was friendly to us, but the people were very afraid of anything German. </sentence><sentence id="511">So the government hinted to us it might be better to leave the <span class="country">country</span> because if the tension grew, they would have to intern us for our own sake. </sentence><sentence id="512">Another thing which happened to us in <span class="country">England</span> was because of this war fever which could be compared to what happened in <span class="region">North America</span> with the Japanese and the <span class="region">West Coast</span> after <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span>, this kind of psychosis or whatever it is, made it that the...the police said, "No <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the <span class="populated place">community</span>." </sentence><sentence id="513">And when somebody did that they, this was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="514">They got us...we could get permission to leave further than 5 miles, but we had to get permission every time. </sentence><sentence id="515">This was another thing I remember. </sentence><sentence id="516">I remember the <span class="spatial object">German airplanes</span> flying overhead. </sentence><sentence id="517">You could hear by the noise of the motors that they were <span class="spatial object">German airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="518">I don't... cannot explain it. </sentence><sentence id="519">I was told this. </sentence><sentence id="520">And they...they bombed <span class="populated place">Coventry</span>, of course and <span class="populated place">Birmingham</span> and many <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="521">In our <span class="populated place">community</span>, we always represented that we have to love the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="522">Not only the fellow man, but also the enemy because only love can break the vicious cycle of violence. </sentence><sentence id="523">I kill you. </sentence><sentence id="524">You kill me. </sentence><sentence id="525">This kind of thing can only be broken and this is what I understand is God's will for us actually, that we should love people and leave the revenge to God as is spoken about many times by the prophets especially. </sentence><sentence id="526">So then when the government hinted that it's better for us to leave, my father was sent to <span class="region">North America</span> in 1940 to find out if we could come to <span class="region">North America</span> or <span class="country">Canada</span>, because we are brothers over here. </sentence><sentence id="527">And in <span class="country">Canada</span> they wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="528">They had enough trouble with those COs, conscientious objectors living in <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="529">Our brothers in <span class="region">South Dakota</span> offered us a whole <span class="dlf">farm</span>, ready with <span class="building">housing</span>, <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> and everything. </sentence><sentence id="530">So my father went to the...came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, came to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, lived in the  <span class="building">student union</span> down here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to <span class="country">Canada</span>, <span class="region">South Dakota</span>, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="531">The government was very much in favor. </sentence><sentence id="532">My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt. </sentence><sentence id="533">She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision. </sentence><sentence id="534">There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point. </sentence><sentence id="535">Wait til January or February after the inauguration. </sentence><sentence id="536">As I think about this, the question comes why? </sentence><sentence id="537">Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. </sentence><sentence id="538">Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare. </sentence><sentence id="539">We don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="540">I don't salute the flag. </sentence><sentence id="541">I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. </sentence><sentence id="542">It goes against my conscience. </sentence><sentence id="543">And so all these things made the <span class="building">government</span> aware that it might not be a good moment to come in. </sentence><sentence id="544">And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. </sentence><sentence id="545">It didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="546">And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, <span class="region">South America</span>, which is in the heart of <span class="region">South America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="547">We didn't know where this place was. </sentence><sentence id="548">We looked it up on the map. </sentence><sentence id="549">Now, my father was in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">I was still in <span class="country">England</span> in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="551">And when we heard we could travel to <span class="region">South America</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, we started reading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="552">And we read about snakes and <span class="env feature">jungles</span> and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="553">And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the <span class="populated place">community</span>, we were on the first group. </sentence><sentence id="555">We left <span class="country">England</span> in 1940 I think. </sentence><sentence id="556">39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="557">We went...traveled in <span class="spatial object">buses</span> to <span class="populated place">Burn</span>, to <span class="populated place">Liverpool</span>, spent the night there in a <span class="building">hotel</span> which I remember from...went to the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">There was big <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and into the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">Nothing happened that night, and I remember getting on to this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> called , which the British government used to bring meat in from <span class="country">Argentina</span> specially. </sentence><sentence id="560">And they had one class, which was first class, and then it was a <span class="spatial object">freight ship</span> actually. </sentence><sentence id="561">So 80 of us got on this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and then everything was black out. </sentence><sentence id="562">And I remember the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> sailing or steaming or whatever you call it...criss-crossed their way <span class="spatial object">sub</span>...uh...<span class="spatial object">submarine</span> attacks. </sentence><sentence id="563">This was at the height of the submarine war when the Germans more or less controlled the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> around <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">So it...that was also dangerous, and we were aware of this. </sentence><sentence id="565">I was 9 years, and I remember how on this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> then, I once had...I had a flashlight and I took it out in the gun ware and shone it, and everybody came and really hushed me up because that was a dangerous thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="566">I wasn't aware of what I was doing, but there was great fear of anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="567">We had a very nice time on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">I enjoyed it very much. </sentence><sentence id="569">They gave us very good food in the first class, and there was a big <span class="building">library</span> and films and everything. </sentence><sentence id="570">I was aware of the situation but not to the depth of it. </sentence><sentence id="571">As a child...I was a 9 year old, I enjoyed it also very much. </sentence><sentence id="572">We crossed.the <span class="env feature">Equator</span> and came to <span class="populated place">Rio de Janeiro</span>, the first <span class="populated place">city</span> we saw in full lights at night. </sentence><sentence id="573">It was a wonderful sight. </sentence><sentence id="574">Then we went to <span class="populated place">Buenos Aires</span>, transferred from the <span class="spatial object">oceanliner</span> to a <span class="spatial object">river boat</span>, and there I saw my father again. </sentence><sentence id="575">He had gone through <span class="country">Brazil</span> and <span class="country">Paraguay</span> and looked at different possibilities and met us in <span class="country">Argentina</span>, but you couldn't come on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> because we were only...they'd only...uh...pass us through...cross <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">We...we couldn't...this was under police escort and we were put on a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> with all the luggage and police escorted us  from the <span class="spatial object">oceanliner</span> to the <span class="spatial object">river boat</span>, so that nobody could run away and get into <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">So we traveled up this <span class="env feature">river</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span> Parana, 4, 5 days at least. </sentence><sentence id="578">Third class. </sentence><sentence id="579">It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. </sentence><sentence id="580">We ended up in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, I think at Christmas time, which is south of the <span class="env feature">equator</span>; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="581">And then we transferred to another <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and went up the <span class="env feature">Paraguay River</span> another 4 or 5 days til we came to , which is very close to northern...to <span class="country">Brazil</span> in the northern part of <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="582">There we got...uh...unto to a <span class="spatial object">train</span> without bump...without cushion bumpers without...it was a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">We couldn't drink water. </sentence><sentence id="584">It all had to be coffee. </sentence><sentence id="585">So I was trying...I was remember the part of <span class="country">Paraguay</span> Ascunion. </sentence><sentence id="586">The...the food on the living conditions on this <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="587">We were on the bottom of the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">I think there were three or four tiers of <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, or <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, and I remember now, there are no lights on this <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">The Captain has to steer the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> by the seat of his pants, as one says. </sentence><sentence id="590">The <span class="env feature">river</span> rises and falls and the <span class="dlf">sand banks</span> come and go. </sentence><sentence id="591">It's wild. </sentence><sentence id="592">And the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> gets...the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> gets stuck sometimes on <span class="dlf">sand banks</span> and ...uh...so we were the only one that traveled in the bottom of the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="593">The next groups and there were maybe 10 more, they traveled first class or second class for safety's sake. </sentence><sentence id="594">So we got up to this <span class="building">Chaco station</span>...uh... __, and there we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> 144 to <span class="dlf">kilometer 144</span>. </sentence><sentence id="595">Now you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="596">There were young babies, mothers, expecting mothers, fathers, everything...old people, young people, on this <span class="spatial object">train</span> traveling 144 kilometers into the <span class="env feature">bush</span>. </sentence><sentence id="597">Another name for the <span class="region">Chaco</span> is <span class="region">Green Hell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">And I can't confirm it is...it is <span class="region">Hell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">Many sand storms; hardly any <span class="env feature">water</span>; very hot, and very inhos...inhospitable; poisonous snakes. </sentence><sentence id="600">You name it. </sentence><sentence id="601">Tarantulas, diseases. </sentence><sentence id="602">All this is there. </sentence><sentence id="603">And <span class="dlf">kilometer 144</span> we had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="604">We were heading toward <span class="populated place">Mennonite colonies</span>, and if you remember I said that in <span class="country">Holland</span>, Mennonites had helped us. </sentence><sentence id="605">When our immigration to the <span class="country">United States</span> was not possible, again, Mennonites helped us find this place in <span class="country">Paraguay</span> and they alerted their members there to...we are coming and so <span class="dlf">kilometer 144</span>, we waited. </sentence><sentence id="606">It got dust. </sentence><sentence id="607">Some <span class="spatial object">horses wagons</span> were supposed to arrive to fetch us. </sentence><sentence id="608">They didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="609">They didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="610">But in the end they came. </sentence><sentence id="611">I think there must have been 20 <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="612"><span class="spatial object">Horse wagons</span> from 2 horses to a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> with wooden wheels, metal rimmed. </sentence><sentence id="613">We put our <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> on and everybody got on and we started off. </sentence><sentence id="614">It was so dusty you choked and could hardly see anything. </sentence><sentence id="615">We drove...we went through the night and stopped for a couple of hours. </sentence><sentence id="616">Around midnight, scared of snakes, but no...nobody got bit. </sentence><sentence id="617">And the next day, we arrived at this <span class="populated place">colony</span> in the <span class="region">Gran Chaco</span> of <span class="country">Paraguay</span> called <span class="populated place">Sanheim</span>, where Mennonites who had fled from <span class="country">Russia</span> and who had come from <span class="country">Canada</span> I think to avoid public education by the government. </sentence><sentence id="618">They wanted their own <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="619">They'd come to this place in the <span class="region">Chaco</span> in 19...in the 20s, so by 1940, they were quite well established. </sentence><sentence id="620">But they told us about many difficult hardships which they experienced there. </sentence><sentence id="621">Now, when we got there, they had prepared a banquet for us in their <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">Long <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, white table cloths, coffee with milk and sugar, home baked bread with butter, and home made cheese, and I can still taste it to this day if I think of it. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was so good. </sentence><sentence id="624">The families slept in the <span class="building">school houses</span> which the Mennonites had. </sentence><sentence id="625">It was holidays and...uh...I remember we stayed about 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="626">And while we were staying there, the...the...my father and others looked around for a suitable place where the community could settle, where we could start building <span class="building">houses</span> and live a community life again. </sentence><sentence id="627">And they traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="628">This I hear. </sentence><sentence id="629">I...I didn't do it myself. </sentence><sentence id="630">They traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="631">It was very difficult to find any place, because wherever you go, you needed <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">And the water in that  0 <span class="region">Chaco part</span> is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing. </sentence><sentence id="633">The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole <span class="region">Chaco</span> is a <span class="region">military area</span> under the...under the government of the <span class="building">military institution</span>, which we also didn't like too much. </sentence><sentence id="634">Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="635">When we were there, my...let me think. </sentence><sentence id="636">I have three brothers...four brothers live in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and in <span class="country">England</span> a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the <span class="region">Chaco</span> right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites. </sentence><sentence id="637">They had a <span class="building">hospital</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="638">Our <span class="populated place">communities</span> had brought 3 doctors who had joined the <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering. </sentence><sentence id="639">Other children were born there. </sentence><sentence id="640">So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider. </sentence><sentence id="641">Pregnant mothers, little babies. </sentence><sentence id="642">These things. </sentence><sentence id="643">I remember meeting Indians in the <span class="region">Chaco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="644">They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="645">And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life. </sentence><sentence id="646">They...if somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. </sentence><sentence id="647">They cared for each other and helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="648">And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. </sentence><sentence id="649">My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the , of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some <span class="region">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="650">And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?" </sentence><sentence id="651">And the Indian said, "One dollar." </sentence><sentence id="652">And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="653">Shake hands on this. </sentence><sentence id="654">That's enough. </sentence><sentence id="655">We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents." </sentence><sentence id="656">In the end, we decided not to stay in the <span class="region">Chaco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="657">It was too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="658">The agriculture ___ was too bad. </sentence><sentence id="659">It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it. </sentence><sentence id="660">So then the brothers went to what is called East...east <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, _ <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, and there along side some other <span class="populated place">Mennonite colonies</span>, we found a big...not an <span class="dlf">estate</span>, a big...uh...<span class="dlf">cattle ranch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="661">I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="662">And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. </sentence><sentence id="663">And we called it...it was called <span class="populated place">Priwara</span>, which means Spring. </sentence><sentence id="664">So when this became clear, we all got on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they drove us out on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">We got back to <span class="dlf">kilometer 144</span>, drove to <span class="populated place">Kasaro</span>, got on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called <span class="populated place">Protorosario</span>, which means <span class="building">Rosario Port</span>, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their <span class="spatial object">horse wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="666">We drove 60 kilometers <span class="region">inland</span> to this new place which we had acquired. </sentence><sentence id="667">There were no <span class="building">buildings</span> on this place. </sentence><sentence id="668">It was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="669">It was just wild <span class="env feature">woods</span>...uh...<span class="env feature">plains</span>, <span class="env feature">swamp</span>, and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build <span class="building">houses</span>, we children stayed with the Mennonites in their <span class="building">schools</span>, in their <span class="building">homes</span>...I think again for at least 1 or 2 months. </sentence><sentence id="670">And then finally we could all move up to the <span class="populated place">Primiwara</span>, and start our community life again. </sentence><sentence id="671">As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="672">In <span class="country">Switzerland</span> were scrapped and they went to <span class="country">Germany</span>, they started from with nothing, with the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, and the left that, went to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. </sentence><sentence id="674">Now in <span class="populated place">Primawara</span>, we started building <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">Uh...In that <span class="country">country</span>, there is a lot of timber, so we had to get timber. </sentence><sentence id="676">You cut the <span class="env feature">trees</span> yourself. </sentence><sentence id="677">You can't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="678">You cut the <span class="env feature">trees</span> in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="679">You bring them out what they call , which is a contraption consisting of two enormous wheels 6 feet high, big wheels with an axle, pulled by 12 oxens and the <span class="spatial object">log</span> maybe  1 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then you cut it up by hand. </sentence><sentence id="680">You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="681">We built four big <span class="interior space">halls</span>, a <span class="dlf">roof</span>, no <span class="dlf">walls</span>, no <span class="dlf">interior walls</span>, and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better <span class="building">housing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">We started right away with agriculture, which is basically all we knew. </sentence><sentence id="683">We start with <span class="building">tannery</span>, <span class="building">wooden tannery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="684">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, there's some wonderful <span class="env feature">woods</span>, exotic <span class="env feature">woods</span>, which make beautiful <span class="spatial object">vases</span>, <span class="spatial object">sugar bowls</span>, <span class="spatial object">candle holders</span>, things like that which people buy. </sentence><sentence id="685">So we went into <span class="building">tannery</span> and agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="686">We started our own <span class="building">school</span> there, and I remember that there were 3 <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">It's hot in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="688">It's <span class="region">sub-tropical country</span>, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100, very humid. </sentence><sentence id="689">Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather. </sentence><sentence id="691">So in this place called <span class="populated place">Priawara</span>, there were three <span class="env feature">wood islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="692">The first one...the first one we cleared and built a <span class="interior space">dining room</span>, <span class="interior space">communal kitchen</span> and a <span class="building">store house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the <span class="building">preschool</span> and the <span class="building">kindergarten</span> (clearing throat) and in the third one we cleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the <span class="env feature">cactus</span> on the brush, and then we...there we built some <span class="building">school houses</span>, <span class="interior space">school rooms</span>, where all the children were educated. </sentence><sentence id="694">We had our own teachers which we always wanted. </sentence><sentence id="695">We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values. </sentence><sentence id="696">Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a <span class="building">school</span> to be...uh....wholeheartedly going in one direction. </sentence><sentence id="697">So this we had our own <span class="building">school</span> with our own teachers. </sentence><sentence id="698">It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already. </sentence><sentence id="699">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span> we stayed til 1960. </sentence><sentence id="700">I lived there for 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="701">I also lived part of my life in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>, and also a <span class="country">country</span> in <span class="region">South America</span>, Montediveo.(Clearing throat) While we were in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, there were some revolutions. </sentence><sentence id="702">There're always revolutions somewhere going on. </sentence><sentence id="703">And we were on the...on the <span class="dlf">battle line</span>...uh...different parties winning and losing. </sentence><sentence id="704">They always asked us to help them supply <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="705">We always refused this. </sentence><sentence id="706">If a soldier's hungry, we give him food. </sentence><sentence id="707">If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way. </sentence><sentence id="708">And this was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="709">My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. </sentence><sentence id="710">But I feel that by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. </sentence><sentence id="711">If one starts compromising, it gets...one gets on <span class="env feature">slippery ground</span> very fast.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="927">Q: What was the government's reaction... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="929">A: The <span class="building">Paraguayan government</span> was...is a <span class="building">Catholic government</span> complete. </sentence><sentence id="930">The whole <span class="country">country</span> is Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="931">They took us in because they needed people on the...on the <span class="env feature">land</span> working agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="932"><span class="country">Paraguay</span> is a <span class="country">country</span> which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a big war with <span class="country">Bolivia</span>, <span class="country">Argentina</span> and <span class="country">Brazil</span>, and they lost enormous amount of people there, especially men and boys. </sentence><sentence id="933">So they needed people to come to the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="934">Not business people in the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, but on the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="935">And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious freedom. </sentence><sentence id="936">We were not Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="937">They gave us complete authority in our <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="938">No policeman had any business there. </sentence><sentence id="939">They gave us freedom of <span class="building">school</span>...of teaching children  2 how we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. </sentence><sentence id="940">And this...this was...this made us very happy that this was possible. </sentence><sentence id="941">So the government was very friendly in that way. </sentence><sentence id="942">And we worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="943">We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and this <span class="building">tannery</span> and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the <span class="country">United States</span>, which helps <span class="country">third world countries</span> improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans. </sentence><sentence id="944">Different things like that. </sentence><sentence id="945">They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists amongst members, and so they had a <span class="building">station</span> on our <span class="region">land</span> where they experimented to improve peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="946">So we worked with them, and that also helped us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="947">In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. </sentence><sentence id="948">The cows were all wild cows. </sentence><sentence id="949">They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="950">So we needed to improve the <span class="spatial object">dairy</span>, and this took year but it got improved eventually. </sentence><sentence id="951">For us children, it was actually a nice time. </sentence><sentence id="952">We never suffered hunger. </sentence><sentence id="953">We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. </sentence><sentence id="954">We had beans. </sentence><sentence id="955">This is fine. </sentence><sentence id="956">One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="957">We had the <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="958">We were cared for. </sentence><sentence id="959">There was a lot of sickness at first. </sentence><sentence id="960">Eye diseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. </sentence><sentence id="961">All these things happened. </sentence><sentence id="962">But...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it possible to get over this time. </sentence><sentence id="963">Now, the...the <span class="building">school</span> was all in...in English I think. </sentence><sentence id="964">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="965">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, we spoke only German. </sentence><sentence id="966">In <span class="country">England</span> we switched over from German and English. </sentence><sentence id="967">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish, so I grow up in three languages. </sentence><sentence id="968">That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little wobbly as Pooh Bear would say. </sentence><sentence id="969">So we had this <span class="building">school</span> there, and we had 9 years of <span class="building">school</span> to the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the <span class="populated place">community</span>, to go to <span class="building">public school</span>, to go to <span class="building">high school</span> but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. </sentence><sentence id="970">So he and I went to <span class="populated place">Ascuncion</span>, the <span class="populated place">capitol</span>, where some other people were studying to be teachers. </sentence><sentence id="971">Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. </sentence><sentence id="972">We went there to what's called the <span class="building">Kindergrotto</span>, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the <span class="building">primary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="973">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, they...I think they use a French system. </sentence><sentence id="974">Six years primary education, six years <span class="building">high school</span>, and then six or seven years <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="975">That's how the system works. </sentence><sentence id="976">So we were quite old,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto. </sentence><sentence id="977">We didn't know any Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. ( </sentence><sentence id="978">Laughing) Even in the <span class="building">State-run schools</span>, they hardly had any...any...uh...<span class="spatial object">notebooks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. </sentence><sentence id="980">I remember writing everything down as fast I could. </sentence><sentence id="981">They speak very fast, and then I went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="982">He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the <span class="populated place">community</span> who was studying to be a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="983">He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later. </sentence><sentence id="984">And I stayed in this <span class="populated place">community</span> in the...the <span class="building">Bruderhof house</span> as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education. </sentence><sentence id="985">This <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> served a number of functions. </sentence><sentence id="986">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span> you can't just.. uh...order something and <span class="building">UPS</span> brings it. </sentence><sentence id="987">It doesn't work like that. </sentence><sentence id="988">It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the <span class="building">capitol</span> and then you had to organize transport from the <span class="building">capitol</span> to the <span class="populated place">colony</span>. </sentence><sentence id="989">And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. </sentence><sentence id="990">Everything had to be bought in the <span class="building">capitol</span> and then transported to the <span class="populated place">colony</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1053">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They're changing tapes. </sentence><sentence id="1055"> 3 End of Tape #1  4 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1059">A: So this <span class="building">house</span> which we had in..uh...in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, the <span class="populated place">capitol</span>, was a <span class="building">building</span> which we rented and later bought. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to <span class="building">secondary school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span> and maybe could be compared to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1061">We also had some people there. </sentence><sentence id="1062">We had a...<span class="building">store</span>, where we sold tanned goods from the...from the <span class="populated place">community</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these. </sentence><sentence id="1065">We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And this <span class="populated place">capitol</span> also, all the business was transacted. </sentence><sentence id="1067">As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Cloth. </sentence><sentence id="1069">All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this <span class="populated place">colony</span> which we had. </sentence><sentence id="1070">To get from <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span> to the <span class="populated place">colony</span> took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day. </sentence><sentence id="1071">One night traveling with a little <span class="spatial object">river boat</span>, maybe...yeah..to and then a day's travel with a <span class="spatial object">horse wagon</span> from the <span class="dlf">port</span> to the <span class="populated place">colony</span>...to the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1072">While being in..in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, I remember a time of revolution which happened every now and then and there was wild shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1073">They have...uh...metal <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> on <span class="dlf">power poles</span>, sheet metal and you could...they were like sieves sometimes at the end of these revolutions. </sentence><sentence id="1074">You know the bullets going right through them. </sentence><sentence id="1075">This all made me...made one remember the times of <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="country">England</span>, so this kind of thing went on. </sentence><sentence id="1076">We...I stayed in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, together with the other people for the whole school year, because things started in January and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my family in the <span class="populated place">community</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Another important thing that...that happened to us was since we had three doctors on the pharmacists and the helper on the <span class="building">pharmacy</span> who came with us to <span class="populated place">Primaware</span>, this <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, when the...when the surrounding neighbors found out that we had three doctors, they came flocking because there was not a doctor in a hundred miles circumference. </sentence><sentence id="1078">They had no where to go with their disease and there's plenty of tropical diseases there. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Leprosy, __, hookworms. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I tell you it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1081">So these people all came for help. </sentence><sentence id="1082">We...we did what we could, but also lacked help. </sentence><sentence id="1083">So very early in the game, then we sent people to <span class="region">North America</span>, brothers and sisters to go to visit big pharmacological places here in the <span class="country">States</span> and beg for medical equipment, medication, money, whatever to start to help these people down there. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And bit by bit we built a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1085">I think at the highest point it had maybe 30 or 40 <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1086">The doctors did all kinds of operations. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Uh...People came when the children were born, hookworm treatment...uh...Saturday night brawls. </sentence><sentence id="1088">All this kind of thing came to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, and we did what we could. </sentence><sentence id="1089">We asked payment insofar as the people could...could pay, but I don't think we ever insisted. </sentence><sentence id="1090">We didn't go to <span class="building">court</span> to demand payment. </sentence><sentence id="1091">That we never did. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Some people paid with eggs or a pig or a cow, but we have to realize that in <span class="country">Paraguay</span> the people living in the <span class="country">country</span> are very poor. </sentence><sentence id="1093">They don't have any money. </sentence><sentence id="1094">They have very few things. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And so we just helped basically. </sentence><sentence id="1096">We just helped. </sentence><sentence id="1097">But food...sending people to the <span class="country">United States</span>...the people coming here found other people interested in a different way of life where the rat race is cut out. </sentence><sentence id="1098">You know running after money, spending it, having to spend it. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Day and night keeping going ...and this kind of frenzy some people didn't want anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And they were looking for a different way of life altogether. </sentence><sentence id="1101">So when we sent people up there, they met some who were interested and they came to visit us in <span class="country">Paraguay</span> which is very important because we were very isolated in  5 the <span class="country">country</span>, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation. </sentence><sentence id="1102">That is not our purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together. </sentence><sentence id="1104">That this is possible right now. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And we are... am not better than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it...where do I say stop? </sentence><sentence id="1107">And living in <span class="populated place">community</span>, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. </sentence><sentence id="1108">This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1110">We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible. </sentence><sentence id="1111">To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="1112">To bums to rich men. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And so when these people came from <span class="region">North America</span>, they asked many questions. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Why you do this? </sentence><sentence id="1115">Why you this? </sentence><sentence id="1116">And this is good for us. </sentence><sentence id="1117">We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And so this was good. </sentence><sentence id="1119">In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the <span class="country">States</span> traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. </sentence><sentence id="1120">There was an intentional community movement in the <span class="country">United States</span> in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Why don't you start a <span class="populated place">community</span> up here?" </sentence><sentence id="1122">So in 1954, we started a <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="region">New York State</span> near...between <span class="populated place">Kingston</span> and <span class="populated place">Poughkeepsie</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">There's a little <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Roseton</span>, near <span class="populated place">Newport</span>, and there we bought some <span class="region">land</span> and some <span class="building">houses</span> and started <span class="building">Hutterian Bruderhof</span> where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good. ( </sentence><sentence id="1124">Clearing throat) Now back to <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1125">I went to <span class="building">school</span> and then I went to <span class="building">University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. </sentence><sentence id="1127">And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the <span class="building">university</span> and <span class="region">South American</span> altogether and also in <span class="country">Paraguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1128">The students are active social movement. </sentence><sentence id="1129">They...the young people protest injustice, the political oppression. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you know, ina stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. </sentence><sentence id="1131">But one day the police came and closed the <span class="building">university</span> down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. </sentence><sentence id="1132">They called it communists. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And...uh...so the closed the <span class="building">university</span> down and the Brother decided that I should go to <span class="populated place">Montediveo</span> in <span class="country">Uruguay</span> to continue with the studies. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And so I went down there and finished up later on. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And it was in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>, the little <span class="populated place">community</span> called there called <span class="populated place">Eldorado</span>, about 10 miles out of <span class="populated place">Montediveo</span>, where the...where we started another little community. </sentence><sentence id="1136">It started just with a few people working in a <span class="building">dairy farm</span> and then we felt it's better not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. </sentence><sentence id="1137">We bought, I think, maybe 20, 30 <span class="env feature">acres</span> with some <span class="building">housing</span> on it. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We sent families down there. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Because we wanted to be near..near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet people. </sentence><sentence id="1140">We didn't want to live for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And also in <span class="populated place">Ascunion</span>, we didn't find enough places for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="populated place">Elarado</span>, near <span class="populated place">Montediveo</span>, <span class="country">Uruguay</span> was supposed to be another <span class="building">center</span> for young people to go to and train. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Maybe I should say at this point that in our <span class="populated place">community</span> we, the children born into the <span class="populated place">community</span> are not members. </sentence><sentence id="1143">There's no automatic birthright membership. </sentence><sentence id="1144">The young people they are born there. </sentence><sentence id="1145">They grow up and we try to give them as good education as we can which varies. </sentence><sentence id="1146">In <span class="country">Paraguay</span> it was very limited. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Here in the <span class="country">States</span>, we're very grateful for the education into <span class="building">high school</span> which is free of charge. </sentence><sentence id="1148">But this wasn't so in  6 <span class="country">Paraguay</span>, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. </sentence><sentence id="1149">They get to know what this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience how other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to say, and come to a personal decision. </sentence><sentence id="1150">If you want to join in the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, it cannot be for..for the parents" sake. </sentence><sentence id="1151">It cannot be for brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1152">It can't be for a good life which we now have. </sentence><sentence id="1153">We have a good life now. </sentence><sentence id="1154">It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. </sentence><sentence id="1155">It can only be for the sake to show the people can live together. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And we found that if we do what Jesus said, it happens. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Now, I want to go back to the time in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1158">When my father and I and a group of others visited <span class="country">Israel</span> in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come up and there our Jewish friends asked, "What do you think of the Holocaust?" </sentence><sentence id="1159">And my father answered after a moment of silence...I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="1161">He said, "The Holocaust is a judgment on the Christians. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians. </sentence><sentence id="1163">Catholics and Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And I know that Jesus did not say kill your enemy. </sentence><sentence id="1165">He didn't even say kill the handicapped. </sentence><sentence id="1166">He didn't say kill the imbecile, the mentally handicapped. </sentence><sentence id="1167">He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God himself. </sentence><sentence id="1168">So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in <span class="country">Israel</span> and <span class="populated place">kibbutz Hasara</span> in 85, "It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they were." ( </sentence><sentence id="1169">Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, "But if we Christians and you Jews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come that takes all of us." </sentence><sentence id="1170">And I think the present day world situation is just about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1285">Q: Have you been back to <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1287">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I went back in 88 once. </sentence><sentence id="1289">We had gone again to <span class="country">Israel</span>, invited by the kibbutz movement to visit them. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And I remember going to the <span class="building">train station</span> there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. ( </sentence><sentence id="1292">Crying) So I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="1293">We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. </sentence><sentence id="1294">So this was the answer my father gave about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Now for the last few...since | year we have started a community in <span class="country">Germany</span> again in <span class="populated place">Bernba</span>, near <span class="populated place">Frankfort</span>, in the . </sentence><sentence id="1296">And we went to this...we went to this <span class="populated place">village</span> and we bought a <span class="dlf">property</span> which used to belong to the <span class="building">Catholic CHurch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1297">It was a <span class="building">children's home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1298">It was very well suited to community life. </sentence><sentence id="1299">It had plans for three or four more big <span class="building">buildings</span>, <span class="building">community-type buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And so we bought this <span class="dlf">property</span> and then a resistance developed from the inhabitants of this small <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Bernba</span>, 400 people maybe, which was so...uh...strong against us coming and against us extending that a Lutheran...Angelical minister in <span class="populated place">Bernba</span> said publicly in a <span class="building">church</span>, "Have we forgotten what happened 50 years ago? </sentence><sentence id="1301">That we are so antagonistic and hateful to people who are not fit into our system?" </sentence><sentence id="1302">She was referring to 1937...uh...to the whole Nazi time where foreigners, Jews...uh...second class citizens were simply hated and exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1303">She...she said, "Is...are we there again? </sentence><sentence id="1304">Have we not learned?" </sentence><sentence id="1305">There was a real confrontation there and we..we don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We invite the neighbors to come and see and talk. </sentence><sentence id="1307">We sing together, but there is a real little <span class="dlf">circle</span> there that wants to get us out of <span class="populated place">Bernba</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1308">This caused an uproar in the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Television companies came and made, you know, <span class="spatial object">televisions</span> and...uh...programs which were broadcast all over <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1310">So we think again this attack on us in the end served something good. </sentence><sentence id="1311">People hear about the brotherly way of  7 life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1337">Q: Is the <span class="populated place">community</span> still in existence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1340">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, we are still holding on. </sentence><sentence id="1341">We don't know how to go, but we're still holding on. </sentence><sentence id="1342">We have no permission to build. </sentence><sentence id="1343">We have no...we can't do a thing because the village authority hasn't given permission yet. </sentence><sentence id="1344">But we hope it will mellow. </sentence><sentence id="1345">We heard that the place we bought in <span class="populated place">Bernba</span> was a real <span class="building">Nazi center</span> for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit is still there. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by killing the people who represent it. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or two days ago. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I don't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving. </sentence><sentence id="1349">And this is...this is what we think all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And it...on the ____ <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, I remember that the brotherhood which we called the Committed Members, they wrote letters to Hitler, to Goring, to the Gestapo, to the Nazi officials in <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>, stating our situation very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="1351">We respect the government. </sentence><sentence id="1352">We are not intending to overcome it with violence, but we can have nothing to do with certain values they uphold. </sentence><sentence id="1353">So we want to love the enemy, but without killing him, without hurting him. </sentence><sentence id="1354">This is...this is what we aim for. </sentence><sentence id="1355">But this is a struggle for every person. </sentence><sentence id="1356">I...[ can be committed to a goal, but it still is harder for me to work towards, because I'm just a humanbeing. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So here I digressed a little. ( </sentence><sentence id="1358">Clearing throat) Now, let me think a moment. </sentence><sentence id="1359">So we started a <span class="populated place">community</span> in the...in <span class="region">North America</span> and we...(clearing throat) in 1960, then we decided to close down all the <span class="populated place">Paraguayan communities</span> and all come up to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1360">We went through a difficult time in our <span class="populated place">communities</span> which I maybe can explain best by saying our Hutterian forefathers from the 16th Century compare a <span class="populated place">community</span> to a <span class="spatial object">lantern</span>, a glass lantern with a candle in the middle like they used to have. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And the <span class="populated place">community</span> is a <span class="spatial object">lantern</span>, but the important thing in the <span class="spatial object">lantern</span> is the light in the <span class="spatial object">lantern</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1362">The <span class="spatial object">lantern</span> serves only to let the light shine out. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And this light for us is Jesus as love, justice and unity. </sentence><sentence id="1364">That is the light. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And we lost this light. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And...uh..(clearing throat) so the things that destroy community life---self-will, selfishness, egotism, huddling, back biting--all these things that destroy community life came in. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And in 1960, we went through a time where we (clearing throat) everyone was faced with the question what do I want with my life? </sentence><sentence id="1368">Do I want to serve love or do I want to serve myself? </sentence><sentence id="1369">And on this then (clearing throat) a large number left us. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And the rest we came together in <span class="region">North America</span> here, and then we started the <span class="populated place">community</span> in Connecticut in <span class="populated place">Norfolk</span>, <span class="region">Connecticut</span> and that's the <span class="region">northwestern corner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And we were...we bought an old place...it is a <span class="building">castle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1372">We don't like <span class="building">castles</span>, but this was a place where a hundred people could find <span class="building">lodging</span> right away. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And so we bought this place and 50 acres and in a feel for different groups, we moved up from <span class="country">Paraguay</span> to <span class="region">North America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Because we needed to...together to find the way to work for the values we had set. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And as humanbeings, we have goals but we always liable to...to move either to the left or to the right and lose the way, but we are determined to find it. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And so that's why we came together in <span class="region">North America</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1377">While in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>, I met my future wife, Elana. </sentence><sentence id="1378">She was there studying music. </sentence><sentence id="1379">She's part...she's a daughter of the family of the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1380">She came down to study music, and we got engaged down there. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And we were engaged for 3 years, because it was in this...this whole time that we closed one <span class="populated place">community</span> after the other and moved up to the <span class="country">States</span> so there was  8 no time for a marriage. </sentence><sentence id="1382">But when she came up in January 1962...1 came up in November 1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and the whole <span class="populated place">community</span> because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And so we married in June... 24th of June 1962. ( </sentence><sentence id="1385">Clearing Throat) We had a...it was a wonderful occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1386">Then we had two children in <span class="region">Connecticut</span> and then we were asked to move to our <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span> which had also started. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Maybe I should say here that (clearing throat) when we decide free willing...when I decide free willingly to become a member of this <span class="populated place">community</span>, I declare my readiness to serve wherever it's needed. </sentence><sentence id="1388">So I can work in the <span class="building">shop</span> making toys for children. </sentence><sentence id="1389">I could clean <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I could work in the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Where...wherever I'm needed. </sentence><sentence id="1392">I don't want to fulfill my gifts specially. </sentence><sentence id="1393">I'm here to serve. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And so in this sense my family moved to the <span class="populated place">Pennsylvania community</span>, and I worked there in the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I worked in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And then in 1972, we moved again to the <span class="populated place">Connecticut community</span> 1973 to be with my father, my mother, and the parents of my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1397">They were getting older. </sentence><sentence id="1398">My father-in-law, and so we...we came together to support them as children in this time. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So now, what else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
