<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: And you family was a part of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Oh very much part of that. </sentence><sentence id="116">My parents were both raised in <span class="building">orthodox Jewish homes</span>, my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="117">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="118"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mother in <span class="country">Germany</span> and my father in in <span class="country">Holland</span>, but uh my father rebelled very early uh against orthodox Judaism so altho...although I'm not quite sure - we kept the kosh..., my parents kept a kosher <span class="building">home</span> but I'm not sure whether it was mostly for their uh sake as it was for my grandfather's sake who was raised and had lived all his live in an orthodox family. </sentence><sentence id="119">But definitely part, strong part of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Uh do you have any recollections of the beginning of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="130">I do. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh I was four and the the the strongest recollection is when the Germans invaded because what happened was that we were told that they were going to bomb <span class="populated place">Breda</span> and so all of us, and that was Jews, non-Jews, uh were told to leave <span class="populated place">Breda</span> and my brother was hospitalized - he had a middle ear infection - and my mother was frantic because we were all told to leave. </sentence><sentence id="132">My mother was absolutely frantic, was trying to get him into a <span class="building">hospital</span> and they were told that they had to keep the <span class="building">hospitals</span> empty for the wounded that were expected, so all of us, uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt, my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us, so it was a hugh family. </sentence><sentence id="133">My my grandfather who was oh 80 years, uh five small children - by that time my baby sister was born - five small children, uh the oldest of whom was seven, my parents, my aunt and her daughter, all had to leave <span class="populated place">Breda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="135">We were, we had to walk - we walked about I would say between twenty and thirty kilometers along a <span class="dlf">road</span> uh trying to find <span class="dlf">farms</span> where we could stay and I remember being strafed --the bombs, the Germans would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="136">And uh there were seventy people killed just along that <span class="dlf">road</span> and I remember uh a woman still standing over her <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span>, protecting her baby who was killed. </sentence><sentence id="137">And every time the the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> would come, my aunt, my mother's sister, would pull us aside and and she was particularly fond of me and she'd literally cover me with her body. </sentence><sentence id="138">And then when the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> left then we'd walk again, and I remember stopping at <span class="dlf">farms</span> and the <span class="dlf">farms</span> would be full and finally - I think it was about 28 kilometers - we had walked 28 kilometers - uh getting to a <span class="dlf">farm</span> where they had some <span class="interior space">room</span> and we spent about five days there, sleeping in the <span class="env feature">hay</span>, until the all-clear was sounded and then walking back - the having to walk back we were not strafed - I don't remember being strafed or bombed during that walk back. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh and half way through some <span class="spatial object">buses</span> came and so mothers with children were allowed to go on the <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and so we didn't we didn't have to walk all the way back. </sentence><sentence id="140">And coming back to our <span class="populated place">town</span> and founding, finding the <span class="populated place">town</span> unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war. </sentence><sentence id="141">Uh then ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: When you returned to the <span class="populated place">town</span>, was it already occupied by the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="158">You see at that point the Germans - they they overrun, they overran <span class="country">Holland</span> in five days, so I mean the the Dutch put up a strong resistance but you know, they were not prepared to deal with the masses and then of course the Germans bombed <span class="populated place">Rotterdam</span> as punishment for German, for Dutch resistance. </sentence><sentence id="159">And uh so we were immediately occupied by the Germans and nothing much happened immediately but then my memories of those early years are pretty vague because they they started rounding up Jews - oh first from the <span class="env feature">coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">Now <span class="populated place">Breda</span> is 50 kilometers north of <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and 50 kilometers southeast of <span class="populated place">Rotterdam</span>, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="161">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="162"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I gather they picked up Jews initially from the <span class="env feature">coastlines</span>, so to prevent them from fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="163">That's why I think there were so many Dutch were murd... were massacred - they they just had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="164">They couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="165"><span class="country">Holland</span> was immediately occupied and all <span class="dlf">exits</span> were basically uh closed and so you were trapped in, we were trapped in our own <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And the first memories I have uh I have is of wearing a yellow, having to wear a yellow star and I was four, so I wasn't ready for <span class="building">school</span> yet, but uh I remember that because we wore a yellow star, we weren't allowed to ride the <span class="spatial object">buses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">I remember we weren't allowed to have <span class="spatial object">radios</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to <span class="building">school</span> in 1942, well really it was 1941, uh we couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore and so for a while there was a little <span class="building">Jewish school</span> that they had in a - I remember it was on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span> of a of a <span class="building">building</span> down <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Breda</span>, and going there and sitting in a <span class="interior space">classroom</span> with who knows - twenty other Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="169">And the children just disappearing. </sentence><sentence id="170">I mean one after the other these children just disappeared until that <span class="building">school</span> closed and then my father tried to teach us at <span class="building">home</span> and I think that was in 1942 because Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="171">And and then you know, getting strong messages that that something very bad was going to happen and it was scary and my parents being scared and just fear, fear enveloping the family pretty much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: When you mentioned the children disappearing from the <span class="building">school</span>, were were families at that point being deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="192">That's when they started. </sentence><sentence id="193">They started deporting the Dutch Jews, as I said they uh they started first deporting them from the <span class="region">coasts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't - the reason we we survived is because they didn't get to us until 1942 uh so we lived in <span class="populated place">Breda</span> until 19...until the fall of 1942 uh but had they come had they come to us earlier we would have we would have disappeared too. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh see I have a memory still and this this was how close that it was. </sentence><sentence id="196">My aunt lived in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> we did but in a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of it, and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us, and I can remember, I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our <span class="dlf">doorway</span> in the <span class="building">house</span> that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter, and they were off to a <span class="populated place">Polish war camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">That's what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="198">And they went with a <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span> to the <span class="building">train station</span> where they were sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and of course never came back. </sentence><sentence id="199">And that was the aunt who was very very close to me, my mother's only sister and her daughter. </sentence><sentence id="200">So uh, so they were sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> uh where we would have gone too uh but - oh yeah, because we lived in <span class="populated place">Breda</span> so we were just far enough from the <span class="dlf">border</span> that we were to be picked up later. </sentence><sentence id="201">And uh it just, and these children you know, may have lived on the on the <span class="region">outlying areas</span> of <span class="populated place">Breda</span>, the children, and then of course the <span class="building">schools</span> closed because there were no children really left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: During this period of the of the occupation, uh how did your parents tell you how to behave when you left the <span class="building">house</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Uh, to be very very careful. </sentence><sentence id="216">I mean we wore yellow stars and and the yellow...the way it worked in <span class="country">Holland</span> is that everybody had to have an ausweiss. </sentence><sentence id="217">That was like a passport, and - including us children - and uh in order for us in order for one to have rationing cards you had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="218">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="219"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to have an <span class="spatial object">ausweiss</span>, and Jews had a big J on their <span class="spatial object">ausweiss</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">And, of course, we had to wear the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="221">So you could be stopped at any time and asked for your ausweiss, and if you if you didn't have your ausweiss with you or and you wore a yellow star, you were shot almost you were shot immediately. </sentence><sentence id="222">So what basically happened is we, they didn't let us uh - we were young anyway - but they didn't, they they became extremely protective of us and they didn't let us be out on the <span class="dlf">street</span> by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="223">And when we would go out, it was with my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="224">My grandmother had died in "39 but my grandfather would take us for walks. </sentence><sentence id="225">As a matter of fact that's one of the reasons we were saved. </sentence><sentence id="226">It's just incredible, incredible uh circumstance. </sentence><sentence id="227">When I ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Shoot. </sentence><sentence id="244">Why don't you go ahead and talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="245">We can go back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="250">The uh uh so that that - what happened was that life became totally family-oriented, that uh they first picked up the Jewish men and I - that's another extraordinary situation - that my my mother's father uh had been very very wealthy, and lived in <span class="populated place">Zempelburg</span> [Pol: <span class="populated place">S_polno</span>, or <span class="dlf">S_pdlno Krai_skie</span>] in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">And after the Ist World War, during the 1st World War, had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort, and after World War I when that part of <span class="country">Germany</span> where he lived uh became Polish, and he opted to remain German and he moved to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser. </sentence><sentence id="252">Uh they picked up Dutch men first. </sentence><sentence id="253">They took them, Jewish men first and they took them to <span class="populated place">slave labor camps</span> and my father had sort of been excused a couple of times one because he was head of the Jewish Council, or he was not perhaps not head but he was a member of the Jewish Council, because he had five children, uh and so on, but he had to, he was to report and I can remember it - my mother just being in tears. </sentence><sentence id="254">Well, the day before, the day before my father was to report, my mother, and she is an incredible woman really - she took that Cross of Merit to the Nazi commander of our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and everybody said don't be ridiculous - it's not going to do you any good, and she said look at what my father did for you know the <span class="populated place">fatherland</span>, and he actually acc...he actually excused my father, thanks to her. </sentence><sentence id="255">And again, that saved our lives because without my father we would not have been saved. </sentence><sentence id="256">And the next week, it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week. </sentence><sentence id="257">And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for <span class="building">City Hall</span>, uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have. </sentence><sentence id="258">I remember walking with my with my grandfather of course, but what happened uh he would take us for walks and a man who worked for <span class="building">City Hall</span> knew what was knew what was happening to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="259">By 1942 by the way everybody knew what was happening to Jews, so the the idea that people didn't know and <span class="country">America</span> didn't know, and <span class="country">England</span> didn't know is garbage. </sentence><sentence id="260">Because we knew and we had no radio. </sentence><sentence id="261">And everybody knew. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and uh this man had seen us because he worked for <span class="building">City Hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">He was familiar with what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="264">He had seen my father take us four children for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="265">My baby sister was too little. </sentence><sentence id="266">And he felt so sorry for us because he knew what was going to happen to us, that one day he came to our <span class="building">house</span>, he came to my father's <span class="building">house</span> and he basically said do you want to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="267">My father said no. </sentence><sentence id="268">He said well, why don't you do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="269">My father said what can I do - I've got five small children and an elderly father-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="270">And he said if I, if I promise to help you, will you try and get out, and within a week - and I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="271">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="272"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection remember a significant part of that - uh other friends, Dutch friends had given us names of people who were willing to take in Jewish children, and within a week we disappeared, and it turned out to be just in time, just before the whole family would have been deported to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, because most Jews went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">Uh and what he did is he gave us false passports so the false ausweiss, so as our name was in Dutch "Magnus," uh he gave us authentic passports--because he had access to the blanks--and with new names. </sentence><sentence id="274">And our new name became "<span class="populated place">Wachness</span>." </sentence><sentence id="275">Of course, Magnus is spelled M - A - G- N- U-S. Wachness was spelled - it sounds the same. </sentence><sentence id="276">So if we would make a mistake, it wouldn't be as noticeable. </sentence><sentence id="277">But the spelling was totally different - it was W- A- C- H-N-E-S-S. And uh and I remember one day we were playing outside and my mother calling us in and saying, children, we want you all to pick a new name. </sentence><sentence id="278">And we had, because Anita is not a common Dutch name - uh we had always pretended we had different names, and I still feel bad about this because my sister Ingrid, the young...one just below me, her her play name had been Leesha (ph), but that's the one I had coveted, and mine had been Lanie (ph) and so when we got to pick new names, I said I want to be Leesha, and I remember Ingrid saying that's my name and I said well I got to be first again. </sentence><sentence id="279">You know, I was the older girl so I got to pick so that's how we picked the new name. </sentence><sentence id="280">My brother's name was Norman. </sentence><sentence id="281">He became Jan. I became Leesha. </sentence><sentence id="282">My sister Ingrid became Lenie (ph) and my other sister Helga became Hennie. </sentence><sentence id="283">And so we got to pick new names and that's that seemed like a big lark to us and then we were called inside, and in the meantime my parents had gotten names of people who were willing to take us - we were called inside and we were told that we were all going to go away. </sentence><sentence id="284">And that we were going to go to strange people, and uh my parents didn't know who they were, but that if we didn't go we would not...we would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="285">And that we were never ever to tell anybody that we were Jewish because that would mean that we would die. </sentence><sentence id="286">And that we would have our new names, we would live with these people, and that the story that they made up was - it's still a peculiar story that we had, we were Dutch but we had lived in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Emden</span>, which is near...it's a <span class="populated place">German town</span> near the <span class="dlf">Dutch border</span>, <span class="region">northwestern Germany</span>, and that when the war broke out we decided we wanted to be in <span class="country">Holland</span> - we didn't want to be, so we basically were refugees from <span class="country">Germany</span> and my grandfather who's who's German, that he was Swiss - uh and uh and because we were refugees we couldn't live with our parents because my parents, our parents were looking for jobs someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="287">And that's why we were, that's why we had to be you know with strange people. </sentence><sentence id="288">That was the story that we were to tell people who would ask us uh you know why we weren't living with our parents. </sentence><sentence id="289">Immediately after that my brother and I were taken away and taken to a family in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> we lived in, and we stayed there for two weeks and uh was, they lived in a <span class="building">house</span> that - and again in <span class="country">Holland</span> because it's so such a crowded <span class="country">country</span>, several families would live in the in the same <span class="building">house</span>, so we lived on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span> of this <span class="building">house</span> and there were another family living on the <span class="interior space">first floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">The family on the <span class="interior space">first floor</span> did not know that we were on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">So for two weeks we could not move. </sentence><sentence id="292">I remember we slept in the <span class="interior space">bathtub</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">We could not talk. </sentence><sentence id="294">We could not move. </sentence><sentence id="295">We couldn't do anything because we were told that if they, the people downstairs would find out that we were <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> we'd be killed. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we, I remember also that sometimes they would take us out twelve o'clock at night just to give us some fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="297">So we'd we'd go outside and that was that was a very hard time because in the mean...you know, we had no idea where our parents This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="298">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="299"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were. </sentence><sentence id="300">I mean there is a six-year old and a nine-year old just taken away, totally, from parents, sisters, and everything else and and, and yet we knew - you know, there was no crying. </sentence><sentence id="301">There was no whining. </sentence><sentence id="302">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="303">There was just obedience. </sentence><sentence id="304">And then after two weeks we were taken by some other people to the middle of the <span class="country">country</span> and we stayed for two years with a magnificent family called the Buchas (ph) in <span class="populated place">Bilthoven</span>--uh, which is a small <span class="populated place">town</span> north of <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span>, which is in the middle of <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">And they ran a very progressive <span class="building">school</span> called the "<span class="building">Werkplatz</span> (ph)," the "<span class="building">work place</span>." </sentence><sentence id="306">She was a daughter of the Cadbury family of the British chocolates Cadbury family. </sentence><sentence id="307">And they were Quakers; and because they ran a <span class="building">school</span>, they took in other children who were not Jewish and so for them to have other children there was not as obvious as it would have been for you know for an ordinary family. </sentence><sentence id="308">So that was a very safe place for us to be. </sentence><sentence id="309">Now we were told never ever ever to tell anybody we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="310">That nobody knew and that we were never to let it be known, and so that was a horrendous burden on us. </sentence><sentence id="311">On me particularly and it's interesting that when my brother's much older, well three years older than I am, I think I was much more conscious of the whole situation than he was and uh and my earliest memory - I think when we we went to <span class="populated place">Bilthoven</span> in in October - no in September of 1942, and again what surprises me in retrospect is that there was no questioning - it was it was real acceptance and real understanding of what was going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="312">There was no question about the fact that if we were discovered we would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="313">I mean that, we lived with that throughout the war, and I also - you know, now when I think about the horror of it, it blows me away. </sentence><sentence id="314">But I'm so grateful we were children because we accepted it - there was none of the the fear of the neurosis, or the neurosis or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="315">There was none of the pathology that that could have induced really uh because we just knew it was going to happen - that that was the way, you know, being very concrete still uh we just accepted that's the way it was and it was scary. </sentence><sentence id="316">Uh my father came to visit us in October; so after months, my father appeared. </sentence><sentence id="317">And it turned out he and my mother and my grandfather had gone to uh <span class="populated place">Limburg</span>, which is in the <span class="region">southeastern part</span> of <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">We tried to go places where nobody knew us. </sentence><sentence id="319">My two younger sisters came about a month later and uh they had gone with my parents to <span class="populated place">Limburg</span> but that was too dangerous, so they they leaved them with another teacher of the <span class="building">school</span> in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> that my brother and I were. </sentence><sentence id="320">And my baby sitter...sist...uh sister Rita went to which is in the <span class="region">western part</span> of the <span class="country">country</span>; though she died of diphtheria in 1943, so I never never saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh but my father came in October; and I'll remember his visit and it was incredible to see him. </sentence><sentence id="322">And he told us that uh he told us that uh our birthdays have been changed. </sentence><sentence id="323">That my brother, whose birthday was November 10th, was his new birthday was January 3rd. </sentence><sentence id="324">And my birthday, which is January 29th, was going to be January 21. </sentence><sentence id="325">And we accepted all that. </sentence><sentence id="326">You know, again, you didn't question - that was the way it was, because it turned out that those were the birthdays that were in our new ausweiss - our new <span class="spatial object">ausweiss</span> which didn't have a J on it. </sentence><sentence id="327">Of course, no J's on our clothes, no no stars on our on our, no yellow stars on our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="328">And uh one of the children of the family we stayed, the Bucha family, I remember saying to my brother, "Norman,"--I mean, "Jan, Jan, what's his name, Jan.

[Phrase missing]...a loving, caring oh unbelievably wonderful woman. </sentence><sentence id="347">When she came <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, I was afraid we were going to be punished, but she she of course didn't punish us. </sentence><sentence id="348">She was very very nurturing and very loving and and seemed to understand why we were crying. </sentence><sentence id="349">But I learned early in the game during the war years uh I learned early that there was something very wrong with who I was. </sentence><sentence id="350">I mean that's probably one of the major lessons. </sentence><sentence id="351">I mean when you look at our lives I mean we were among the most fortunate of all Jews in <span class="country">Holland</span> because we were not, we were out in the open. </sentence><sentence id="352">We were like Dutch children except we didn't live with our parents, and sure we were in danger and it turned out that several times they were very very close to catching us. </sentence><sentence id="353">I'll get in to that in a moment, but when you compare it to most, to most other kids who were, like Anne Frank who was hidden uh for years, you know, and they could not go out and we were infinitely more fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="354">Uh we were out. </sentence><sentence id="355">We were able to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">We, and the <span class="building">school</span> was a magnificent <span class="building">school</span>, very progressive. </sentence><sentence id="357">Uh we had friends. </sentence><sentence id="358">We could play, could breathe fresh air and yet we also knew that, and I knew very intensively uh intensely, that I could be betrayed anytime, and so I learned early in the game that I was not to draw any attention to myself. </sentence><sentence id="359">That I could not, I had to be a very good girl. </sentence><sentence id="360">I could not be naughty. </sentence><sentence id="361">I could not do anything that would make anybody notice me. </sentence><sentence id="362">And so I learned not to complain and I learned not to express any feelings and I learned not to be a bad girl and I learned not to ever This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="363">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="364"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection disobey because anything - I didn't dare do anything that again would make people angry at me because if they were angry at me they might betray me. </sentence><sentence id="365">So it it put this this vice around me, basically, and when I compare that to the little girl who snubbed her father you know I I am aware of what a dramatic impact that war had, uh and at and it was really the most the most poignant memory I have was oh in 1943 I think it was, uh we were riding on what's a bock... (ph)] - it's a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> with a big sort of uh <span class="spatial object">box</span> in front of it and that's how they would transport vegetables and stuff like that - and somebody was riding it and my brother and I were sitting in it, on the edge and I was holding on and then I noticed my brother was not holding on and I of course being you know wanting to be just as brave as he, I decided not to hold on just at the worse possible time as he was going around the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, and I fell off the <span class="dlf">bock</span>...

one hundred percent Catholic - and so as soon as it became known that we were Jewish, we got things like Christ killers, dirty Jews, uh - <span class="country">Holland</span> which really had not known anti-Semitism before the war, the horror of of World War II is that it awakened in <span class="country">Holland</span> I think an awful lot of anti-Semitism, a tremendous amount. </sentence><sentence id="799">And we started encountering that - I mean in retrospect it just blows me away to think that uh there was no debriefing. </sentence><sentence id="800">Nobody ever ever talked to us about what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="801">There was no counseling. </sentence><sentence id="802">There was no support. </sentence><sentence id="803">It was as if we now were, we had to enter a new but it was a foreign society - it wasn't <span class="country">Holland</span> the way we had known it because we became we became dirty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="804">Now not by officialdom necessarily, but the children uh I remember that soon after - because we hadn't gone to <span class="building">school</span> and you know in the meantime you can imagine what our schooling must have been like, uh very interrupted, very sporadic, and the first four years if I had, if 1 went to <span class="building">school</span> two years it was a lot. </sentence><sentence id="805">Uh by the time I was eight, let's see, nine - by the time I was nine I think I had been to <span class="building">school</span> about two years at the most. </sentence><sentence id="806">So my father taught me a lot at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="807">But I remember going to <span class="building">school</span> again after not having been in <span class="building">school</span> for six months or so, and there was a birthday party and we were the only ones who were not invited to go to the birthday party, and my father took us on a big walk and he consoled us. </sentence><sentence id="808">But it was just, see we had to come, we had been non-people, and then we remained outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="809">Uh we stayed in that <span class="populated place">town</span> uh we that we left the family and went and stayed with a woman whose husband had been a a Nazi, and so he was imprisoned and she was forced to take us. </sentence><sentence id="810">Now she was scared of us - she thought that we would, I don't know what she thought we would do, but uh so we lived there you know for a couple of months, because we could not go back to <span class="populated place">Breda</span> because the Germans were still occupying so much of <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="811">And even though <span class="populated place">Breda</span> was also liberated pretty soon after we were in <span class="region">Limburg</span>, uh it still wasn't safe to travel. </sentence><sentence id="812">So uh, we kept on going to - and all the <span class="building">schools</span> were Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="813">I mean, that that again talking about the intense necessity for free...you know, for separation of church and state - uh I'll never forget the experience we had having to go, having no choice but to go to <span class="building">Catholic schools</span>, and and being called Christ killers. </sentence><sentence id="814">Now that only intensified the feelings that the war had fostered in me - the feelings that there was something wrong with me and being a Jew was a bad thing. </sentence><sentence id="815">Uh ashamed of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="816">Uncomfortable being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="817">Uh something that you wanted to hide. </sentence><sentence id="818">It wasn't OK to be who you are. </sentence><sentence id="819">You were different and you know how bad it is for children to be different - I mean how hard it is for them to be . </sentence><sentence id="820">It's bad for kids to be different. </sentence><sentence id="821">It's hard for kids to be different. </sentence><sentence id="822">Uh and so we felt that we never, we just never fitted in and as soon as we could we went back to <span class="populated place">Breda</span> which was not until I think April of 1945, so for about four months we lived very tightly with our family but the best thing was that our family was back together. </sentence></p></dialogue>

so instead of going to a <span class="building">Catholic school</span>, we went to a <span class="building">Protestant school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="926">And again being the outsider was so obvious because of religion. </sentence><sentence id="927">We did not belong in a <span class="building">religious school</span>, and it was uncomfortable and it made us feel uh unwanted. </sentence><sentence id="928">Now we did not encounter there any uh of the anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="929">I mean nobody there called us Christ killers or any of that stuff but we were not accepted either. </sentence><sentence id="930">Well, finally my - the only way you could get a habitable <span class="building">house</span> was by finding a place that people would move out of. </sentence><sentence id="931">And then you had to present it to the Notes Commission, which is the housing need commission and then they would rule on whether you were eligible to move into that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">And several times my mother would find a place and we would never get it and it would, the situation got to be pretty desperate. </sentence><sentence id="933">Well, finally we found a very nice <span class="building">house</span> on the Juliana (ph), and it was uh next to a little <span class="building">office</span> of the <span class="building">conservation company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="934">And we were, and the way that it went was that you had to uh tell the tell the commission where the <span class="building">house</span> was and uh then they would decide. </sentence><sentence id="935">But because they continually took, wouldn't let my mother move into the <span class="building">house</span>, my mother said you know, I'm not going to tell you where it is unless you let me know that I can have it, and they would, she finally was promised that that they could have the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">And we were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="937">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="938"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 assigned that <span class="building">house</span>, and just before we were supposed to move in, the head of that conservation company wanted that <span class="building">house</span> because it was right next to his <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">And again we were, they told that, we were told we couldn't live in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="940">In the meantime you know we lived in an unhabitable, uninhabitable place which was, just made the situation terrible. </sentence><sentence id="941">My mother was alone. </sentence><sentence id="942">She was close to a nervous breakdown I think. </sentence><sentence id="943">She had been so strong during the war. </sentence><sentence id="944">She was, she had crying spells and she was in agony over : It's hard for me to fathom now really she survived as well as she did under the intense kind of suffering. </sentence><sentence id="945">I mean she came back and it was very clear to us that almost our whole family had been wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="946">Her only sister and her...her daughter were wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="947">My father came from a family of seven brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="948">Only he and his oldest brother survived;
