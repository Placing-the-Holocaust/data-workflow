And so anyway they had this problem because they had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their whereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="347">So at that point I went to the and I told that what I had just learned myself and offered my help. </sentence><sentence id="348">He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to have me work with him, but he couldn't pay me. </sentence><sentence id="349">And I said that I didn't need any money, that I had enough to live on in those days. </sentence><sentence id="350">So we had one more letter written up to the Ministry...to the <span class="building">Foreign Affairs Ministry</span> of <span class="country">Hungary</span> which we took over with...uh...<span class="populated place">Sanspritz</span> which...uh... was an official statement that I was a member of the Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on it, and I also got my diplomatic identify card...uh... Since Sanspritz therefore was dealing exclusively with the <span class="building">Foreign Affairs Ministry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">That was his responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="352">Myk responsibility was to deal with the Jewish protection organization. </sentence><sentence id="353">I had the authorization, official authorization to do that. </sentence><sentence id="354">However, I didn't know how to start. </sentence><sentence id="355">Uh...And so I asked around and I asked Attorney Farkosh who unfortunately died the first day that the Russians arrived and that this tragedy and a new tragedy started. </sentence></p></dialogue>

that I have written previously, I wrote down the date as being December 7. </sentence><sentence id="454">I did that to cover <span class="populated place">Sanspritz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">I did that because I wanted to protect him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days more than necessary so that I could protect him. </sentence><sentence id="456">But now I have chosen to tell the truth. </sentence><sentence id="457">However, I can't give you any more details now, because I first have to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="458">I will speak with him tomorrow evening because something happened which disturbed me very much. </sentence><sentence id="459">Something very sad happened. </sentence><sentence id="460">And it was sad because it revealed to

</sentence><sentence id="462">Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one, Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so I was trying to decide what to do. </sentence><sentence id="464">I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal attache or what. </sentence><sentence id="465">But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left. </sentence><sentence id="466">And so I took a walk around the <span class="populated place">international ghetto</span> wondering what I could do and I found myself in <span class="dlf">Lagradi Corroli Street</span>, and I saw that this <span class="building">building</span> was being occupied by the police, so I entered the <span class="building">building</span> and asked what was happening and saw that there were people with <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, a few <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and...uh...the people, the Jews in the <span class="building">house</span> told me that the police want...wanted to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="467">So I decided to lock the <span class="dlf">door</span> and...uh...L...I went to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't do this because the <span class="building">house</span> is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular <span class="building">police forces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">He was not a <span class="building">parliamentary police force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="469">So we came to an agreement. </sentence><sentence id="470">The police agreed to postpone everything for a few days and we went to a <span class="dlf">park</span> where we met with these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police force, <span class="building">Ministry of Interior</span>, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the <span class="populated place">city</span> and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government. </sentence><sentence id="471">I told him that he was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but that he'd went to <span

<span class="country">Spain</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">So the foreign affairs representative agreed to postpone everything by 2 or 3 days which
