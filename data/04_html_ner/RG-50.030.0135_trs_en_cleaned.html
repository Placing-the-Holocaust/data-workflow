Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in <span class="region">Texas</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. </sentence><sentence id="98">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. </sentence><sentence id="99">We had never met. </sentence><sentence id="100">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken. </sentence><sentence id="101">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start." </sentence><sentence id="102">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="103">And (laughter) I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="104">I can't do it tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="105">Give me a couple days." </sentence><sentence id="106">Because, among other things, I didn't have a <span class="spatial object">flight jacket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. </sentence><sentence id="108">You couldn't go up in an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were open. </sentence><sentence id="110">There were no closed <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">That's a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="112">So he taught me to fly in his little <span class="spatial object">piper cub</span> which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...<span class="building">Jewish Welfare Board</span> and the <span class="building">Chief Chaplain's office</span> that I was doing this in case it was of interest. </sentence><sentence id="113">And the <span class="building">Chief Chaplain's office</span> was very interested, they said. </sentence><sentence id="114">So I got my license and...uh...after <span class="building">Chaplain's school</span>, which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force. </sentence><sentence id="115">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!" </sentence><sentence id="116">But...uh...It was done deliberately. </sentence><sentence id="117">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. </sentence><sentence id="119">And so I did go to <span class="country">Europe</span> instead of doing Island hopping in the <span class="env feature">Pacific</span> was what they had been talking about. </sentence><sentence id="120">So | arrived in <span class="country">Europe</span> in...uh...April 1945. </sentence><sentence id="121">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically. </sentence><sentence id="122">I became the radio announcer on the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>...I...on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="124">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner. </sentence><sentence id="125">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="126">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...idea. </sentence><sentence id="127">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way overseas. </sentence><sentence id="128">We also had a...uh... marathon bridge game going. </sentence><sentence id="129">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play <span class="dlf">bridge</span> for money. </sentence><sentence id="130">Never did. </sentence><sentence id="131">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep. </sentence><sentence id="132">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. </sentence><sentence id="133">Several million points were involved in my losses. </sentence><sentence id="134">Uh...I also agreed to...uh...<span class="spatial object">box</span> for the only time in my life, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="135">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before. </sentence><sentence id="137">We sort of sparred around for three rounds. </sentence><sentence id="138">I...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> from <span class="dlf">dockside</span> to an <span class="building">Evac hospital</span> just outside <span class="populated place">Lahov</span> in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized. </sentence><sentence id="140">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back <span class="building">home</span> again because I was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="141">I heard that long after I got into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me. </sentence><sentence id="143">I was in this <span class="building">hospital</span> for 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="144">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> and he and I peddled each night into this little <span class="populated place">village</span> where he had met a French couple, and we played <span class="dlf">bridge</span> in French, which was fun. </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work. </sentence><sentence id="146">So I...uh...was put onto a <span class="spatial object">troop train</span> headed for <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">Typical 40 and 8 <span class="spatial object">box car</span> and I staked out my little piece of <span class="env feature">turf</span> big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to this <span class="spatial object">box car</span> waiting for the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French? </sentence><sentence id="148">Who knows some French?" </sentence><sentence id="149">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?" </sentence><sentence id="150">And he says, "Three words will do. </sentence><sentence id="151">And Colonel needs a French translator." </sentence><sentence id="152">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the <span class="building">transportation corps</span> running these <span class="spatial object">troop trains</span> which didn't require much military skill. </sentence><sentence id="153">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his <span class="spatial object">car</span> which was not a <span class="spatial object">box car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was a heated <span class="spatial object">Pullman car</span> and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped to tear up to the other end to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="156">And he told me, "Signal." ( </sentence><sentence id="157">laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal. </sentence><sentence id="158">I can't go." </sentence><sentence id="159">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="160">I had lots of bad books to read. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had a fine, fine trip into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh...wasn't wanted in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="163">No one knew what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was moved back to a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span> called <span class="populated place">Verea</span>, and...uh...as a casual. </sentence><sentence id="165">I did not have an assignment. </sentence><sentence id="166">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our <span class="populated place">camp</span> which was outside <span class="populated place">Verea</span> into <span class="populated place">Verea</span> to watch the celebration and to celebrate. </sentence><sentence id="167">I was depressed. </sentence><sentence id="168">I didn't feel like celebrating. </sentence><sentence id="169">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="170">I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="171">The world was over, but in the <span class="dlf">square</span> in <span class="populated place">Verea</span>, I saw some men and women in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="172">Clearly! </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. </sentence><sentence id="174">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into. </sentence><sentence id="175">They were <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met. </sentence><sentence id="176">Uh... They didn't want anything. </sentence><sentence id="177">I didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="178">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="180">I did get an assignment to <span class="building">22nd Corps Headquarters</span> in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">Our <span class="populated place">town</span> was <span class="populated place">Hildan</span>, not to far from <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>, and I moved in. </sentence><sentence id="182">Large <span class="region">territory</span>, all of the <span class="region">Rhineland</span>, including <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of troops. </sentence><sentence id="184">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops. </sentence><sentence id="185">I got a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> and went to work. </sentence><sentence id="186">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the <span class="region">area</span> not in <span class="populated place">displaced persons camps</span>, but living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="187">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="188"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection not do. </sentence><sentence id="189">So I began to do three things. </sentence><sentence id="190">First of all to push military government to find <span class="building">housing</span> for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a <span class="building">UNRRA installation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> uniforms, and that was not a very good idea. </sentence><sentence id="192">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together. </sentence><sentence id="193">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say <span class="building">cottage</span>, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say <span class="building">cottage</span>, so we had a short <span class="building">service cottage</span>, and then I said, "Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="194">We need food. </sentence><sentence id="195">Let's go get it." </sentence><sentence id="196">And after the first time in each of these <span class="building">installations</span>, anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>...uh...came with <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and we went to <span class="building">army depots</span> and we got food. </sentence><sentence id="197">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="198">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day. </sentence><sentence id="199">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...1 know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in <span class="country">France</span> in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in <span class="country">France</span>, and had never turned in. ... </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. </sentence><sentence id="201">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. </sentence><sentence id="202">We just stole it. </sentence><sentence id="203">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in <span class="building">depots</span> around the <span class="region">area</span> and...uh...they should be used. </sentence><sentence id="204">And they were. </sentence><sentence id="205">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="206">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. </sentence><sentence id="207">There were socks. </sentence><sentence id="208">There were shoes. </sentence><sentence id="209">There were jackets and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us. </sentence><sentence id="211">Uh... The British were taking over our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">There had been negotiations and most of the <span class="region">Rhineland</span> became <span class="region">British zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was <span class="populated place">Plezn</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">We packed up and we started across <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of <span class="country">Germany</span> that needed doing for me. </sentence><sentence id="216">I went to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">Took a 3 day pass and took my <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> and went down to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh...My reaction to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> to be. </sentence><sentence id="219">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="220">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it. </sentence><sentence id="221">Most of them were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="222">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="223">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them. </sentence><sentence id="224">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a <span class="building">German Army warehouse</span> just by going in, opening the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and taking them. </sentence><sentence id="225">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury. </sentence><sentence id="226">I...uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of <span class="interior space">space</span> it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. </sentence><sentence id="228">On the way to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, we went through <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> cause when we went into the marvelous This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="230">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="231"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection old <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Yana</span>, and into the wonderful former capitol of the <span class="country">German Republic</span> of <span class="populated place">Weimar</span>, I saw smoke. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...<span class="building">crematorium</span> fires, but the fires at the <span class="populated place">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> where there were still people. </sentence><sentence id="233">You could see them. </sentence><sentence id="234">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> without any trouble. </sentence><sentence id="236">We got to <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>, and I settled into my <span class="interior space">room</span>, and to my <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">Uh... Two things happened in fairly short order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest. </sentence><sentence id="238">The other of which transformed my life. </sentence><sentence id="239">I'll do the easy one first. </sentence><sentence id="240">I got a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="241">It was the Bishop of <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>, a Catholic Bishop who told me his name, which I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I said to him, "Sir, I.. (You see he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and he said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="243">You're the Rabbi, aren't you?" </sentence><sentence id="244">And I said, "Yes Sir." </sentence><sentence id="245">And he said, "You're the man I want to come to see, he said, "You don't have to come out here." </sentence><sentence id="246">It was a couple of miles from us to the center of <span class="populated place">town</span> where the <span class="building">cathedral</span> was. " </sentence><sentence id="247">I am coming down this evening. </sentence><sentence id="248">I'll stop in." </sentence><sentence id="249">And I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I met for the first time a bishop who looked like a bishop. </sentence><sentence id="251">You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the whole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="252">Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...it will be a great relief to one of his parishioners if I would go with him. </sentence><sentence id="253">I said, "Alright," and we made a date for the next afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="254">We went into the old part of <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>, which is centuries old. </sentence><sentence id="255">These wonderful 4 and 5 story <span class="building">apartment buildings</span>, which looked like a <span class="populated place">slum</span> on the outside and are often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an engineer, who told me the following story. </sentence><sentence id="256">In the <span class="building">building</span> in which he lived, a neighbor had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">The <span class="building">synagogue</span>, by the way, was still standing. </sentence><sentence id="258">We cleaned it out. </sentence><sentence id="259">It had been made a <span class="building">warehouse</span>, of course, by the Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in <span class="populated place">Plzen</span> during that time. </sentence><sentence id="260">It may still be used. </sentence><sentence id="261">I have no idea. ( </sentence><sentence id="262">Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, became very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist paintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect. </sentence><sentence id="263">In 1938, when the Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "They are going to take our pictures because they want paintings. </sentence><sentence id="264">They steal paintings. </sentence><sentence id="265">Let's hide them. </sentence><sentence id="266">Snyder, being an engineer, was ingenious, and he took his <span class="interior space">living room</span> which was 40 feet long, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="267">One of these <span class="interior space">European saloon-type rooms</span>, and he built a fake <span class="dlf">wall</span> 3 feet in from the regular <span class="dlf">wall</span>, and that <span class="dlf">wall</span> was covered with <span class="spatial object">book shelves</span> and other nice things, with one a typical <span class="dlf">spring door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">He took me inside, and there were all the <span class="spatial object">paintings</span> which they had stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. </sentence><sentence id="269">His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings. </sentence><sentence id="270">If he did not come back, all the paintings would be Snyder's. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh...He also left some books, and that's why the Bishop had taken me. </sentence><sentence id="272">His most precious books. </sentence><sentence id="273">Rabbi Katz was killed in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the books. </sentence><sentence id="274">And I took the books at Snyder's request. </sentence><sentence id="275">An interesting group of 4, 5 books. </sentence><sentence id="276">Not his <span class="building">library</span>, just the books he cared most about. </sentence><sentence id="277">One 2 volume set turns out to be precious. </sentence><sentence id="278">It's now in the rare <span class="interior space">book room</span> of our <span class="building">seminary</span> in <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">It's one of two copies of this 1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...in the whole world. </sentence><sentence id="280">The other one is at <span class="populated place">Oxford</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">Uh... There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to Sylvia. </sentence><sentence id="282">We'll come across <span class="populated place">Sylvia</span> shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New

id="284"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Century, which I gave to the Bishop. </sentence><sentence id="285">And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent <span class="building">home</span> an album of Visidor Kaufman, a prince. </sentence><sentence id="286">Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter of the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East European types. </sentence><sentence id="287">And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are classics. </sentence><sentence id="288">And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of them. </sentence><sentence id="289">That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. </sentence><sentence id="290">The same day there was a knock on my <span class="dlf">door</span> and a little woman walked in, in an <span class="building">American Red Cross</span> uniform. </sentence><sentence id="291">Uh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years older than I, and she told me the following story. </sentence><sentence id="292">She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at <span class="building">Steven Wise Free Synagogue</span>, which was then just called <span class="building">Free Synagogue</span> because Steven Wise was still living. </sentence><sentence id="293">And she had worked for <span class="building">Wises</span>, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise. </sentence><sentence id="294">When <span class="country">America</span> got into the war, he said to her, "You have to go into the <span class="building">Red Cross</span>." </sentence><sentence id="295">And she said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="296">To feed donuts to G.L."s?" </sentence><sentence id="297">And he said, "Yes, because in <span class="country">Europe</span> you are going to be in <span class="region">front line areas</span>, and you are going to be able to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="298">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it." </sentence><sentence id="299">He was right. </sentence><sentence id="300">She was just the type. </sentence><sentence id="301">She got into the <span class="building">Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in <span class="country">France</span>...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> that went to <span class="country">Palestine</span> legally...uh...after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="303">She landed in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="305">And was the director of the <span class="building">Red Cross club</span> in downtown <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">She had four other women working with her. </sentence><sentence id="307">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="308">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the <span class="dlf">back door</span> and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews. </sentence><sentence id="310">Since that's why I went to <span class="country">Europe</span>, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="311">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had been attached to the British army in <span class="country">Italy</span>, had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Trevisio</span>, way up in the <span class="env feature">Italian Alps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent <span class="spatial object">ambulances</span> and they sent <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> over the <span class="env feature">hills</span> into <span class="country">Austria</span> and they began to move Jews into <span class="country">Italy</span> to get on <span class="spatial object">ships</span>, illegal of course, to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and would I help with this <span class="building">enterprise</span>? </sentence><sentence id="314">We could send Jews from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="country">Austria</span> and the <span class="building">Brigade</span> would pick them up and take them to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="316">Cops and robbers! </sentence><sentence id="317">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the <span class="region">American zone</span> of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">Actually, it was out of all of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, because at that point the <span class="dlf">border</span> between the <span class="region">American zone</span> and the <span class="region">Russian zone</span> was an open <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">We were still friendly. </sentence><sentence id="320">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="321">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> I wanted to go for my purposes. </sentence><sentence id="322">And...uh...two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="323">First, Sylvia and I went over to <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">There were 6,000 Jews in the <span class="building">Rothchild Hospital</span> there without a place to go, and new people were coming in all the time. </sentence><sentence id="325">Some from <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">First time I had heard of <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">Others from further East coming West because they had no intentions of living in the <span class="region">East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">Uh...<span class="country">Poland</span> was not a place for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh...They didn't want to live in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">They didn't want to <span class="country">Czech</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">They didn't want to live in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="332">They wanted out. </sentence><sentence id="333">And they would come to a <span class="building">Jewish center</span> hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="334">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection important function. </sentence><sentence id="337">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to <span class="populated place">Abe Klausner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="338">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the <span class="building">Rothchild Hospital</span> to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">From <span class="populated place">Prague</span> to <span class="populated place">Plzen</span> is only about 40 or 50 miles. </sentence><sentence id="340">The only way to get there is by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from <span class="populated place">Prague</span> to <span class="populated place">Plzen</span> for the purpose of looking for relatives. </sentence><sentence id="342">We looked around <span class="populated place">Plzen</span> for the biggest <span class="spatial object">stamp</span> we could find. </sentence><sentence id="343">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document. </sentence><sentence id="344">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into <span class="populated place">Plzen</span> and then take them back to <span class="populated place">Prague</span> because I could travel. </sentence><sentence id="345">And...uh...leave them at our <span class="building">Headquarters</span>, <span class="building">hospital</span> and a new group would come. </sentence><sentence id="346">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. </sentence><sentence id="347">We didn't want large groups taking over <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, so they came in every day. </sentence><sentence id="348">And they reported to us at the <span class="building">Red Cross Club</span> after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the <span class="populated place">Karlov displaced persons camp</span> which was just on the edge of <span class="populated place">Plzen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">It was an <span class="populated place">UNRRA camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="351">I went out to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me. </sentence><sentence id="353">Does the C stand for <span class="populated place">Carnegie</span>?," </sentence><sentence id="354">and he said, "How do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="355">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from <span class="populated place">Pittsburgh</span>." </sentence><sentence id="356">And he said, "Amazing." </sentence><sentence id="357">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman. </sentence><sentence id="358"><span class="populated place">Lipman</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">Is your old man a jeweler?" </sentence><sentence id="360">And I said, "Yal." </sentence><sentence id="361">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him." </sentence><sentence id="362">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his <span class="populated place">camp</span>..We used for transportation to <span class="country">Austria</span> and the answer was <span class="spatial object">U.S. Army trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">And who drove them? </sentence><sentence id="364">U.S. Army personnel. </sentence><sentence id="365">Why did they do it? </sentence><sentence id="366">Scotch. </sentence><sentence id="367">And some money. </sentence><sentence id="368">We did not want people doing us favors. </sentence><sentence id="369">We were commercial. </sentence><sentence id="370">Uh...We made a trip down to the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span> and made the discovery that the only <span class="dlf">bridge</span> across the <span class="env feature">Danu</span>...<span class="env feature">Australian Rivers</span> that we knew about was a <span class="dlf">military bridge</span> and we weren't about to use that. </sentence><sentence id="371">So we went down the <span class="dlf">road</span> looking for a way to get across that blasted <span class="env feature">river</span>, and we found one. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was an old <span class="dlf">dam</span> no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an <span class="spatial object">Army 6-pods</span> to get across with about 6 inches of play on each side. </sentence><sentence id="373">And that's the one we used. </sentence><sentence id="374">We went across the <span class="dlf">dam</span> into <span class="country">Austria</span> and found our way either to <span class="populated place">Lintz</span> or to <span class="populated place">Gratz</span> or to <span class="populated place">Saltsport</span>, depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="375">Others, it worked. </sentence><sentence id="376">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories. </sentence><sentence id="377">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a...I was a Captain by then. </sentence><sentence id="378">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="379">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this... <span class="populated place">Massel</span> is not to be considered a minor thing. </sentence><sentence id="380">The...uh...sergeant in charge of our <span class="dlf">motor pool</span> at <span class="building">Corps Headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">Now <span class="building">Corps Headquarters</span> has a lot of <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">It just does. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh...Corps a big thing. </sentence><sentence id="384">Was a sergeant named Katz, and he was from <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he would get truck drivers for me and <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we would pay with money and Scotch. </sentence><sentence id="385">As I recall, it was 2 <span class="spatial object">bottles</span> per round trip or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="386">But where the Hell do you get Scotch in that kind of quantity?

</sentence><sentence id="423">Red handed! </sentence><sentence id="424">The whole bunch of us! </sentence><sentence id="425">We had not yet transferred these people to the <span

immediately, and I would be court-martialed. </sentence><sentence id="427">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. </sentence><sentence id="428">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="429">He didn't want Jews in his <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="430">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult. </sentence><sentence id="431">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes. </sentence><sentence id="432">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by <span class="building">UNRRA</span> where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">The Jews were not grateful. </sentence><sentence id="434">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived. </sentence><sentence id="435">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out. </sentence><sentence id="436">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together. </sentence><sentence id="437">Some of us understood it. </sentence><sentence id="438">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="439">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have. </sentence><sentence id="440">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything. </sentence><sentence id="441">It was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="442">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not. </sentence><sentence id="443">So General Hubnere said, "Get them out of here. </sentence><sentence id="444">I don't care." </sentence><sentence id="445">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. </sentence><sentence id="446">One incident will illustrate this. </sentence><sentence id="447">He called Sylvia and me in one day. </sentence><sentence id="448">Now I had never met <span

Ben-Gurion always did. </sentence><sentence id="471">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up.

place">Terezin</span>, <span class="region">north</span> and a little bit west of <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="962">So I went there. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="965">It was an <span class="building">army barracks</span>...uh...and wasn't bad, because <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>, I remind you, was the show-off <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="966">That was the place that the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> came to. </sentence><sentence id="967">The <span class="building">International Red Cross</span> was not exactly heroic during World War II, but they would go to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> and make inspection...inspections and then send out a report saying the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> was fine. </sentence><sentence id="968">They had a band and gave concerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="969">What they didn't say is that everyday <span class="spatial object">transports</span> left for the <span

named Beck in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to <span class="region">East</span> instead of Leo Beck. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3500">A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> on a certain date. </sentence><sentence id="3501">The largest <span class="spatial object">transport</span> that had ever been contemplated. </sentence><sentence id="3502">And the people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> did their job. </sentence><sentence id="3503">And it was decided that two of the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> would go by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, by way of <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, and three of them would go by <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up, and do this three times. </sentence><sentence id="3504">Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid- week which we had never done before. </sentence><sentence id="3505">But what're we going to do. </sentence><sentence id="3506">Because we had to get these people on board. </sentence><sentence id="3507">The British were watching this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> in sit where it was, and they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it. </sentence><sentence id="3508">All of these people had to get new

id="3509">They weren't really blank at all. </sentence><sentence id="3510">They had names on them. </sentence><sentence id="3511">They just weren't names of any living people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places. </sentence><sentence id="3512">So we prepared in advance DP cards. </sentence><sentence id="3513">Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military

id="3517">It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of piece." </sentence><sentence id="3518">So they all had to learn them. </sentence><sentence id="3519">And some of the old people had difficulties with this. </sentence><sentence id="3520">Kids had no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="3521">There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox origins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he memorized his name and his <span class="populated place">birthplace</span> and his birth date. </sentence><sentence id="3522">It was nice. </sentence><sentence id="3523">And then we took them. </sentence><sentence id="3524">Normally, when we got <span class="building">Milhouse</span> there was a little <span class="building">hotel</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="3525">A wonderful lady owned it who fed us a hot meal. </sentence><sentence id="3526">This is the staff who had gone on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="3527">The

this time we got there early evening. </sentence><sentence id="3531">We turned in. </sentence><sentence id="3532">Didn't have all that wonderful hospitality. </sentence><sentence id="3533">And in the middle of the night, we got back in our <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days. </sentence><sentence
