<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="159">When the Germans came in, my father...1 mean actually we were...we had no food in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">It was not like here. </sentence><sentence id="161">You had always something in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">In <span class="country">Europe</span>, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the <span class="building">store</span>, and you used to buy. </sentence><sentence id="163">When the war broke out, the <span class="env feature">water</span> was cut off. </sentence><sentence id="164">There was no gas in the <span class="building">house</span> to cook anything. </sentence><sentence id="165">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="166">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of <span class="dlf">streets</span>, there was a <span class="building">factory</span>, they used to produce pickles. </sentence><sentence id="168">A <span class="building">Polish factory</span>! </sentence><sentence id="169">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in <span class="building">tents</span> like...small <span class="building">tents</span>, and large ones. </sentence><sentence id="170">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that <span class="building">building</span> in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it <span class="building">home</span>, and this we lived for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="171">Just on pickles!And once in a while, we got bread. </sentence><sentence id="172">But we had some rice. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we had rice and pickles. </sentence><sentence id="174">And this went on for...for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="175">There were <span class="building">houses</span> burning. </sentence><sentence id="176">I mean it was...to describe a regular This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection hell, because there was no <span class="env feature">water</span> to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go. </sentence><sentence id="179">It just happened the <span class="building">house</span> we lived that nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="180">Like next <span class="building">house</span>, third <span class="building">house</span>, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the <span class="building">houses</span> and look for something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="181">And this kept on for 4 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="182">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="183">New rules. </sentence><sentence id="184">New Regime. </sentence><sentence id="185">They first thing they did, they made a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="186">You are not allowed to walk the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">But still there was no food. </sentence><sentence id="188">So the only thing they did was on the <span class="dlf">corner</span> someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have <span class="interior space">field kitchens</span>, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis. </sentence><sentence id="189">This is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="190">Right when they walked in. </sentence><sentence id="191">I found this it out through a friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="192">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there is a <span class="interior space">field kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something. </sentence><sentence id="194">I remember like now I took my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="195">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already. </sentence><sentence id="196">They occupied the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">We came over there. </sentence><sentence id="198">We saw a <span class="dlf">line</span> of people, and we stood in the <span class="dlf">line</span> for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads. </sentence><sentence id="199">When I got to the <span class="dlf">line</span>, a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude." </sentence><sentence id="200">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="201">He's a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="202">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="203">So he chased us away. </sentence><sentence id="204">So when he chased us away, we stood again. </sentence><sentence id="205">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things. </sentence><sentence id="206">So we had to go <span class="building">home</span> without bread and without anything. </sentence><sentence id="207">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>, from the <span class="env feature">river</span>; and this is like 4 miles. </sentence><sentence id="208">So we took 2 pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="209">Me and my sister took 2 pails of water, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="210">We carried the pails so when we had to pass by a <span class="populated place">Polish neighborhood</span>, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back. </sentence><sentence id="211">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">Still the hatred. </sentence><sentence id="214">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="215">For no reason at all! </sentence><sentence id="216">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do. </sentence><sentence id="217">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water. </sentence><sentence id="218">So this went on for a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="219">You know with that thing. </sentence><sentence id="220">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a <span class="dlf">street</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, the Nalevki. </sentence><sentence id="221">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot. </sentence><sentence id="222">I don't know how or why. </sentence><sentence id="223">This is the first time I heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="224">They took out 53 people from that <span class="building">building</span>, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly. </sentence><sentence id="225">This is maybe 2 weeks after they walked in....in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier, how he got shot over there, and this was in the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span>, you know, and they took out 53 people and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="227">And since then everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that <span class="populated place">District</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">Now what happened to our place is that the German's find out about my grandfather's <span class="building">factory</span> and the <span class="building">store</span>, so every day you see <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came in and they loaded up. </sentence><sentence id="229">They cleaned out little by little everything. </sentence><sentence id="230">My father and my grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">Not much because you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="232">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="233"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection couldn't grab too much. </sentence><sentence id="234">And little by little, they cleaned out the <span class="building">warehouse</span>, they cleaned out the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">They took away the <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">Everything they loaded up in <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and I don't know where they had it. </sentence><sentence id="237">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that <span class="building">factory</span>, we lived awhile. </sentence><sentence id="238">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know. </sentence><sentence id="239">And after...this was around 1941...1942. </sentence><sentence id="240">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed in. </sentence><sentence id="241">They made a <span class="dlf">wall</span> around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David. </sentence><sentence id="243">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David. </sentence><sentence id="244">And everybody in the <span class="building">house</span> had always ready, uh, how you say a <span class="spatial object">rucksack</span> with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected. </sentence><sentence id="245">That was my father's idea. </sentence><sentence id="246">We don't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="247">First day here, they clean out this <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">They clean out this <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">You walk out in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and they need 100 people to go to <span class="building">work</span>, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="251">When we lived in that <span class="building">building</span>, we lived near a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">One time each <span class="building">house</span> had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules. </sentence><sentence id="253">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="254">So who'll they take? </sentence><sentence id="255">Elderly people, they can't take. </sentence><sentence id="256">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people. </sentence><sentence id="257">And from that <span class="building">house</span> by us, we had to give them 3 people. </sentence><sentence id="258">So each <span class="building">house</span>, like 10 <span class="building">building</span>, used to give 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="259">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away. </sentence><sentence id="260">When they came back, nobody recognized them. </sentence><sentence id="261">Each one was swelling. </sentence><sentence id="262">I remember that I had a friend. </sentence><sentence id="263">His name was Schemick. </sentence><sentence id="264">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="265">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating, from the undernourishment those people had. </sentence><sentence id="266">What did they do? </sentence><sentence id="267">They dig some kind of <span class="dlf">dam</span> in the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">They were standing all day long in the <span class="env feature">water</span> in digging the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and from this they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after they send him <span class="building">home</span> he died because he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="269">And this kept on like this, and my father was still <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">My mother was still <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">My sisters were <span class="building">home</span>, and still we went some...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a <span class="building">school</span> for 3, 4 children. </sentence><sentence id="272">They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had <span class="building">libraries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">We went in the <span class="building">libraries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">We read books. </sentence><sentence id="275">We still think sometime sometime will get better. </sentence><sentence id="276">In the meanwhile, we had...there was a <span class="building">Polish newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">Actually it was a <span class="spatial object">newspaper</span> where the German printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and we read it. </sentence><sentence id="278">We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this. </sentence><sentence id="279">We didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="280">The radios was not allowed to have because they took all the radios from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="281">They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a radio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away. </sentence><sentence id="282">And we didn't have no news actually what happened on the other side of the world. </sentence><sentence id="283">And this went on like this until 1942.42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go <span class="region">Ost</span> [NB: to the <span class="region">east</span>], means for work. </sentence><sentence id="284">And the hunger in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was so great, was so bad, those people were laying on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and dying, little children went around begging, and, uh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry the death people in little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, used to bring them down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and bury them in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="285">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="286"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="building">mass graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to eat. </sentence><sentence id="288">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="289">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations. </sentence><sentence id="290">It's your pot luck. </sentence><sentence id="291">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="292">Finally when they start bringing people out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="293">And if you just register, you want to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="295">They just went and they signed up. </sentence><sentence id="296">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that place, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that place, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads. </sentence><sentence id="297">And they pushed them into the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>; and they pushed in so many people in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> that they actually couldn't eat that bread. </sentence><sentence id="298">There was no <span class="interior space">room</span> even to cut the bread. </sentence><sentence id="299">So what happened. </sentence><sentence id="300">Well, they send them to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> came back with the same bread because in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> and you had <span class="interior space">standing room</span> only. </sentence><sentence id="302">You couldn't even sit. </sentence><sentence id="303">You couldn't even stand. </sentence><sentence id="304">You were just pressed like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="305">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, they had to undress and they had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="306">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">And this went on constantly. </sentence><sentence id="308">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was <span class="building">home</span> and there was, uh, a...a raid. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="317">So she says, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="318">You go hide." </sentence><sentence id="319">So I was hiding in the <span class="building">house</span> and she went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> with my 3 sisters. </sentence><sentence id="320">Everybody was having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with

what to do, what to say. </sentence><sentence id="332">And I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, "Oh, well, and he's going to let him stay." </sentence><sentence id="333">And he tell them to go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">In the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, there was

uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came <span class="building">home</span> and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...L...I can't be here anymore." </sentence><sentence id="345">You

half...every <span class="spatial object">car</span> had half dead people inside. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Like I told you, only young people could have survived. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Only the youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And after this, me and one more guy went over there. </sentence><sentence id="2324">We took our little strength and we says, "We're gonna walk to a <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And we walked in that uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2326">We felt more strength, and I remember like now we came to a <span class="building">house</span> with a German woman inside, and she saw us and she started running. </sentence><sentence id="2327">She run away. </sentence><sentence id="2328">She saw both of us and we wore striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2329">We walked in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2330">What a beautiful <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2331">All kind of china, with <span class="interior space">closets</span> with clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2332">First thing I did I took off my things. </sentence><sentence id="2333">I took out a shirt, and I put on a shirt. </sentence><sentence id="2334">This is the first time in 3, 4 years I had a shirt on my back. </sentence><sentence id="2335">Shoes I couldn't find, but I found a pair of rubber shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2336">I put on the rubber shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And a pair of pants. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And after I saw her looking and I hollered to her, "Come here. </sentence><sentence id="2339">You know what I need some food, you know, to eat." </sentence><sentence id="2340">So she gave us some food. </sentence><sentence id="2341">But I saw her looking outside. </sentence><sentence id="2342">She looked...she looked outside. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I don't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And there was a <span class="building">dog house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And what do you think? </sentence><sentence id="2346">In the <span class="building">dog house</span>, there was a little girl, maybe 4 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2347">She was...she hid. </sentence><sentence id="2348">I went to her and I says, "Do you think I am going to harm you little girl? </sentence><sentence id="2349">Do you think I am going to be just like you people were? </sentence><sentence id="2350">I am not going to harm you, little girl. </sentence><sentence id="2351">You don't have to hide on the <span class="building">dog house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2352">She didn't say a word, you know, when I said this to her. </sentence><sentence id="2353">But this little girl was laying in that <span class="building">dog house</span> hidden because she thought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And the same thing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I couldn't have picked up a rifle and killed all I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2355">I couldn't even move. </sentence><sentence id="2356">I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2357">Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it. </sentence><sentence id="2358">I couldn't even do this. </sentence><sentence id="2359">I couldn't even lift up the <span class="spatial object">rifle</span> that was laying on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> because first of all they are very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="2360">First, in...in...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every <span class="building">home</span> and do anything you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2361">Nobody did those things. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Nobody did any revenging and killing just for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="2363">I don't remember those things. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And I saw people like me...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war. </sentence><sentence id="2365">Nobody did any revenge . </sentence><sentence id="2366">And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2 MPs...Yes...and asked where are we going. </sentence><sentence id="2367">So I told him we were on a <span class="building">field hospital</span> from the army and now we gonna go. </sentence><sentence id="2368">We're looking for friends or family. </sentence><sentence id="2369">You know, do you say, "That's the only thing you had on your mind." </sentence><sentence id="2370">So they say, "You can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="2371">You are not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="2372">No. </sentence><sentence id="2373">You're now allowed to do this." </sentence><sentence id="2374">That was just war time. </sentence><sentence id="2375">You are not allowed to do this. </sentence><sentence id="2376">So they took us, put us in a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span>, and took us away, and point was already more people over there. </sentence><sentence id="2377">And this was that <span class="populated place">Camp Felderink</span>.
