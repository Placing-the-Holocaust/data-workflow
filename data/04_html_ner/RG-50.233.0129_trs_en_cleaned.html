feel you can do it, by all means go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="240">I went with the fellow one night and we wound up there one earlymorning. </sentence><sentence id="241">We went to see some people who used to live there before the war, by the name Boldratt (26). </sentence><sentence id="242">They recommended staying with an elderly person who was handicapped and used a crutch.

for further information about this collection stay in there and feel that the <span class="env feature">elements</span> are not going to be against us. </sentence><sentence id="247">I started going to a <span class="populated place">city</span> by the name <span class="populated place">Bi</span> (64) which was also about 25kilometers from <span class="populated place">Chisava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">That <span class="region">area</span> was called by the Germans, it was not an integrated <span class="region">area</span> that they claimed was their possession. </sentence><sentence id="249"><span class="populated place">Chisava</span> was their possession, Bi _ they claim is a protectorate. </sentence><sentence id="250">They wanted to make the people vote for them in case it will ever come to a vote to show that they are willing to stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="251">That's why they're called <span class="populated place">protectorate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">Germans were hoping that eventually the public was going to be voting for them to remain over there. </sentence><sentence id="253">I went over to that <span class="populated place">city</span> and I had my father's cousin by the name Russik (76) and we were told that sugar is in abundance over there. </sentence><sentence id="254">You can get as much as you want. </sentence><sentence id="255">We figured out that I'm going to go, that my friend Bro (80) will stay in the place, justin case something, a message or something else, someone will have to be there. </sentence><sentence id="256">The first trip we had to cross a <span class="dlf">border</span> and it was uneventful. </sentence><sentence id="257">It didn't bother us at all, we just slipped through the <span class="dlf">border</span> and the Russiks were very nice and they accommodated me and helped me also to find the sugar that Ineeded. </sentence><sentence id="258">I spent maybe three or four days over there just to get a little rest and then I started on the way back. </sentence><sentence id="259">The way back was a little harder. </sentence><sentence id="260">We had to hire somebody who would transport the sugar and make sure that that the sugar was not going to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="261">He put some sheep in the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and hid the sugar under that <span class="interior space">double floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">We could not go with him because we were Jews and he was a Pole, and transporting Jews would have caused him problems. </sentence><sentence id="263">I went by myself and a number of other people who would try to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span> with someone who knew the <span class="region">area</span> and also knew when the guards were changing. </sentence><sentence id="264">We made it across the <span class="dlf">border</span> and I met up with that man who was carrying that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="265">He was recommended by Mr. Russik, who knew him from before the war. </sentence><sentence id="266">He said "He is beyond reproach, you don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="267">When you get there, he'll wait for you and he'll have it for you." </sentence><sentence id="268">Sure enough, when I went back to <span class="populated place">Chisava</span>, he told me where he's going to be. </sentence><sentence id="269">There was only one <span class="building">beer joint</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">He said, "I'm going to be in that <span class="building">beer joint</span>." </sentence><sentence id="271">I went over to him and he had that stuff for me. </sentence><sentence id="272">I paid him and I made arrangements that I'm going to use him again next time. </sentence><sentence id="273">My friend Bro and I picked it up and we took it over. </sentence><sentence id="274">People were already waiting for it. </sentence><sentence id="275">Of course, not for money but bartering for other foods. </sentence><sentence id="276">What we wanted mainly was bacon and ham. </sentence><sentence id="277">Those are the items that we are lacking, everybody was lacking. </sentence><sentence id="278">But the farmers had it in abundance. </sentence><sentence id="279">They're putting it away and hoarding it. </sentence><sentence id="280">For the sugar, we got all that stuff that we needed. </sentence><sentence id="281">I took off that stuff that we got and we hid it. </sentence><sentence id="282">A few days later, I had a message that my grandmother was very sick and she was not expected to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="283">I filled a <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> with a number of provisions. </sentence><sentence id="284">My father and my grandmother were very religious and they wouldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="285">But the rabbi told them that if it is a life- threatening situation you are allowed to eat haza (pig). </sentence><sentence id="286">I broughtit over and my grandmother, it was like she waited for me. </sentence><sentence id="287">She was still alive but she didn't last the next night. </sentence><sentence id="288">She justfell asleep and never woke up. </sentence><sentence id="289">We went to the funeral and my parents had some provisions. </sentence><sentence id="290">My father wouldn't eat any of that ham or bacon. </sentence><sentence id="291">My mother and my little brother had it. </sentence><sentence id="292">I didn't
