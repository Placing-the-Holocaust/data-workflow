<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier, the German Jew was first German. </sentence><sentence id="4">I want to tell you a little incident. </sentence><sentence id="5">There was a Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not display their flag. </sentence><sentence id="6">My sister and I would make a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my parents naturally reeled back in again. </sentence><sentence id="7">Just to give you a sample like there was no difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Do you remember much about any friends in <span class="building">school</span> that you had at that time in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, especially from the children if there were any anti-Semitic </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Yes, because they were agitated by their parents. </sentence><sentence id="16">We had to wear a Star of David with the name Jew written in and the letters were made in such a way that they looked like Hebrew, said German Jew, and it had to be worn on the outer clothes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: From what time was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: That started also in the late "30's. </sentence><sentence id="22">I would say "38 and the kids would throw stones, you know kids are cruel and not being allowed to go many places, was a hardship on the kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Do you remember what life was like, we're not talking about a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> here but the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> you moved to, was it guarded by the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Was it free going back and forth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes it was. </sentence><sentence id="32">And even at that time there were plenty Germans who were not Nazis but they were scared not to be Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="33">I remember as a little boy I worked in a little <span class="building">store</span> they were selling health food and I took the deliveries for him. </sentence><sentence id="34">Beautiful people. </sentence><sentence id="35">But I also remember taking the packages to the <span class="building">post office</span>, other kids would tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and causing problems and things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: How did you work at this <span class="building">store</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: It was a little part-time job. </sentence><sentence id="44">After <span class="building">school</span> I worked there. </sentence><sentence id="45">There were Germans that my family knew who befriended us who were strictly against the system. </sentence><sentence id="46">I'll tell you how bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="47">One child remarked in <span class="building">school</span> he overheard his parents the night before saying that some law that Hitler made was ridiculous or, I can't get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man, gentile man, was arrested by the German Gestapo and eight weeks later his wife received an <span class="spatial object">urn</span> of ashes, they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="48">So the kids were scared of their parents. </sentence><sentence id="49">You were not allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts, like <span class="country">England</span> and <span class="country">America</span> were separate, so neighbors would turn other neighbors in that they were listening to foreign broadcasts and they were severely punished. </sentence><sentence id="50">You inquired of what type of <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> it was. </sentence><sentence id="51">Well, it was not a bad <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">The <span class="interior space">living quarters</span> were difficult to find and we didn't live as nice as we did This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="53">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="54"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection before. </sentence><sentence id="55">We didn't starve. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was just a different type of living. </sentence><sentence id="57">We were under pressure all the time like we were an enemy of your own <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">And like I said earlier, a lot of people started to deport, they had enough sense to get out of there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Did a lot of people, were they able to get out? </sentence><sentence id="77">Was it more restricted as time went on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Well, there was a point where Hitler wanted the people to get out. </sentence><sentence id="81">Of course, they had to have visas in order to come to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">They had to be sponsored. </sentence><sentence id="83">So that sometimes created a problem. </sentence><sentence id="84">You had to have someone. </sentence><sentence id="85">They also had Jewish organizations, | think it was HIAS and others that assisted Jews from leaving. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then of course, you had to have a certain amount of money to leave and since my own bank account, my father's bank account was taken over, at that time, it was almost impossible to leave so when we wanted to leave in the late "deg30's, we couldn't leave anymore. </sentence><sentence id="87">My father wanted to go to <span class="country">Australia</span>, that's what he hoped to do but it didn't work out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
