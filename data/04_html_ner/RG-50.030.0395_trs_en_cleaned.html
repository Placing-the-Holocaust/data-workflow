<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: I'd like you to just begin by introducing yourself, and -- and telling us where and when you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Max Heller. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, in 1919. </sentence><sentence id="5">I come from a relatively small family, just a sister, and of course my parents. </sentence><sentence id="6">I grew up in a very <span class="building">Orthodox home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">My parents observed the Shabbas, they would not work on the Sabbath; in fact, they would not even light -- put the light on. </sentence><sentence id="8">In fact, what -- that sort of gives me wonderful memories. </sentence><sentence id="9">My father was more Orthodox than -- than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father had the philosophy that God takes care of everything, and my mother said God takes care of those who take care of themselves. </sentence><sentence id="11">So I'm sort of an in-between. </sentence><sentence id="12">If I lean to anything I lean to, you must take care of yourself rather than -- and my father would run across the <span class="dlf">street</span> against the light because he knew God would take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="13">But it's interesting, that kind of faith helped us when things got very bad. </sentence><sentence id="14">Our <span class="building">home</span> was a very happy <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">We were not wealthy by any means, I would say we were middle income people, both my mother and my father worked. </sentence><sentence id="16">They had their own <span class="building">business</span>, which was a -- a <span class="building">textile business</span>, but they sold to individuals on a credit basis, and they had several salesmen that went out and sold the merchandise and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="17">I -- as I told you, I was brought up Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="18">In fact, I had a Hebrew teacher from the time I was eight years old to prepare me for -- for my Bar Mitzvah, he came to my <span class="building">house</span> three times a week. </sentence><sentence id="19">I remember that teacher, because he taught me a lot, not just the Hebrew part, but also, after the lesson he would sit with me and talk to me about what Judaism is all about, the ethics, the morals, and the stories, and I was fascinated with that. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I would say that today I'm a strong This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Jew, more on the side of the morals and the ethics, and how you're supposed to behave, than the rituals. </sentence><sentence id="23">I -- I have nothing against rituals, I -- I observe but not -- not as much as I -- I try to live like this man taught me, so I'm -- I'm trying to give you a picture of what life was like in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">My sister was two years old than I am. </sentence><sentence id="25">She -- she probably did not experience things the way I did because as a youngster I was involved in a lot of fights because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="26">I experienced a lot more anti-Semitism than my sister did. </sentence><sentence id="27">So it -- in that respect, perhaps we grew up a little bit different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Why would you have experienced more than your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Well, my sister, if there was any -- any anti-Semitic action on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, she certainly would run <span class="building">home</span> rather than get out and fight. </sentence><sentence id="58">So -- so it was a -- really different, she was not exposed as much as -- as I was. </sentence><sentence id="59">And I -- I -- you know, I-I sort of lived through it. </sentence><sentence id="60">I belonged to -- when I got older I belonged to a <span class="building">sport club</span> called <span class="building">Ha-Koah</span>, the word stands for strength, and I was in the <span class="interior space">wrestling section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">So all of these guys -- I was like a mascot. </sentence><sentence id="62">In those days they were really national champs. </sentence><sentence id="63">They didn't shy away from defending yourself. </sentence><sentence id="64">And it's interesting when I think about it now, is what made my Judaism stronger then, and still is today is you cannot shy away. </sentence><sentence id="65">You must face, you must face anti-Semitism, if it exists. </sentence><sentence id="66">You -- you cannot just walk away from it. </sentence><sentence id="67">And even today when I see something that I feel -- and I've been in company of people that say things like, oh, I Jewed him down, as an example. </sentence><sentence id="68">I speak up. </sentence><sentence id="69">And perhaps this goes back to my childhood when I was -- I spoke up, and I defended myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: But what at that point gave you the strength to defend yoursel -- yourself, instead of to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, I -- th-that's a very good question. </sentence><sentence id="85">You know, people say I'm proud to be a Jew, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="88">That's -- but you have to know why you are proud, and | think because of my upbringing, both my mother and father, and then this teacher that I'm talking about, I felt good being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="89">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="90">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="91"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection never -- I never had to shy away, it was something that I was very proud of, but I knew why. </sentence><sentence id="92">And so this, I think, made the difference, it's the upbringing that makes the difference. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="94">Even today I have people that -- I live in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="region">south</span>, and we have a <span class="building">college</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="building">Bob Jones University</span>, and they always send people out trying to convert you. </sentence><sentence id="95">They knock on my <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">And both Trude, my wife and I, when we answer the <span class="dlf">door</span>, we say, you have the wrong address. </sentence><sentence id="97">We are very happy with what we are. </sentence><sentence id="98">Maybe you're happy with what you are. </sentence><sentence id="99">And so this -- you know, it carries forward, there's no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="100">And we -- I think our children feel the same way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="117">You were talking about the fact that your family was very observant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Do you have fond memories of some of those observances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: Probably the happiest time of my life, this may sound ridiculous, when we were the poorest. </sentence><sentence id="125">And this was during the depression, I -- in Europe the depression started perhaps a little earlier than it did in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">But my parents had practically lost their business. </sentence><sentence id="127">And they refused to go into bankruptcy. </sentence><sentence id="128">And so we had to give up our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and we moved into one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">My sister, myself, my mother and father, and occasionally my mother's sister. </sentence><sentence id="130">And on the Sabbath, in this one <span class="interior space">room</span>, when during the day we would not light -- there was no light, the most beautiful time was when later in the afternoon -- we went to <span class="building">synagogue</span> in the morning, but later in the afternoon we would crawl in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> with Mother and Father, and my father would tell these stories about he served four years in the war -- in -- on the side of <span class="country">Germany</span>, incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="131">But my mother would sing the most beautiful Jewish songs, and most of them are very sad, but they were beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="132">And we -- my -- we used to si -- we were lying in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> crying, not because we were unhappy, because we were happy. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I've learned a lot from that. </sentence><sentence id="134">I -- I've learned to become This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="135">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="136"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection really sentimental about my -- my Yiddish [indecipherable] and to appreciate li -- really life, because the songs deal with life. </sentence><sentence id="137">So I would say i-if you say what gave it to me, and what -- what my life was like, this I think determined the way I am. </sentence><sentence id="138">Those times. </sentence><sentence id="139">I remember at the end of the day on the Sabbath, they turned the lights on, and they would sit down at a <span class="spatial object">table</span> and they would divide the money they had earned -- they went to work for other people, and they divided the money that they had to pay the creditors. </sentence><sentence id="140">And when things got better, my mother and father were able to get back into business. </sentence><sentence id="141">My father was very proud of the name, he wouldn't think of bankruptcy. </sentence><sentence id="142">And again, that I think taught me a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="143">So these were -- these were happy times, although they were tough times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Tell me about the Jewish life in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> in general. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, Jewish people were about 10 percent of the population. </sentence><sentence id="169">And it was a very rich life. </sentence><sentence id="170">The Jews were involved in -- in the music, they were involved in -- in politics, they were involved certainly in the arts and sciences, and in teaching. </sentence><sentence id="171">And Jews, generally speaking, I would say, were quite influential. </sentence><sentence id="172">They were also -- not all of them were successful, but they were mostly successful people, and -- and very law abiding. </sentence><sentence id="173">We didn't -- we had nobody to be ashamed of. </sentence><sentence id="174">So Jewish life was a rich life, I would say, although I must tell you, sa -- when -- I go back now to -- to this sa -- during the day on Saturday, the thing that really touched me is my mother would tell us stories about her life as a teenager in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">She grew up in a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Lubachow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">Her parents, I would say, were poor people. </sentence><sentence id="177">Very, very observant. </sentence><sentence id="178">I still remember my grandfather, very much so because he was a very imposing man with a white beard, and -- but he always would tell me these stories, and my mother would tell us what happened to her as a child. </sentence><sentence id="179">She was sent away from <span class="building">home</span> when she was not even 10 years old because the fear that they had of pogroms, when soldiers would come and rape girls. </sentence><sentence id="180">They -- she and her sisters would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="182"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection hide under the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">And so one day they were sent to -- to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> to a -- to a member of the family, and my mother, at age 10 or so, had to work for that family, although she lived with them. </sentence><sentence id="184">She was like a -- she took care of the baby, she helped clean the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">So when you hear from your own mother what -- what she went through -- but my mother was never bitter. </sentence><sentence id="186">The -- the thing that my mother always said, but look, here we are. </sentence><sentence id="187">And thank God we are alive. </sentence><sentence id="188">I -- I survived that. </sentence><sentence id="189">So these are -- these are all part of my -- my make-up, and it was very meaningful to me to hear what my parents went through. </sentence><sentence id="190">My father went -- was in the service for four years as I told you, he was wounded in the war. </sentence><sentence id="191">And yet, when Hitler came, it made absolutely no -- no difference. </sentence><sentence id="192">Neither my mother nor my father went to <span class="building">public school</span> because the <span class="building">public school</span> would not have them. </sentence><sentence id="193">And both my parents were self educated, and went in business self educated. </sentence><sentence id="194">So as a result of that, education was the most important thing in our family. </sentence><sentence id="195">So it -- it all comes back. </sentence><sentence id="196">You know, people say, well, the Jewish people are so intent on education. </sentence><sentence id="197">This is a good reason. </sentence><sentence id="198">That's why. </sentence><sentence id="199">And my mother would even write in her -- she -- she sometimes would keep a <span class="spatial object">journal</span>, which we found only recently, and it was very touching what she said. </sentence><sentence id="200">She says, one day I had -- I prayed that my children would have a good education. </sentence><sentence id="201">It's the most important thing in the world. </sentence><sentence id="202">So -- so perhaps this gives you a -- a picture of what -- what it was like, life for me in our <span class="building">house</span>, and generally life in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">But we had good times in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, too, we used to -- we used to go to <span class="spatial object">balls</span>, and -- during Mardi Gras season. </sentence><sentence id="204">In fact, every summer we would have a <span class="building">house</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>, and that's where I met my -- my wife, when I was -- I was 17 and she was 14. </sentence><sentence id="205">And the day I met her I told her I was going to marry her, and her father overheard it, and I was not his favorite person after that. </sentence><sentence id="206">She was -- she was the only child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: You spoke of education. </sentence><sentence id="249">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and whether you went to <span class="building">integrated schools</span> -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="252"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: -- or whether you went only to <span class="building">Jewish institutions</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="260">No, I went -- when my -- my <span class="building">grammar school</span> was boys only, and that's not unusual, it was a <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">I went to <span class="building">grammar school</span> for four years, it was totally integrated. </sentence><sentence id="262">We had -- in fact I had many non-Jewish friends when I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">And then after -- at age 10 is when I finished <span class="building">grammar school</span>, and stood an exam to enter into a <span class="building">private high school</span> called <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">And that too was integrated. </sentence><sentence id="265">We had religion -- we took religion in <span class="building">school</span> in contrast to <span class="country">America</span>, and this is -- that's one reason why I feel so strong about not mixing religion with the state, because we -- when we went to <span class="building">school</span>, we had religion, but we had to leave our <span class="interior space">room</span>, and we went to <span class="building">Jewish class</span>, so to speak, when others went to the <span class="building">Christian class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">That was not very good, but -- but the <span class="building">school</span> was integrated. </sentence><sentence id="267">I experienced anti-Semitism then, where you know, you'd find scribbled notes, you Jew, or Jew go back to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="268">Some of the professors we had, I felt were anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="269">Maybe it's because I didn't study that much, but some of them, on the other hand, I felt were very sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="270">So my schooling -- I finished <span class="building">school</span> not because I was genius, but the system was that you can finish <span class="building">high school</span> after four years, and I went to work as an apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I made the equivalent of maybe 20 dollars a month. </sentence><sentence id="272">And while I, however, while I was working I went to a <span class="building">business school</span> for three years. </sentence><sentence id="273">And while I was not a very good student in the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, <span class="building">business school</span> was really what I wanted, and I -- I -- I did quite well. </sentence><sentence id="274">So I worked and went to <span class="building">school</span> at the same time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: And what was the work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: I -- the sc -- the <span class="building">business</span> that I worked for, they had five and 10 cent <span class="building">stores</span> which they started, and in fact they were among the first. </sentence><sentence id="294">And they also would sell merchandise on This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="295">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="296"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection consignment and put people in business. </sentence><sentence id="297">And my work when I first started was sweeping <span class="interior space">floors</span> and cleaning <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span> and that sort of thing, but within -- when I was 17, I was in charge of a <span class="building">department</span> and I had learned about import/export, because a lot of the merchandise which we sold was imported. </sentence><sentence id="298">And I had taken all kinds of courses which enabled me to become a buyer for -- for that <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">And a good many of the people that worked -- the <span class="building">company</span> was owned by a Jewish man, and the people that worked there were both Jews and non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="300">And I must tell you this, we haven't come to Hitler yet, but Hitler came in on a -- on a Friday, on, I believe it was March the 11". </sentence><sentence id="301">On Monday I went to work, we didn't know what to do, so you go, like you always go, I went to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">And the same people that I had worked with for several years already -- this was 1937 -- is when -- deg38, excuse me, when Hitler came. </sentence><sentence id="303">The same people that I had worked with for several years suddenly appeared in Nazi uniforms with the swastika band. </sentence><sentence id="304">The same people that I had lunch with every day, that I -- that I went out with, the very same people. </sentence><sentence id="305">And that was a shock. </sentence><sentence id="306">And this -- this just tells you really, what went on, and how -- how life was. </sentence><sentence id="307">In a way we kidded ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="308">We -- we kidded. </sentence><sentence id="309">Although we had all of these fights and troubles, but never thought that it would get to a point as it did. </sentence><sentence id="310">What also happened is a man who worked for the owner of our <span class="building">company</span>, that our owner had put in <span class="building">business</span>, came in one day and took over the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">Came in with a group of Nazis in black and brown uniforms and just took the business. </sentence><sentence id="312">And ironically made out a receipt, and fired everybody, except three of us. </sentence><sentence id="313">And we were put into one <span class="building">office</span>, in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, and we -- and the reason they didn't fire us is the people they put in charge had to learn something. </sentence><sentence id="314">So I'm -- I'm trying to really give you a picture of -- it's -- it's -- it's -- when I think about it, "m really amazed myself of how we were so foolish prior to Hitler not to recognize, or not to sense that there was more to this than just having a fight in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="316">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="317"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Let's just backtrack, cause of course I -- I want you to tell me much more about when Hitler came in. </sentence><sentence id="346">You mentioned that there were fights in the s -- in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, or scribbled notes. </sentence><sentence id="347">Can you talk a little bit more about other hints, or -- or outright incidents of anti-Semitism prior to Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: Well, of course the Nazi party had started many, many years ago. </sentence><sentence id="352">And in fact, they killed a chancellor, his name was Dollfuss, several years before Hitler came into <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">But it was after 1933, where Hitler came into <span class="country">Germany</span>, where he took over the German government. </sentence><sentence id="354">And those people, his followers, killed Dollfuss, and they were put in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">So there was always that unrest, and there was always -- <span class="country">Austria</span> had maybe 10 - 15 political parties, and there were marches in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">It's -- it's quite different than it is here. </sentence><sentence id="357">And it always resulted in -- in fights and even killings. </sentence><sentence id="358">There was -- the anti-Semitism that you could feel in <span class="country">Austria</span> was that sometimes you could not live where you wanted to live. </sentence><sentence id="359">You were rejected on a job because you were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="360">So it -- it wa -- it wa -- those kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="361">But we lived with it, and this was -- you almost get used to a way of life, that's just the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="362">And so you -- you live with it. </sentence><sentence id="363">When people came -- we had somebody in the place where I worked who had come from <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span> and he told us stories about that <span class="building">Jewish businesses</span> were taken over, and Jews were beaten and all that. </sentence><sentence id="364">I must tell you the truth, we didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="365">We thought oh, there must be something wrong with that man. </sentence><sentence id="366">Why would they do anything like that? </sentence><sentence id="367">So there was a difference between political national socialism and the anti-Semitic part of anti -- o-of that fascism. </sentence><sentence id="368">It was either political, but it was also anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="369">So it was in that atmosphere that we grew up. </sentence><sentence id="370">Maybe I felt it more than others because I was in a <span class="building">Jewish club</span>, and maybe because of the <span class="region">section</span> where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="371">Maybe I was more aware of it because of the education that I had. </sentence><sentence id="372">And my mother, the stories that she would tell me, I -- I was sort of on the -- I -- I had like an <span class="spatial object">antenna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="373">You -- you get sensitive where you -- where you feel these things. </sentence><sentence id="374">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="375">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="376"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: Were you beaten up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1793">A: In November of 1938, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1794">So the whole family, we were all working at the <span class="building">shirt factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And -- and I had made progress there, I -- I was there -- after six years, seven years, I became a -- a vice president of the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1796">He was very good to me, he -- he said, "I'll let you buy one percent of the <span class="building">business</span>, and the way you pay for it is from the profit." </sentence><sentence id="1797">And so I owned one percent of the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Ultimately I did go in business for myself in 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1799">I went in <span class="building">business</span>, I left him. </sentence><sentence id="1800">He was, I would say rightfully so, he was upset, because he had been wonderful to me. </sentence><sentence id="1801">But I always wanted to be in business for myself, and we had saved up about 10,000 dollars, because every time I was promoted, I would get a very nice increase, and my wife worked, and I worked, and we -- we were careful. </sentence><sentence id="1802">W-We never had a credit -- a charge card until we had enough money to know that we can pay. </sentence><sentence id="1803">So anyhow, I went in business with a partner in 1946, and went into the shirt business in a different <span class="populated place">city</span> because I didn't want to be competitive. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And after two years we split. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And he remained with the <span class="building">business</span>, and I had more money than I thought ever existed, because we had done well in those two years. </sentence><sentence id="1806">But as partners we did not get along, and we had a buy or sell agreement. </sentence><sentence id="1807">So after I sold my share of the business, a few days later I went in business for myself, and my only partner was my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1808">I started a company called <span class="building">Maxon shirt company</span>, and that was in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And the company did well, and we, in the meantime we had three children, three wonderful children, two daughters and a son. </sentence><sentence id="1810">We had bought our own <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1811">It was modest, and -- but we paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="1812">And so I went into business, as I said myself, and that was in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1813">14 years later I sold that <span

who had very bad business problems. </sentence><sentence id="1819">And he -- I noticed that he was really beside himself, and I -- I said this -- this -- I just won't let this happen. </sentence><sentence id="1820">And so I said, I don't want to be the richest man in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And we had a chance to either go public, or sell the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1822">And I told Trude, I said Trude, "I -- I want to sell. </sentence><sentence id="1823">How do you feel about it?" </sentence><sentence id="1824">And she says, "If that's what you want. </sentence><sentence id="1825">What are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1826">I said, "Don't worry." </sentence><sentence id="1827">So in 1962, after in business 14 years, I sold the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And I stayed with the <span class="building">business</span> for five years, I had a contract. </sentence><sentence id="1829">I was active in the <span class="populated place">community</span> as soon as I could. </sentence><sentence id="1830">My first experience in community work was with a group of Christian women who were interested to do something about first and youthful offenders. </sentence><sentence id="1831">It was my first involvement, and I became deeply interested in that when we were able to get laws changed where youthful offenders were separated from hardened criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And I continued to be quite active in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, including, of course, the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, president of the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and every Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="1833">And then one day I received a call saying there's a rumor that you are interested to run for mayor. </sentence><sentence id="1834">I thought -- that had never, never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="1835">But I had been involved do something about <span class="building">housing</span> for the poor. </sentence><sentence id="1836">I became very interested in that, and I started a <span class="building">housing foundation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And wherever I turned, I found that the government is involved. </sentence><sentence id="1838">And I said no, I -- I'm not going to run for mayor, but maybe I'll run for <span class="building">city council</span>, and I did. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And so I was elected for -- on a two year term. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And then after two years the -- the term of the mayor was up. </sentence><sentence id="1841">And I -- I ran for mayor and I was elected, about 70 percent of the vote. </sentence><sentence id="1842">Interestingly enough, I ran as a democrat, I had no opposition from the republicans,

</sentence><sentence id="1843">This is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1844">And I says, "Well God never said anything to me about you." </sentence><sentence id="1845">Well, make a long story
