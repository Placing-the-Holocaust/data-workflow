<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1215">Q: Can you recall the reaction of some of the Americans around you to some of these events like the Nuremberg trials and [indecipherable] and then even the nur -- the Eichmann trial [indecipherable] in American media. </sentence><sentence id="1216">If you -- if you could kind of tell me how it was presented and how it was received by the American public? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: Well, the people that I knew felt that these trials were justified because they had also heard about the horrors that had gone on so that they felt that these trials were necessary, that the state <span class="country">Israel</span> was necessary and they even felt that if it hadn't been for the Holocaust there might not have been a state of <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1220">But people were feeling so guilty about what had happened that it was time that the Jews were able to develop a homeland of their own so that if God forbid this ever happened again, perhaps then people would go to <span class="country">Israel</span> to be somewhat safe. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And the people that I knew felt that the Germans needed to be executed themselves as a result of what they had done during the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
