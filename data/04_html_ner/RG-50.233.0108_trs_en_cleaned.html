<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992. </sentence><sentence id="24">We're speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her parents. </sentence><sentence id="25">What can you tell us, let's start with your mother, is that all right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know about her childhood, anything at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="34">My mother's name was Klara Gottfried Reif. </sentence><sentence id="35">G-o-t-t-f-r-i-e-d,. </sentence><sentence id="36">She was born in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, not far from <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> which is now called <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady. </sentence><sentence id="38">She often said that she -- I guess she didn't get along with her father as well as with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">She liked to run around and travel and do a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="40">She spoke several languages because when she was a child, the <span class="dlf">borders</span> kept changing and so at one point, where she was born, was part o <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">I think both she and my father were actually Austrian citizens because when they were born, <span class="country">Poland</span> was a part of <span class="country">Austria</span>, then the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="42">She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think she spoke some <span class="country">Czechoslovakian</span> and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages. </sentence><sentence id="43">She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I never remember whether it's five or seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Do you know what they spoke at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I think at <span class="building">home</span>, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="58">Yeah, I think that was correct. </sentence><sentence id="59">My mother did a lot of traveling around. </sentence><sentence id="60">She used to go to <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> to have clothes made and so on. </sentence><sentence id="61">I think she went off to <span class="building">school</span> at some point also. </sentence><sentence id="62">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="63">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="64"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you know what kind of <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="74">Was it a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> or a <span class="building">private school</span> or a <span class="building">technical school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="78">No, it was definitely not a <span class="building">technical school</span> and I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="79">Ihave a feeling it might have been more like a <span class="building">finishing school</span> or just some kind of <span class="building">general school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">She definitely finished <span class="building">gymnasium</span> but did not go to <span class="building">college</span> but she was pretty clever. </sentence><sentence id="81">She was very, very good with numbers and she did a lot of reading. </sentence><sentence id="82">Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was young in fashion and that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="83">At some point she went off to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> either for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="84">Somehow and I don't know how, but she met my father. </sentence><sentence id="85">Ultimately they got engaged and then they got married, I think in 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: They got married in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: They got married in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, well, I'm not sure about that. </sentence><sentence id="98">I'm not sure about that, they might have gone back to <span class="country">Poland</span> to get married. </sentence><sentence id="99">But anyway, they lived in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> after they got married. </sentence><sentence id="100">Then in 1927, my brother was born. </sentence><sentence id="101">Now my mother tells me about her life in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">She said in the beginning it was kind of hard. </sentence><sentence id="103">My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and retrained as a dentist and he opened his <span class="building">practice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">Now one of the things my mother always told me is that we lived in <span class="populated place">Este</span> , that's the first <span class="region">district</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">Excuse me, the <span class="dlf">Este</span> is where she would have liked to live  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the servants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well. </sentence><sentence id="107">I think she went and I think they did a fair amount of socializing. </sentence><sentence id="108">I think they went to the <span class="building">opera</span> and they would go dancing and go to the <span class="building">theater</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">I know they went -- apparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually -- the daughter lives in <span class="populated place">New York</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="110">They must have done a lot of things like that. </sentence><sentence id="111">I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a more -- I don't know, a more frivolous person. </sentence><sentence id="112">Actually my brother apparently didn't do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he really liked my father. </sentence><sentence id="113">But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he was very little. </sentence><sentence id="114">Then --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Can we back up just a little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="136"> A Yeah go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Do you know about her life in <span class="country">Poland</span> before she moved to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>? </sentence><sentence id="139">Do you know about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life? </sentence><sentence id="140">Were they religious, were they orthodox? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: I think her parents were orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="145">I don't know that my mother really -- I mean my mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I'm not sure she really believed in any of that. </sentence><sentence id="146">I don't know, she certainly had some sorts of superstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she probably went along with the things. </sentence><sentence id="147">I don't think she and my father had -- we didn't have a <span class="building">kosher house</span> and we --. </sentence><sentence id="148">I think they did go to services on the high holidays and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="149">I'd be curious to know whether we -- I'm sure we ate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread? </sentence><sentence id="150">I don't know what the answer is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Was it ham on matzo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="161">Well, I'm sure we ate ham. </sentence><sentence id="162">I'm absolutely sure we ate ham. </sentence><sentence id="163">We probably didn't eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don't think it was terribly compulsive. </sentence><sentence id="164">I think it was fairly casual. </sentence><sentence id="165">I have a feeling that her father was probably not very casual and I don't know about her mother. </sentence><sentence id="166">I have a feeling that the mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort of retiring religious kind of person. </sentence><sentence id="167">I think that my mother always felt that she was considered the black sheep. </sentence><sentence id="168">Not by her mother, but by her father, that her father didn't like her as well as he liked the other two kids. </sentence><sentence id="169">I think she thought that was because she was sort of rebellious and didn't do the things that the other kids did. </sentence><sentence id="170">Definitely, my mother's brother and sister sound like more traditional kids. </sentence><sentence id="171">They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same <span class="populated place">town</span>, or nearby. </sentence><sentence id="172">Here was this young chick going off to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and marrying strange people. </sentence><sentence id="173">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="175"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="195">There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her relatives. </sentence><sentence id="196">I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went to live in <span class="country">Israel</span> and whose son is in <span class="country">Israel</span> and is a physician, I think. </sentence><sentence id="197">Of course, I lost contact after my mother died. </sentence><sentence id="198">I think the letter was from this guy Moshe Weinhaub. </sentence><sentence id="199">It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives. </sentence><sentence id="200">Well, they all perished in one form or another. </sentence><sentence id="201">Now my mother's sister, that was the most dramatic thing. </sentence><sentence id="202">Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her kids into an <span class="spatial object">oven</span> and then they shot her. </sentence><sentence id="203">That was really a horror story. </sentence><sentence id="204">I think my mother's brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a lot of people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> had typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="205">They purposely tried to contract typhoid and they did so they died of the typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="206">They purposely did that because they didn't want to die in what they knew was awaiting them. </sentence><sentence id="207">There were just descriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about. </sentence><sentence id="208">I don't know whatever happened to that letter. </sentence><sentence id="209">As a matter of fact, it's really weird. </sentence><sentence id="210">This is my mother's -- those two pieces of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> are my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="211">Since my mother died. </sentence><sentence id="212">I have not been able to find the key to this. </sentence><sentence id="213">Every once in a while, I try to get it open because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in there. </sentence><sentence id="214">I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="215">Part of me wants to know what's behind those little <span class="dlf">doors</span> and part of me probably doesn't. </sentence><sentence id="216">But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a very, very different person after the war from what she was before. </sentence><sentence id="217">Although I can't really judge that, that's kind of a guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: I made you jump. </sentence><sentence id="243">Now why don't we come back to the time that she had given birth to your brother, I guess? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927. </sentence><sentence id="247">My brother was apparently a very serious little boy even at age two. </sentence><sentence id="248">My mother always told stories about how when she would go for a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want to have her read the <span class="dlf">street</span> signs. </sentence><sentence id="249">What does that say, how do you spell that, what are the letters? </sentence><sentence id="250">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="251">That's her perception. </sentence><sentence id="252">My brother -- I have a picture of my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox with his rear end up -- sort of off the <span class="env feature">sand</span> so he wouldn't get himself dirty. </sentence><sentence id="253">My brother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn't allowed to be a little boy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn't get dirty. </sentence><sentence id="254">I think there were a lot of interesting dynamics there. </sentence><sentence id="255">Then at age three, they started him on violin lessons. </sentence><sentence id="256">Somehow it didn't work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="257">Then he started again at the age five. </sentence><sentence id="258">Then it really took hold very well and he really did play the violin. </sentence><sentence id="259">If you ask him, he'll say, well you know, I'm not -- I can't really play very well. </sentence><sentence id="260">But he really plays. </sentence><sentence id="261">I mean for an amateur, he plays extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="262">Then when my father died -- well first my father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking very bad in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">I really should back up. </sentence><sentence id="264">Starting in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="265">I think things This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="266">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="267"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection started being politically very hairy. </sentence><sentence id="268">People had just come out of a Depression. </sentence><sentence id="269">As an aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an accident because I'm seven and a half years younger than my brother. </sentence><sentence id="270">Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody which in retrospect seems silly. </sentence><sentence id="271">But actually I was over forty once when I asked my brother, was I an accident? </sentence><sentence id="272">My brother said, no, absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="273">Why did they wait so long? </sentence><sentence id="274">Because of the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="275">I was born in 1934, in November and so things were --. </sentence><sentence id="276">Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a kid because things were not looking good. </sentence><sentence id="277">Did I send you the article I wrote for <span class="building">Boston Magazine</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: You sent me one about your cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: I didn't send you one from <span class="building">Boston Magazine</span>? </sentence><sentence id="315">I should give that to you because that's sort of about this subject. </sentence><sentence id="316">Anyway, so then I was born, and then things started getting bad. </sentence><sentence id="317">They got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="318">My father and mother started talking about the possibility of going to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">Apparently my father just felt - - in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right? </sentence><sentence id="320">So his feeling was, how can I go to <span class="country">America</span>? </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't know the language; I would have to retrain. </sentence><sentence id="322">We would get there and we would have nothing so it just didn't seem like a reasonable thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="323">But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like everybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more. </sentence><sentence id="324">My father got really, really, very, very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="325">My brother, I think my brother really still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my mother not handling that right. </sentence><sentence id="326">I've asked him about that and he says well, she used to say well you know you got to come out of this. </sentence><sentence id="327">You can't walk around like this. </sentence><sentence id="328">She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done. </sentence><sentence id="329">I said to my brother, well what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="330">He said, well I remember standing in a dark <span class="interior space">room</span> holding his hand, just quietly. </sentence><sentence id="331">Now that I'm at my present age and our kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="332">How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really don't know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it's kind of a survival thing. </sentence><sentence id="333">That you've got to just keep doing what are your daily things because otherwise you're going to go insane also. </sentence><sentence id="334">I don't know what was going on there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were happening to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="335">I'm sure that my father must have been extremely frightened. </sentence><sentence id="336">There's a woman who actually went to medical and then <span class="building">dental school</span> with my father. </sentence><sentence id="337">We were always friendly with that family. </sentence><sentence id="338">For example, that woman was forced to go out and scrub the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="339">All sorts of demeaning things happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time psychologically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="368"> A Yes, I think he did work regularly. </sentence><sentence id="369">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="370">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="371"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever? </sentence><sentence id="377">He didn't --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: No, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="381">I think he got very depressed after he had to close his practice. </sentence><sentence id="382">Now I don't know that for sure, I just know that from things that I've gathered. </sentence><sentence id="383">Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business. </sentence><sentence id="384">Somewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="385">So they went and applied for visas and passports and so on. </sentence><sentence id="386">On the morning of September 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the <span class="building">house</span> together to go pick up those passports. </sentence><sentence id="387">They picked up the passports and at about noontime, they parted to do separate chores. </sentence><sentence id="388">They were supposed to meet, I think, at the <span class="building">home</span> of this cousin where they used to play cards. </sentence><sentence id="389">Apparently my father never got there. </sentence><sentence id="390">I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody telling me, there was a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="391">My father had been found at the bottom of a <span class="dlf">staircase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="392">I'm not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on the way to the <span class="building">hospital</span> or right after he got to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">But the death certificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of fractured ribs. </sentence><sentence id="394">All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the <span class="interior space">top floor</span>, the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> of this -- down the <span class="interior space">stairwell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">There was a lot of trauma around that. </sentence><sentence id="396">My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="397">My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="398">You know, it's funny, children don't ask the right questions all the time. </sentence><sentence id="399">I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently about that. </sentence><sentence id="400">I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to. </sentence><sentence id="401">When I was discussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I've never kept this a secret. </sentence><sentence id="402">Then a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking, well, now how do we know he committed suicide? </sentence><sentence id="403">People say you're just trying to protect yourself from this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="404">First of all, I don't have anything against this, I just don't. </sentence><sentence id="405">It wouldn't -- in general it wouldn't bother me now. </sentence><sentence id="406">I keep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="407">I suppose in one way it doesn't bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a shirking of your responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="408">You know you had two kids and this was not the appropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids. </sentence><sentence id="409">My brother's idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the reasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people were committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a woman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there was no husband around. </sentence><sentence id="410">At that time, mostly it was the men who were being really harassed, initially. </sentence><sentence id="411">I don't know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I think, well there was nobody there to see this. </sentence><sentence id="412">All sorts of horrible things were happening to Jews, how do we know what really happened? </sentence><sentence id="413">Could he have been pushed? </sentence><sentence id="414">I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="415">The other thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession who has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself off a <span class="interior space">stairwell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">That's another reason why I think that maybe he didn't do it himself. </sentence><sentence id="417">On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they're not necessarily being totally rational. </sentence><sentence id="418">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="419">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="420"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Right, the way some people plan it out. </sentence><sentence id="463">This sounds like it perhaps hadn't been contemplated f or long, this specific act if it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="466">A: I don't know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was also a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide apparently also jumped off something or other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: Yes, he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: But anyway, the answer is I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="471">When this happened, my mother was just totally devastated, just --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: Before we -- I hate to break your train of thought? </sentence></p></dialogue>
