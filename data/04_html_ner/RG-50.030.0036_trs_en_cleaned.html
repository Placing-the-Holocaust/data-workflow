<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Tell me your full name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Shony Alex Braun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span>--at the time was governed by <span class="country">Romania</span> and later [1940] switched to <span class="country">Hungary</span>--in 1930, July 14th. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Shony, tell me a little bit about family and your childhood, will you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born into an orthodox family. </sentence><sentence id="14">And we were very family- minded, and, of course, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="15">My parents, and... uh ...he was a jeweler, actually. </sentence><sentence id="16">And...uh...we...we were a very close knit family. </sentence><sentence id="17">And a very interesting thing happened with me, if I may share with you. </sentence><sentence id="18">At age four, I got lost in a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">The governess took me out; and she said she sat down and fell asleep, and I walked away. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I was found by the Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="21">There were some Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="22">They were roaming the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">And maybe they have come from...God knows which part of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">However, they found me and they kept me for about three days. </sentence><sentence id="25">And this is where I first time heard the violin. </sentence><sentence id="26">And seems like that was a destiny, because would it not be for the violin--as you will hear later of our conversation--I would not be able to speak to you today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Will you...(cough)... Tell me about your...your family. </sentence><sentence id="42">Um, did you have brothers and sisters? </sentence><sentence id="43">What did you do during the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="48">I was the fourth of six children. </sentence><sentence id="49">And because of the fact that the <span class="spatial object">violin</span>, I was exposed that early... Of course, these Gypsies returned me to my family after they found out whom I belonged to. </sentence><sentence id="50">And...uh...we were...I was actually three. </sentence><sentence id="51">It's very strange--probably unbelievable--but in three...at three years old I was when I started to learn the Hebrew alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="52">When I was five, I could read it very well. </sentence><sentence id="53">And the everyday's life was actually studying and...uh...lot of...lot of praying at the time, as usual. </sentence><sentence id="54">And, of course, one other thing. </sentence><sentence id="55">Uh...The <span class="region">area</span> where we lived in <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span>, the <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">I.G. Duca--L.G. Duca</span>, that was given after a assassinated Romanian president. ! </sentence><sentence id="56">And...uh...they were not very friendly to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="57">And at the time it was not that severe as it came later on. </sentence><sentence id="58">So, we were restricted. </sentence><sentence id="59">However, we went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">And ...uh...every one of my brothers and sisters--we were two sisters and four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="61">And...uh...we were allowed to...to go to <span class="building">school</span> and learn like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="62">However, we would be hearing here and there that we are a Jew, or occasionally that we were "Christ-killers." </sentence><sentence id="63">And that restricted us. </sentence><sentence id="64">Of course, certain places " The original name of the <span class="populated place">town</span> was <span class="populated place">Szekely-Keresztur</span> (Hung), or <span class="populated place">Criturul-Secuiesc</span> (Rom). </sentence><sentence id="65">The name was changed sometime in the 1930s, in honor of the slain Romanian leader Ion G. Duca. ( </sentence><sentence id="66">Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991). </sentence><sentence id="67"> we could not join. </sentence><sentence id="68">Like we children would have loved to be a part of this <span class="building">club</span> or that <span class="building">club</span> where other children were, but we were not allowed to. </sentence><sentence id="69">And this... this is how our everyday lifes went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: When did you start to learn the violin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Uh, about a year later. </sentence><sentence id="97">As...as I mentioned, I was four when I got exposed by the Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="98">And these were very nice people, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="99">Uh, a year later, my parents found a small violin. </sentence><sentence id="100">Due to the fact that there wasn't a day going by that I would not be begging my parents, "I want this! </sentence><sentence id="101">I want this!" </sentence><sentence id="102">I couldn't even say "hegedii"--that's Hungarian name for the violin. </sentence><sentence id="103">So finally, they gave in. </sentence><sentence id="104">And exactly that, to be exact July 14, which was my birthday, they...uh, at age five, they finally presented me with a violin. </sentence><sentence id="105">And I was not allowed to hold, actually, to...uh play with that; only and strictly with a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="106">Because my father, I'm sure that he knew, and so did my mother, that if I had just gotten on and I would have played and maybe got frustrated trying alone to get a tune here and there what I heard from the Gypsies, from bird imitations and God knows what else. </sentence><sentence id="107">So I would have been just dropping it. </sentence><sentence id="108">But no, it was with a teacher from the beginning on. </sentence><sentence id="109">And would you believe that not once I had to be told to practice. </sentence><sentence id="110">In fact, just the opposite happened. </sentence><sentence id="111">My mother, for instance, would tell my father, "Just tell him to go out and play outside, and go on the <span class="env feature">sun</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">Look how pale he is! </sentence><sentence id="113">He's...he's practicing too much. </sentence><sentence id="114">And he's not going with some of the other children out." </sentence><sentence id="115">You know. </sentence><sentence id="116">And so this is really strange, because most children has to be told...have to be told, "Practice!" </sentence><sentence id="117">But not me. </sentence><sentence id="118">I loved it from the start. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Tell us where that took you, as...as a young child. </sentence><sentence id="143">What did you end up doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: When...uh... I really honestly have to tell you this. </sentence><sentence id="147">This is only to share with you. </sentence><sentence id="148">I'm not trying to impress anyone. </sentence><sentence id="149">But...uh...I progressed rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="150">Was due to the fact probably that I loved it so much; and also, of course, that I was born with a good musical ear. </sentence><sentence id="151">And...uh...by the time I was 11, I enrolled to a nearby <span class="interior space">conservatory</span>, nearby our <span class="populated place">city</span>, maybe...uh ...60 kilometers--which was probably less than 30 miles away." </sentence><sentence id="152">And I was one of the very few student that was admitted. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now at that time really to be admitted in that <span class="building">school</span> and to that specific teacher, you really had to be...uh...very tops. </sentence><sentence id="154">Because Jews were only admitted a certain percentage; and then you had to be playing or knowing or...or being twice or three times as good as your other friends who were not Jewish, you know? </sentence><sentence id="155">And...uh...it happened that I got a scholarship with this man. </sentence><sentence id="156">And with age...up to age 13, where I graduated the <span class="interior space">conservatory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">And then I got another scholarship at that point... If | may mention--at that point, we were already instead of being <span class="country">Romania</span>... Of course, in 1940 when I was 10 years old, just to back up a little, then a...a major change occurred when unfortunately Hitler invaded or came into <span class="country">Hungary</span> and...uh...actually came to <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span>, and then forced the Romanian to give a part of <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span> back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">The Hungarians claimed they &gt; This was in <span class="populated place">Tirgu-MureO</span> (also: <span class="populated place">Targu-MureO</span>). </sentence><sentence id="159">The same <span class="populated place">city</span> is also known by the Hungarian name of <span class="populated place">Maros-Vasarhely</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="160">Information from telephone conversation with Shony Alex Braun, 25 Jul 1991). </sentence><sentence id="161"> were always theirs; and the Romanian, of course, argued that it was not so. </sentence><sentence id="162">And so now we, instead of being Romanian, we became Hungarian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="163">But then the problem was more more severe for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="164">Slowly, we were thrown out of <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">I was an exceptional...uh...person as far as the Hungarians concerned, with...with their law; because while I was in that--it was not a <span class="populated place">city</span>, a small <span class="populated place">town</span>--I would be playing for the...uh... police, giving a concert as a youngster. </sentence><sentence id="166">Or for the <span class="spatial object">fireman's ball</span>; they would feature me before anything, with a solo or so. </sentence><sentence id="167">So because I did so many charitable things in that <span class="populated place">city</span>... Like the poor people--at Christmas time, they would be asking an Orthodox Jew... But still, it was no difference, you know, as far as... When you can do something good, then you do it. </sentence><sentence id="168">And, uh...so we...I was actually allowed because of that, it really came...uh, to my...to my rescue as far as not being thrown out of the <span class="building">school</span> immediately. </sentence><sentence id="169">So there were very few percentage of the Jews...uh, Jewish children that they were allowed to...be made exception. </sentence><sentence id="170">And I was one of them they made an exception to the rule. </sentence><sentence id="171">So I was allowed to continue, up "til one dreadful morning in May 1944. </sentence><sentence id="172">That's where the Hungarian gendarme--small <span class="populated place">town</span> police-- was banging on the <span class="dlf">door</span> in our <span class="building">home</span>...at our <span class="building">home</span>, and said, "We give you one hour to gather some belongings. </sentence><sentence id="173">For instance, pots and pans and the clothes on your back and some blankets. </sentence><sentence id="174">One hour." </sentence><sentence id="175">And they herded us into an <span class="building">apartment complex</span> in the <span class="dlf">back yard</span> of. </sentence><sentence id="176">And they was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="177">You...you wondering what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="178">And for us children, we couldn't...we couldn't comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="179">Why...why they doing that? </sentence><sentence id="180">In fact, before this came to pass, uh...I like to mention that laws came. </sentence><sentence id="181">For instance, Jews were not allowed to go out without yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="182">And that brought even more antisemitism by the...some adults and the mostly, of course, younger children or teenagers. </sentence><sentence id="183">They would be spitting at us. </sentence><sentence id="184">They would be throwing stones at us. </sentence><sentence id="185">Sometimes I would be comered by going from one place to the other in...or I would be on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="186">And sometimes...uh, they would be torn ...uh, the...the... What do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="187">The coat off my back; and just left there, you know, practically almost with nothing on me. </sentence><sentence id="188">To which...to shame me, because I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="189">And we would be called "Christ-killers." </sentence><sentence id="190">It was...it was impossible to comprehend that the same person who "yesterday" was playing with me--gentiles--today he would be beating me up and calling me "Christ-killer." </sentence><sentence id="191">So that day... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: What... Tell me a little more about those years. </sentence><sentence id="241">You were very young. </sentence><sentence id="242">Uh, what...what...what else was your family doing during these years of occupation? </sentence><sentence id="243">What was life like in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: We...we actually...uh...started, as I have mentioned, in 1940 until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="249">Uh, periodically, it was very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="250">For instance, my father--who was an Orthodox Jew--naturally wouldn't ever be open, or the <span class="building">store</span>, on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="251">They forced us to open. </sentence><sentence id="252">That was only to...uh...to make you do something which is against your conviction, against your religious beliefs. </sentence><sentence id="253">And they were--the gendarme, the so-called police who I mentioned--would be there, make sure that he opened every Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="254">So that...and he would be sitting there in the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">And we...we would be...uh...restricted from many things. </sentence><sentence id="256">Jews were not allowed, of course, later on, to be on the <span class="dlf">street</span> from a certain time on. </sentence><sentence id="257">If you caught on the <span class="dlf">street</span> from...let's say from 6:00 on, you would be imprison and beaten up by the police. </sentence><sentence id="258">Not only...of course, it was very dangerous to...to walk on the...on the <span class="dlf">street</span> at that hour; because not only that the  police would be getting at you, but the people that they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="259">I must tell you honestly, not every one of them were anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="260">For instance, there was a...must, for the sake of truth, must mention it. </sentence><sentence id="261">Was very strange though. </sentence><sentence id="262">Was...uh, a friend of my father, a German who was bank director. </sentence><sentence id="263">And he would be giving my father helpful hints. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh, for instance, like he foresee what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="265">He foresee it. </sentence><sentence id="266">Because he had informations, because he was a German. </sentence><sentence id="267">But instead of keeping quiet, he would come to my father and would say, for instance, "Listen, you having minor children. </sentence><sentence id="268">Why don't you falsify their birth certificate?Make them older. </sentence><sentence id="269">Just in case if something happens, then...uh...they are old enough to work. </sentence><sentence id="270">Rather than something will happen to them." </sentence><sentence id="271">And my father knew quite a bit in advance, but he would never tell us or not even to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="272">So we would not make them...not scare them, you know, or us. </sentence><sentence id="273">My parents were fantastic, I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="274">My father was just a genius in many, many different... Even in medicine, which is actually what he studied to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="275">But then war, speaking of the other war, came; and he had to do something different. </sentence><sentence id="276">So he became a <span class="building">jeweler</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">It's a wonderful thing to be. </sentence><sentence id="278">So this was...uh, actually the life during the occupation, as far as the Hungarians came. </sentence><sentence id="279">Now from...at that time, if I may continue, from that time on, when we were herded into that <span class="building">apartment complex</span> and were about 200 or more Jews gathered from all kind of a directions--not only from thats...uh, <span class="populated place">town</span>, but from neighboring <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">We were there. </sentence><sentence id="281">We were outside. </sentence><sentence id="282">We had our absolutely no...nothing to lay on. </sentence><sentence id="283">For instance, we...we were in the <span class="dlf">back yard</span> and on the <span class="env feature">grass</span>, and it was still wet. </sentence><sentence id="284">And sometimes it complicated things when...when was raining. </sentence><sentence id="285">We were absolutely out in the open. </sentence><sentence id="286">Kept there, and soaking wet, with very little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="287">What we brought, gathered in that one hour which I mentioned when the police banged on our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">Everything we were stripped of. </sentence><sentence id="289">The only thing, as I mentioned, we were allowed to be taken the clothes which we had on, a blanket and some pots and pans. </sentence><sentence id="290">Now from that place about three or four days later, when enough Jews were gathered, we were put on <span class="spatial object">horse-drawn carts</span> and we were taken into a <span class="building">brick factory</span> nearby. </sentence><sentence id="291">And they were thousands of Jews gathered, their families; and the...the condition was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="292">For instance, now they...they had...the first time in my life I have seen SS guards and officers in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">In fact, the sad thing about it is that's was the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I went and studied in <span class="interior space">conservatory</span>, when it was so wonderful that I would be allowed to be one of those Jews and having a scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="294">Now the very same <span class="populated place">town</span>, I am imprisoned and encaptured--captured, I mean--in that <span class="building">brick factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">This also when it rained there was nothing, absolutely nothing, to cover us. </sentence><sentence id="296">Not...not very long after--we were there about a week, I would say maybe roughly speaking--and some other terrible thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="297">My two older brothers were drafted by the Hungarian Army as what they called "forced laborer." </sentence><sentence id="298">And it came the news that they were sent in the front. </sentence><sentence id="299">You know, this is what they did. </sentence><sentence id="300">The...the SS did the same thing, as well as the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="301">They sent the Jewish forced laborer... they, they wore armband and the star, but they went ahead of the...of the soldiers, of the Hungarian or German soldiers, and so that if they were mined ahead of them. </sentence><sentence id="302">So wherever the <span class="region">territory</span> was mined, they would be stepping on it, would be blown up-- (cough) excuse me--and not the...not the Army. </sentence><sentence id="303">And word came. </sentence><sentence id="304">And you imagine now this. </sentence><sentence id="305">I was a 13 year old, not quite 14, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="306">And somehow I intercepted that letter which came to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that my two brothers--the older brothers, Adolph and Emil--were both perished. </sentence><sentence id="307">They were both blown to pieces by one of these <span class="dlf">mines</span>...one of these <span class="dlf">mines</span>, that were under...you know, undermined. </sentence><sentence id="308">And I kept that terrible secret "til liberation because I  would never tell my father nor my mother. </sentence><sentence id="309">Nor would I tell my sister, was still there. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh, my older sister was...uh...with us at the time. </sentence><sentence id="311">Was only the two...when the family was taken from <span class="building">home</span>, my old...two older brothers were already forced laborer...taken as forced laborer. </sentence><sentence id="312">And that terrible knowledge that I couldn't share with anyone. </sentence><sentence id="313">And I begged the person who brought the letter, actually, the notification, not to say a word to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="314">And I don't know how did he...he got...uh...uh, that knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="315">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="316">It came...uh...through the <span class="spatial object">mail</span>, it came from the <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, or whatever it was the case. </sentence><sentence id="317">Because somebody else from his family was blown up; and so were the Braun brothers, my two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="318">And I would not tell. </sentence><sentence id="319">But to keep that awful things within me, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="320">So being in that...in that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we had very little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="321">Very, very little. </sentence><sentence id="322">And something happened. </sentence><sentence id="323">The SS would be <span class="building">building</span> outside in the open, within that the frame of the <span class="building">brick factory</span>, <span class="building">latrinas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">And would...I as, well...you know, when..when you privacy when you...when you have to...uh, when...when <span class="env feature">nature</span> calls you. </sentence><sentence id="325">And...uh, I would have never ever even dreamed to do anything in presence of...of somebody who's not only is a stranger, not even friends. </sentence><sentence id="326">In fact, even our parents, let's say, we would be not exposing ourselves openly. </sentence><sentence id="327">That's somehow strange, but that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="328">It...it took 5, 10...maybe 5 to 10 days being in that. </sentence><sentence id="329">It's very, very unbelievable; but it's true. </sentence><sentence id="330">I couldn't possibly ...uh, do what...what nature calls. </sentence><sentence id="331">And that...that caused a terrible problem, because we were in the open. </sentence><sentence id="332">And I noticed when women and men, they...right in the open. </sentence><sentence id="333">And then the SS would come and take pictures of us; and they would be laughing and...and enjoying that terrible shame that we had, to do our duties in the open and during the day. </sentence><sentence id="334">At least, if it was nights or darkness...you know? </sentence><sentence id="335">But it...it just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="336">Now, one day they gathered us again and took us out to the <span class="building">train station</span>, and they said we have to go. </sentence><sentence id="337">I noticed the <span class="spatial object">train</span> with <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="338">Now, there were also no facilities where one can go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, if that's the way you want to call it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="339">And what...strange thing happened that we...some of us, refused to board the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">And the SS said, "We're going to kill you if you're not going to board the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="341">So some people threw themselves down to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">And the SS went and at random took some children and some women, some older people; and they lined up and just shot them at random. </sentence><sentence id="343">Just shot them dead. </sentence><sentence id="344">That, of course, scared the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="345">So what we did, in order... For them, life was absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="346">Like you stepping on an <span class="spatial object">ant</span>, even less. </sentence><sentence id="347">But--(coughing) excuse me--they want to...want to show to the rest of us terror. </sentence><sentence id="348">Always that SS terror, you know; with that fear and terror that we would be mindlessly following what they ordered us to do. </sentence><sentence id="349">And we...we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I can tell you, the worst thing yet to come, in that specific <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> was no sanitation facilities. </sentence><sentence id="351">Was no <span class="env feature">air</span>, no <span class="env feature">water</span>; and a very, very rare occasion the <span class="spatial object">train</span> would be stopping and then they would allow some people to get off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">Some. </sentence><sentence id="353">And mostly... uh, older people, maybe sometimes they allowed them. </sentence><sentence id="354">What happened, if they didn't come back soon enough, they would just shoot them like dogs. </sentence><sentence id="355">And now, at the next stop when it was, then people were afraid to get off. </sentence><sentence id="356">They would say, "Whoever wants to get out, you can get off." </sentence><sentence id="357">Yah, but when you get off, you knew that you gonna be shot if you're not gonna be back.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="577">A: When uh Mengele motioned to me to the right, of course, I went immediately into the group where my father and my older brother were. </sentence><sentence id="578">Because then they would be separating men and women. </sentence><sentence id="579">And we were taken to a <span class="building">building</span> where we were stripped from everything now, even what we had on our back. </sentence><sentence id="580">Every... everything we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="581">And we were shaven, and everywhere where you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="582">And then later on, we were issued these prisoners"...uh...uniform, and assigned to a <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">A few days later, while we were...

One of the...one of the lucky thing, in a way, for me...the terrible thing was they would be dead. </sentence><sentence id="673">Of course, they would be stark naked. </sentence><sentence id="674">They would be sending us to go and pick up the dead bodies who they Just gassed, and...and cart them up to the <span class="building">crematoria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">My...as I said, lucky for me, was that I was not the one at the time who belonged to the <span class="building">Sonderkommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">Because, I assure you, I would have killed myself right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="677">I could not see my mother being...and my sister being in that condition and...and killed, and then I would go on living. </sentence><sentence id="678">I couldn't survive it. </sentence><sentence id="679">Now, back when the <span class="building">Sonderkommando</span>--other words, they were reunited. </sentence><sentence id="680">And my father and my brother, as I mentioned it, and I, were reunited. </sentence><sentence id="681">We were reunited and off to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">While we were going, one of the prisoner...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1836">A: So as I mentioned, that these...they were afraid and they're going to be a riot, and they're going to shoot each other. </sentence><sentence id="1837">Because they were arguing, these SS, who should do the shooting when I be put against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1838">I was...my turn was to...
