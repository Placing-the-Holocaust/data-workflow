<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Let's hear a little about that. </sentence><sentence id="458">Just prior to the war, your mother made efforts to obtain visas for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="491">Q: Just after the deportation, as you were describing it before, where were you and what happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: The Germans made the <span class="interior space">Jewish quarters</span> smaller. </sentence><sentence id="494">They tightened the <span class="region">area</span> for the Jews, made it smaller. </sentence><sentence id="495">The part where we lived on the little <span class="building">farm house</span> was out of the <span class="region">Jewish area</span>, so we had to move in into a smaller... , well, this was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> without <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">And at that time we had to, my father and I had to go back to the <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span> to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="497">My mother went with my sister to the Farber's to live, to her uncle, and a short time later they found <span class="interior space">room</span> for my father and myself also and we slept ten people in one <span class="interior space">room</span> because the Farbers had their son and their relatives come from other <span class="populated place">cities</span> to live with them. </sentence><sentence id="498">At that time they thought that <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> is, will be safer and they wanted to stay with the family. </sentence><sentence id="499">So there were ten people in one <span class="interior space">room</span> sleeping on the 01:44: <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">And it didn't take long till the second deportation started. </sentence><sentence id="501">And we heard about the date because the Germans said the Jews should be ready for a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> on this and this date, and Uncle Farber in his <span class="interior space">lumber yard</span> dug two <span class="dlf">ditches</span> underneath the floorboards of the <span class="building">lumber yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="502">One for his family and one for his immediate relatives. </sentence><sentence id="503">I thought that we are included so my father said as soon as he heard about the deportation, he says let's go. </sentence><sentence id="504">This was the day before the actual date, and went to hiding in the <span class="interior space">lumber yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="505">When the action began it was too late already for the Farber family to get there because the Germans were rounding up the Jews already and they couldn't go through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, so you know Uncle Farber and his two  daughters climbed up on the <span class="interior space">roof</span> of the <span class="building">building</span> and there was a big <span class="dlf">chimney</span> like the <span class="building">European buildings</span> have, those wide <span class="dlf">chimneys</span>, hid behind the <span class="dlf">chimney</span> and it didn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="506">The Germans were rounding up the Jews in this <span class="building">building</span> and one of the neighbors, downstairs neighbors, pointed out to the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> to the Germans Uncle Farber with his two daughters, and that's how he was killed and my family hid under the <span class="interior space">floorboards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="507">And we heard shooting for about four days because this <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span> was situated also on the <span class="building">market place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="508"><span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> had about four <span class="building">market places</span> and this was a gathering place for farmers and you know, when they came to, before the war, to the to the <span class="building">market place</span> to sell their goods. </sentence><sentence id="509">We were flat, prostrate on our backs under the <span class="dlf">floorboards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="511">We didn't know when is day, when was night, and all we heard was yelling and screaming and the German shepherd dogs barking outside. </sentence><sentence id="512">This was another thing, a miracle that the German shepherds didn't sniff us out. </sentence><sentence id="513">During the the massacre, during the action, there were Polish young people who helped the Germans kill Jews. </sentence><sentence id="514">There was the Legion, the <span class="building">Polish Legion</span> they called themselves. </sentence><sentence id="515">And two of them came into the <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span> and they were standing right above us urinating and one said to the other, oh, if I catch a Jew, I won't give him over to the to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="516">I will cut off his head with my axe. </sentence><sentence id="517">And this was the attitude of the anti- Semites in in <span class="country">Poland</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="518">They were even helping the Germans kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="519">And when it was over we came out smelling like roses. </sentence><sentence id="520">We were covered with feces and dirt. </sentence><sentence id="521">We looked at each other and started laughing. </sentence><sentence id="522">But during the deportations my mother was so scared underneath the <span class="dlf">floorboards</span> that she was hallucinating and we had to slap her face. </sentence><sentence id="523">She saw a Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="524">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="525">It was pitch dark. </sentence><sentence id="526">She was hallucinating. </sentence><sentence id="527">She saw a Gestapo man with that with a <span class="spatial

heart this was the end of the person. </sentence><sentence id="531">Could never live through if someone was weak. </sentence><sentence id="532">You had to be a really super strong to - all the people that survived the war were people that were strong, strong people. </sentence><sentence id="533">Otherwise you couldn't survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Germans allowed the people from the <span class="building">barrack</span>, they should volunteer to go into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> - it was a <span class="env

the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And while the bombings were going on, the wave after wave of <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, we went underneath
