<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: No he lived in the same <span class="building">house</span>, the same place. </sentence><sentence id="26">Because they had two <span class="building">houses</span> which belonged to this <span class="building">flourmill</span> and the <span class="dlf">lumber yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">So they lived there and they were not thrown out yet in this time. </sentence><sentence id="28">And this <span class="building">house</span> she lived with them and then when I came back I started to see her quite often, practically every day. </sentence><sentence id="29">And if she needed something I took care of it. </sentence><sentence id="30">And she lived there with the family "till June 1941, was established a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, so she was taken with the family to that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">They got two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in a <span class="building">house</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and she lived with the two uncles, the aunts with their children in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: You were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: I was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> too, so when in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there was a different system. </sentence><sentence id="42">The Germans didn't go out and grab people, Jews from the <span class="building">houses</span> in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> to go to work, it was already organized. </sentence><sentence id="43">There was a Judenrat and the Judenrat had a list of all able-bodied Jews and they divided and they sent out cards what day each Jew had to work. </sentence><sentence id="44">This way not the same Jews should be called every day. </sentence><sentence id="45">So when it came to <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>'s time so she was notified and she went to work like other Jews went to work, cleaning <span class="building">houses</span> by Germans, cleaning the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, throwing away snow in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="46">She did all kinds of work the same way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: O,K. Then we lived like this in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and then later I was taken away from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">This was in January "42 which was already bad because every time the situation got worse so I had a mastoid, a middle ear infection, and they had to smuggle me out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so she had to go with me with my younger sister to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">But the day we had to go by <span class="spatial object">sled</span> in the very deep winter high snow, so she had trouble with her tonsils, she had high temperature, so she didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="58">But when I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and I was operated, about two weeks later she came to this <span class="populated place">town</span> to the big <span class="populated place">town</span>, somehow she got a pass because you couldn't travel by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, you couldn't go out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">We were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">So she got a pass and she came to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="61">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="62"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection me to the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and I think this was the most happiest day in this time that she arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: You got sick with an ear infection and you were sent to <span class="populated place">Tarnov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">I wasn't sent. </sentence><sentence id="74">I was with an ear infection over four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="75">Instead to take care, we didn't have nobody to take care and it got worse and worse until the whole pus went already to the brain and then we saw that there is no way. </sentence><sentence id="76">I was practically dead. </sentence><sentence id="77">So with a <span class="spatial object">sled</span> they took me out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to ,toa bigger <span class="populated place">town</span> and we came to and we came to , to a doctor, there was a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection already so far, the <span class="dlf">gates</span> were closed and April 28, the Gestapo came in, they shot my father, they shot this time 22 Jews, and they had a list of 22 Jews and my father was between them and then later everything went down, every day was worse, there were killings and killings and killings. </sentence><sentence id="78">Until June the 20" we were chased out from our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, from <span class="populated place">Kollupzowa</span>, to a larger <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to and in <span class="dlf">vee</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="86"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection saw we had nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="87">After a few months, and the end of November, we escaped into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and this is how I survived. </sentence><sentence id="88">Otherwise we would be taken to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span> the same thing as all the people, because they accumulated in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> about hundred thousand Jews from all <span class="populated place">towns</span> who surround <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">Because what they want to do is they want to have the Jews in one place where there is a <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Now they told the Jews that they can take along with them anything they want. </sentence><sentence id="91">So this is what they wanted, the Jews should bring over everything and later when they took them away to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span> all their stuff was left in the <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the Germans had it in one place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: In <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: In <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and they later took it to their <span class="building">warehouses</span> and the things that they needed they took away and the rest they gave to Poles. </sentence><sentence id="101">The other thing I wanted to mention about <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>, when we Saw it starting to be bad, this was before I went to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">You see I had a younger sister, my younger sister, and she was very pretty, she was very intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="103">She spoke a few languages. </sentence><sentence id="104">She spoke English, she spoke German, she spoke Hebrew, Polish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: Was this Rachel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Rachel. </sentence><sentence id="113">And Rachel was only three years older than I was so we tried to arrange, Rachel should escape because there was a man, a Polish family who were thrown out from their <span class="building">houses</span>, from their <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="populated place">Pozna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114"><span class="populated place">Pozna</span> was a <span class="populated place">town</span> that it was next to the <span class="region">German Reich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">This was from <span class="dlf">western border</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> and they came to our <span class="populated place">town</span> and they opened a little <span class="building">store</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span> in the beginning of the war, and became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="116">And they had a son a little older than I was, about five years older, and we became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="117">So he begged my mother and Rachel, they would move away from our <span class="populated place">town</span> to a different <span class="populated place">town</span> and they would make believe that her son is a husband of Rachel, that Rachel is a daughter-in-law, in this way she would be able to survive with them. </sentence><sentence id="118">When they told us this, we thought it's a very good idea and then I came to <span class="populated place">Rozia</span> and she looked Jewish whatsoever, she looked so typical Aryan. </sentence><sentence id="119">She had blue-greenish eyes and she had gold hair and she didn't look at all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="120">So I told her, let's make arrangements because Rachel is going to run away with this family and you will go with them and we will make up somehow papers that you are a sister. </sentence><sentence id="121">We'll make false papers, it means that she's married to this Pole and you will go away with them. </sentence><sentence id="122">We talked and talked and she somehow was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="123">She said, I cannot take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="124">I am afraid. </sentence><sentence id="125">I do not have guts to do it. </sentence><sentence id="126">She said, my sister Rachel could do it because you are so capable, she admired Rachel, and you can do it. </sentence><sentence id="127">So Rachel didn't want to go because she didn't want to leave the family. </sentence><sentence id="128">And <span class="populated place">Rozia</span> was afraid, she was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="129">Maybe if she wouldn't be afraid maybe Rachel would somehow leave the family and go. </sentence><sentence id="130">Well, once we told them this, my sister Rachel had another chance to be saved. </sentence><sentence id="131">When the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was established, they brought into our <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="building">Arbeits Amt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">Arbeits Amt means a <span class="building">German labor office</span> to register all the working people and the head of it was a German, and they needed somebody to be his secretary who spoke fluently German and could write German. </sentence><sentence id="133">My sister spoke beautiful German. </sentence><sentence id="134">So the Judenrat assigned my sister to be his secretary, and she worked with him. </sentence><sentence id="135">They became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="136">He liked her very much. </sentence><sentence id="137">She was a very nice person, and when the Jews were chased out of our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, naturally this Arbeits Ant didn't exist any more. </sentence><sentence id="138">So in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, somehow on the <span class="dlf">street</span> he met my sister, he was very happy, he said, you know what I am transferred from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and I am now the head of the <span class="building">Arbeits Amt</span> in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and I need a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="139">Why don't you become again my secretary and I will give you a permit to stay here and you will not be taken away. </sentence><sentence id="140">So she said she would remain if he will give a pass to my other sisters and to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="141">My This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="142">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="143"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection father was already shot. </sentence><sentence id="144">He said well I can only save you not the other ones. </sentence><sentence id="145">So she didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="146">So sometimes the closeness of the family, the attachment to the family sometimes it was a curse for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="147">Because a lot f Jews could be saved, they could save themselves to run away, or do something, but they wouldn't do it because they didn't want to leave their families, their fathers, their mothers, their sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="148">So this time she didn't want to go away if he wouldn't give the permit to them to be left. </sentence><sentence id="149">So we're talking about, we went away a little from <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>, but this is how she perished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: How did you find out about Rozia's family in <span class="country">Russia</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Well when I went to <span class="country">Russia</span>, when I escaped to <span class="country">Russia</span>, I knew that they are there. </sentence><sentence id="193">So we went to <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>, <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">In <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> everybody from each <span class="populated place">town</span> knew about somebody else who was there. </sentence><sentence id="195">So we got acquainted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: And later, after the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: After the war they were in <span class="region">Siberia</span> and during the war before <span class="country">Germany</span> attacked <span class="country">Russia</span> they used to send cards to <span class="populated place">Rozia</span> from <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">So we answered them a letters. </sentence><sentence id="204">Then after the liberation they were liberated, somehow they sent a card to <span class="populated place">Rozia</span> to <span class="populated place">Kollupzowa</span> and they wanted to find out what happened to them, if they are in this time in because they were released from the . </sentence><sentence id="205">And they wrote a letter, so I got the address. </sentence><sentence id="206">I wasn't in <span class="populated place">Kollupzowa</span>,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection closer to <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">Also he used to tell stories. </sentence><sentence id="208">He was a philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="209">So sometimes he caught me with my friends, he used to tell is stories about philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="210">Nobody wanted to listen. </sentence><sentence id="211">I always was standing there listening to him because again the same stories. </sentence><sentence id="212">But special about <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>, yes, also this may be interesting. </sentence><sentence id="213">After when I came back and I was not anymore Hassidic and I started to see <span class="populated place">Rozia</span>, we joined the <span class="building">Hanoar Hotzioni</span>, this is a youth, Israeli Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I was very happy that we joined, because she joined at this time together and then later my sister Rachel, was the head of this group in our <span class="populated place">town</span> and then later when I wasn't anymore Hassidic, I took over and I became the head of this organization. </sentence><sentence id="215">And we got together and we sang songs, we started Hebrew and we went out on outings and then already this was one of my happiest days because in this group, Rozia also belonged to the same organization until the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="216">So that's all that I can tell you about is the times that we belonged to the organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: How long did she belong to the <span class="building">youth movement</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: To the youth movement she belonged from, I would say, about two years, a year and a half, two years. </sentence><sentence id="236">I would say deg38 and half "39. </sentence><sentence id="237">And then the war started. </sentence><sentence id="238">Then in 1939 I wanted to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, but I couldn't so I made contact to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> illegal. </sentence><sentence id="239">You paid in 500 zlotys and they took you to <span class="country">Romania</span> and from <span class="country">Romania</span>, illegal on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">So I remember with a friend of mine I paid in the 500 zlotys to go, he didn't have the money so I remember his mother sold two candlesticks and some pearls for him to have the money. </sentence><sentence id="241">We sent in the money and we waited any day to go. </sentence><sentence id="242">We got letters and then we didn't go because the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="243">And during all this time we made arrangements that if I would go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> the first thing I would see to make arrangements for <span class="populated place">Rozia</span> to come over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: She wanted to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: She wanted to go, yes. </sentence><sentence id="256">Well this was everything quietly. </sentence><sentence id="257">I didn't tell it to my family, she didn't tell it to her family. </sentence><sentence id="258">But between us we made plans to go and to settle in <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">Also, in the beginning of the war there was a German company had the ad in the paper that if somebody wants to go to <span class="country">America</span> and if they have family, we can register and we would be able to go to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">And this was during the war. </sentence><sentence id="261">You had to send in so much money to be registered but you had to have blood relations. </sentence><sentence id="262">Yes, I had a brother, so I remember my sister Rachel, registered and I registered with <span class="building">Rozia</span> and I registered that we were married, because we said in case this will come and it will be actual ready, so we would be married and we will go. </sentence><sentence id="263">So we sent in some money and later we didn't hear anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="264">So my sister, Rachel, had a <span class="spatial object">Chusen</span> (?), </sentence><sentence id="265">so he came to <span class="country">America</span> a week before the war broke out and he came and she didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="266">She could come before but she waited for him. </sentence><sentence id="267">Listen, you only need half a page, but I don't know what you would pick out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Now, I just want to ask one or two more things. </sentence><sentence id="298">Maybe you can describe to me where Rozia lived, maybe the <span class="building">house</span> she lived in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: O.K. They lived, mostly Jews lived in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">Mostly Jews lived around the <span class="building">market place</span> and the <span class="building">market place</span> all <span class="building">houses</span> were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="303">Only four <span class="building">houses</span> in the <span class="building">market place</span>, which was very big, were no Jewish and all the Jews had the businesses and the rest of the Jews were not rich, were very poor lived around the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">They were small crooked <span class="building">houses</span>, old <span class="building">houses</span> falling down. </sentence><sentence id="305">Rozia lived I would say about half a mile or maybe a kilometer, no about a mile out of <span class="populated place">town</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">And they lived there and they had two <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">Three families had two <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">There was a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="309">Her parents. </sentence><sentence id="310">Her mother had a sister and a brother and they were all in the business. </sentence><sentence id="311">In the business before the war and they lived in those <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">They were nice <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">It's not comparison like we have in <span class="country">America</span> because there was no running water and there was no indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="314">But the <span class="building">houses</span> were nice with beautiful <span class="dlf">gardens</span> with flowers. </sentence><sentence id="315">Now one of the sisters of her mother, her name was Mrs. Smith, she was very particular in her <span class="interior space">garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="316">She always worked, with beautiful flowers and every time there was a <span class="interior space">concourse</span>, it was how you say, to judge which flowers, a contest, her flowers were the nicest. </sentence><sentence id="317">She didn't have children so she had the flowers. </sentence><sentence id="318">So they lived there, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="319">The only thing they had more than we in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, we didn't have electricity, they had electricity. </sentence><sentence id="320">The reason why is because they had electricity from the <span class="building">mills</span> because they had there the <span class="spatial object">generators</span>, so they had electricity for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="321">So for us it was something important because when we come we saw electricity. </sentence><sentence id="322">They had very beautiful <span class="building">homes</span>, very nicely furnished. </sentence><sentence id="323">But for our <span class="populated place">town</span> it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="324">But it was lacking water and indoor plumbing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Was the <span class="building">mill</span> fairly successful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
