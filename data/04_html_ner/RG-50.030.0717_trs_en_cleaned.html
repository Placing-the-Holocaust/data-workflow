<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: It was as close as you could come when the winner tries the loser. </sentence><sentence id="709">And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, "Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?" </sentence><sentence id="710">And he went into great detail and says, you know, "We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that. </sentence><sentence id="711">We paid the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="712">We gave them a place to work and fitted it out for them. </sentence><sentence id="713">We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them." </sentence><sentence id="714">You know, they did whatever they possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="715">And, also, the the judge Judge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained. </sentence><sentence id="716">So | think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice. </sentence><sentence id="717">And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="718"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="719">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="720"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="721"> what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences. </sentence><sentence id="722">You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="723">Q: And some were acquitted, too? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: You know, he had very little power, practically no power, as far as running the <span class="country">country</span> is concerned, but but I think I think it was great symbolism to to include him, because he was so, you know you know, back during that period there was hardly a week or two or three weeks that you didn't read about Streicher in the American press as to remarks that he had made or things that he had done, antiSemitic stuff, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: Tell us about that interview. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: Well, Jackson at the beginning made a statement that he didn't want to make a circus out of this, and that he didn't want any second guessing on each day's testimony, so he, in effect, you know, admonished his own staff, and he said he would give no interviews until the trial was over. </sentence><sentence id="796">I knew his press secretary or got to know him, Gordon Dean, and I said you know, I tried to get through that, and he said, "No, the boss doesn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="797">He is afraid if he does something with you, that will break the <span class="dlf">line</span>." </sentence><sentence id="798">And one night I got the idea that the approach should be that he owes it to the soldiers who are still there to tell them what he is trying to do, and I told called my went up to see my friend and told him, and and he went and told Jackson what my argument was, and he says, you know, they are talking about people who fought this war who some of them, many of them injured, all of them lost friends, and then Jackson agreed, but he wanted the questions submitted in advance. </sentence><sentence id="799">And he did not change and he didn't change the questions either. </sentence><sentence id="800">He </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: Do you recall the most do you recall any of the most interesting comments he made that stuck with you? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="802"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="803">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="804"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="805">A: Well, I guess the most quotable thing was that, "These people are being tried not because they lost the war, but because they started the war." </sentence><sentence id="806">And it was the interview was more scholarly than sensational. </sentence></p></dialogue>
