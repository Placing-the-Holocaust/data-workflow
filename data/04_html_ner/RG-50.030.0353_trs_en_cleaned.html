<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: It was. </sentence><sentence id="284">But I wouldn't venture out of the <span class="building">office</span>, because most of the wounded were both <span class="country">Romania</span> soldiers and some German. </sentence><sentence id="285">As I mentioned at this point, Jewish kids were kicked out of <span class="building">school</span> and the <span class="populated place">community</span> had organized it's own <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286"><span class="building">High school</span> was down the <span class="dlf">street</span> from us and looking back, I could just . . . </sentence><sentence id="287">the incongruity of it that under such circumstances, every Jewish child studied music. </sentence><sentence id="288">Kept, every day you could see them walk  down to <span class="building">school</span> with their <span class="spatial object">instruments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">I studied the violin and it kept us <span class="interior space">indoors</span> and we had no radio or television or any other entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="290">This was something other than book... .books. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Again, they conducted all the, most of the business, most of the commerce in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">Again, the peasants that used to bring their produce to <span class="populated place">Bivolari</span> would now come to <span class="populated place">Iasi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">In fact, the peasantry multiplied because the <span class="dlf">border</span> now was opened to <span class="populated place">Bessarabia</span>, part of <span class="country">Russia</span>, and they too would bring their goods and their .. .. And many of them became merchants themselves, so they would come to us buy wholesale and take it back to the old <span class="building">Bivolari</span>, that was now occupied, all the <span class="building">houses</span>, by some of the peasantry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
