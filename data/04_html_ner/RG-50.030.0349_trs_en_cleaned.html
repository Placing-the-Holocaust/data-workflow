<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: What's the name of the <span class="populated place">city</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: . </sentence><sentence id="321">And in the distance we could see -- on the <span class="dlf">road</span> in the distance -- moving side <span class="spatial object">cars</span> -- <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">We could see that in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="323">And we had seen

id="325">Were just a few stragglers who were trying to go wherever they could. </sentence><sentence id="326">And so we saw -- late at night -- it was almost dusk -- and the color of their uniform was strange. </sentence><sentence id="327">It was very strange. </sentence><sentence id="328">So at first we thought they were British soldiers who were trying to -- to go back to <span class="populated

class="dlf">collection road</span> -- they were looking absolutely -- they were awful. </sentence><sentence id="336">They were raw, military power. </sentence><sentence id="337">And of course, I understood that years later, when I was myself in the Army, the people who are sent like that are the best. </sentence><sentence id="338">They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="339">So they passed by us, and I remember we were walking by the <span class="building">barracks</span> of the French Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a <span class="interior space">balcony</span> at the <span class="building">barracks</span> there with the sign and the flag. </sentence><sentence id="340">And the wife of one of the

id="354">And they were telling us, Well, a week we'll be in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">And after that they left. </sentence><sentence id="356">I don't know where they went. </sentence><sentence id="357">And they were replaced by the regular German Army. </sentence><sentence id="358">That place was like an <span class="populated place">administrative city</span>, so they established a commandanture there. </sentence><sentence id="359">But that was essentially for them -- you know, they -- they ordered a curfew for the population and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="360">But at the same time they were trying to show to the French people that, Well, we are not that bad. </sentence><sentence id="361">And I remember, we stayed there one month before we were able to go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">And one of the son of that <span class="populated place">city</span> was a Navy officer who died at <span class="populated place">Dunkirk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">And his body was recovered and was sent to that place to be buried in the <span class="interior space">family vault</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">And the whole <span class="populated place">city</span> came to the funeral in the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">And the Germans sent an honor guard there. </sentence><sentence id="366">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="367">And they allowed his <span class="spatial object">coffin</span> to be draped in the French flag. </sentence><sentence id="368">So -- and when -- when -- so they had a Mass inside the <span class="building">church</span> and when they came out, you know, people were carrying the <span class="spatial object">coffin</span> on their shoulders, and the Germans had the salute with their rifles. </sentence><sentence id="369">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
