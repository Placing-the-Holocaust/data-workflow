<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Not very much, really. </sentence><sentence id="68">We knew that the Jews were being mistreated and there were massacres. </sentence><sentence id="69">That information reached us through the mass media. </sentence><sentence id="70">And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive. </sentence><sentence id="71">And it had this Jewish component, which I felt very strongly about. </sentence><sentence id="72">And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> who approached me and said, you know, <span class="building">UNRRA</span> is looking for people to work in their program. </sentence><sentence id="73"><span class="building">UNRRA</span> had two This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="74">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="75"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection programs after the war. </sentence><sentence id="76">They had a program for refugees, and they had a program for <span class="country">countries</span> which had suffered at the hands of the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="77"> There the country programs were designed to ship goods, needed goods, to strengthen -- to begin the pouring of life blood into the economy. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was a big program in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">Some in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">None in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and, of course, the very big one in the <span class="region">Far East</span>, <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">Which really attracted me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="82">I wanted to go someplace, and I asked for <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">And then, one day, I was at the <span class="building">University of Maryland</span> after I had been accepted -- and it was sort of touch and go, because of my health problems with the military, but I made it. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I was now at the <span class="building">University of Maryland</span> getting briefed, educated on the whole program. </sentence><sentence id="85">And somebody from <span class="building">UNRRA headquarters</span> came over to speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="86">And he said to me, "Why are you going to <span class="country">China</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="87">I really didn't have a good reason, you know, except I wanted to see that <span class="region">part of the world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And he said, "You come from <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">Do you speak Yiddish?" </sentence><sentence id="90">and I said, "Yes, I do speak Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="91">And he said, "You must go -- our people -- he was Jewish, too -- are in desperate trouble over there." </sentence><sentence id="92">And they were, you know, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we need Yiddish speaking staff. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I want you to go." </sentence><sentence id="95">And I went. </sentence><sentence id="96">And I was trained for just about a month. </sentence><sentence id="97">We had seminars and all the rest, and I took off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What was the preparation like? </sentence><sentence id="132">What was the training like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Well, first of all, they told us structurally what the program was about, who supplied what, and what was the chain of responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="136">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, the principal responsibility for refugee programs lay with the military. </sentence><sentence id="137">And they were very unwilling participants in the program. </sentence><sentence id="138">They didn't want -- "We're not welfare workers. </sentence><sentence id="139">And we're not --" You know, some of the things which were being said. </sentence><sentence id="140">They had no taste for it. </sentence><sentence id="141">Refugees are a terrible pain in the behind in getting in the way of the movement of troops and <span class="spatial object">materiel</span>, and they just distract the military from its principal mission. </sentence><sentence id="142">And so now <span class="building">UNRRA</span> was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="country">Italy</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, running these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">Staffed <span class="building">UNRRA</span> by international personnel, people -- <span class="building">United Nations agency</span>, therefore, the people were drawn from Western powers, you know, <span class="country">France</span>, the <span class="region">Benelux countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">We had a Swiss on my team, and Americans. </sentence><sentence id="145">And so we learned about that chain of command and some of the problems. </sentence><sentence id="146">By the way, they really didn't know too much about the problems. </sentence><sentence id="147">There was a great dissociation between what was happening in the <span class="dlf">field</span> and what these people knew in the <span class="building">national headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">And that's a constant difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="149"> And then we took off. </sentence><sentence id="150">And we -- I remember I went on the <span class="populated place">Gripsholm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">I was put aboard with a group of UNRRA people. </sentence><sentence id="152"><span class="populated place">Gripsholm</span>, which had been during the war, an <span class="spatial object">exchange ship</span> for diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="153">It is not the present-day This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="154">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="155"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="populated place">Gripsholm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">There are new <span class="populated place">Gripsholms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">And this <span class="populated place">Gripsholm</span> was a real <span class="spatial object">rat trap</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">During the war, it had exchanged diplomatic people, Japanese from the <span class="country">United States</span> to <span class="country">Japan</span>, etc., </sentence><sentence id="159">and reverse. </sentence><sentence id="160">And I spent ten seasick days on the <span class="populated place">Gripsholm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I think we came into <span class="populated place">Cherbourg</span>, and from <span class="populated place">Cherbourg</span> by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">And there we stayed in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> for two or three weeks getting more briefings. </sentence><sentence id="163">And then came the day they say, "You are off." </sentence><sentence id="164">And I was sent by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> on the <span class="spatial object">Orient-Express</span>, but it was not that fabulous <span class="spatial object">Orient-Express</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">And in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, I was immediately whisked as the supply officer for UNRRA team, I think it was 560 if I am not mistaken, outside of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">Shall I go on? </sentence><sentence id="167">There was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> there which had just been established, I think in December of "45. </sentence><sentence id="168">I arrived about February, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="169">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="170">In the early part of the year. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was the winter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: 1946? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: "46. </sentence><sentence id="214">And a <span class="populated place">camp</span> had been established by General McNarmey, who was Eisenhower's successor as the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allies Expeditionary Force) commander or something. </sentence><sentence id="215"> And they had evacuated a whole <span class="dlf">zedlum</span> (ph) <span class="populated place">silek</span>? </sentence><sentence id="216">of <span class="populated place">settlements</span> of small <span class="building">bungalows</span>, I think about 250 such <span class="building">houses</span>, which had been sold by the Nazis, built by the Nazis, for German workers, defense industry workers and their families. </sentence><sentence id="217">Two or three, <span class="spatial object">bed</span> -- two <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span> apiece, and downstairs was a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">It was in the 1930s style. </sentence><sentence id="219">There was no gas in these <span class="spatial object">stoves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">For example, the <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> were fed with, and the heat was created by, use of firewood. </sentence><sentence id="221">But it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="222">I mean, until we began to stuff the people who were coming in, into these places. </sentence><sentence id="223">More than -- you would say in each <span class="building">house</span>, if you had 250 <span class="building">houses</span>, you had four or five people. </sentence><sentence id="224">That would have been maybe 1200 people, but we had as much as 3,000 at one time. </sentence><sentence id="225"> And it was beyond its capacity. </sentence><sentence id="226">When I arrived, and the Jews who came into that <span class="populated place">camp</span> were infiltrees (infiltrators?). </sentence><sentence id="227">They were not, by and large, survivors of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">It is estimated, I have read estimates, figures -- accurate figures are very, very difficult to come by. </sentence><sentence id="229">There was so much disorganization. -- </sentence><sentence id="230">that there were no more than 35,000 <span class="populated place">Jewish concentration camp</span> survivors in <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">And this <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> was very close to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">And most, many of the survivors that we got were <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> survivors. </sentence><sentence id="233">The Germans had tried to destroy -- there was a plan to march all of the haftling, the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> people from <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> to a <span class="dlf">quarry</span>, a big <span class="dlf">quarry</span>, down south near the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span>, which, I understand, had been prepared with explosives. </sentence><sentence id="234">And to march them into this <span class="dlf">quarry</span> and then blow the whole thing up. </sentence><sentence id="235">But the 3rd Army was approaching and at a certain critical moment, the Germans decided they weren't going to risk the arrival of the Americans, and they simply dropped the whole project. </sentence><sentence id="236">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="237">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="238"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Left the Jews where they were standing and took off. </sentence><sentence id="239">And, <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> had also what is described as ""<span class="building">aussencommandos</span>" that is, branches of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> where Jews were sent in various <span class="populated place">villages</span> and <span class="populated place">towns</span> in what's called <span class="populated place">Oberbayern</span>, that is <span class="region">Southern Bavaria</span>, to work as farmers on <span class="env feature">farmland</span> under the supervision of the owners. </sentence><sentence id="240">Or in some cases, in <span class="building">factories</span>, or some cases, directly in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">But, so we had a lot of Jews scattered over the <span class="env feature">landscape</span> between <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">Little <span class="populated place">towns</span> like <span class="populated place">Mittenwalde</span>, which is a famous <span class="populated place">violin town</span>, had Jews working there in various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="243">And they suffered, you know, they were not fed well. </sentence><sentence id="244">They were beaten, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="245">But it was not an <span class="building">extermination center</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">So, those people came into <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, a lot of them, and many of them, stayed in those <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">And we would reach out to them from our <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">Anyway, this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was just recently set up, and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from <span class="country">Poland</span>, from <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">Jews who may have, who were mostly in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> during the war. </sentence><sentence id="250"> And I think Jewish agencies, important Jewish agencies, like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA, who were to assign some of their people, welfare workers and others to our teams, to help the international personnel administer the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and to provide services. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Not in our <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">There were a tremendous number of Polish nationals, Ukrainian nationals, Balts, and other, Yugoslavs. </sentence><sentence id="298">And their place, origins in <span class="country">Germany</span> are in a shadow. </sentence><sentence id="299">Nobody is quite sure what they came from, but we suspect that many of them came voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="300">Many of the Ukrainians, for example, had fought in Vlasov's army, that is a Ukrainian army which had deserted <span class="populated place">Angren</span> and totally deserted. </sentence><sentence id="301">The Russians threw off the uniforms and fought in SS uniforms against the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, against Soviet military. </sentence><sentence id="302">But a lot of war criminals, we suspect, people who had some culpability, who were involved in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>, who came, and many who were not. </sentence><sentence id="303">Many who were simple farm workers or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="304">There were many Russian -- former Russian POWs in there. </sentence><sentence id="305">And they had suffered, also, very badly at the hands of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="306">I attended a <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> trial of SS who were accused of exterminating literally thousands of Russian prisoners of war in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="307">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="308"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, and in other places. </sentence><sentence id="309">Well, anyway, they all came. </sentence><sentence id="310">We're faced with the problem of integrating these people into a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, setting up a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">That was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="312">We had emptied all these <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">The Germans had taken everything they could carry, I think, in the <span class="dlf">line</span> of <span class="spatial object">bedding</span> and other personal supplies, but they had to leave their <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">They were taken out, I think, in 24 hours in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="315">So it was a tough time for them. </sentence><sentence id="316">And we had a staff, we had to find people among the Jews to staff the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">There were some school-age children brought in. </sentence><sentence id="318">We had to find doctors, nurses, cooks, <span class="building">stores</span>, office people, who would distribute food and clothing, blankets. </sentence><sentence id="319">And we had to assign, we had to create a system of assigning a lot of people to <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320"> And nobody was satisfied because it was so packed and so jammed. </sentence><sentence id="321">We had really violated health standards and all of the rest to get them in, but the situation was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="322">Snow on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and people starving, very hungry, but we got them all in. </sentence><sentence id="323">We staffed the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">We had very devoted international personnel. </sentence><sentence id="325">We had a number of women who worked as welfare workers, Jewish women. </sentence><sentence id="326">We had a big problem with Jewish women because they became so emotional - - so emotionally involved with the problems in their interviews with Jews, what had happened to them, and where had they been, and what had happened, what they had seen -- that we were rotating people. </sentence><sentence id="327">Sometimes people couldn't stay more than a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="328">It was a very, very difficult time emotionally for them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Yeah, we had men, also, but I remember that the welfare workers were women. </sentence><sentence id="367">I told you, I recall one was Rose Wasserman, a wonderful lady who came from <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">And she was with, I think, it's <span class="building">Cuyahoga County Courts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">She was the chief welfare officer in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">And she did a wonderful job with <span class="building">UNRRA</span> -- <span class="building">UNRRA</span> , yeah. </sentence><sentence id="371">And then we had to provide food. </sentence><sentence id="372">Now food, under an agreement made with the military, was a responsibility of the Germans to provide food, and also to provide money, marks, to pay workers. </sentence><sentence id="373">We had salaried workers. </sentence><sentence id="374">The problem with the marks was that they were worthless. </sentence><sentence id="375">I think, from a nominal value, I think of four to the dollar before the war. </sentence><sentence id="376">A few years later, they were selling for 400 a dollar, and they went up to 4000 a dollar. </sentence><sentence id="377">They were really worthless. </sentence><sentence id="378">But it was important to get them on the worker's list because you did get better -- more calories. </sentence><sentence id="379">We had a specific, specified calorie count that we fed the families. </sentence><sentence id="380">And so you got more calories. </sentence><sentence id="381">And then there were some other privileges for people who This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="382">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="383"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were working. </sentence><sentence id="384">We had a limited number of jobs, you know, a place like <span class="populated place">Neu Freimann</span>, with about 2,500 people. </sentence><sentence id="385">We maybe had 200 or 300, maybe 400 people. </sentence><sentence id="386">There were people who would load wood for firewood, cooks, <span class="building">stores</span> of various sorts. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="422">A: Yeah no, yeah, well, the jobs went based on the gender attached to the job. </sentence><sentence id="423">That is, a Arankenschwester was a kranken nurse, you know, was a woman. </sentence><sentence id="424">We had some nurses. </sentence><sentence id="425">You know, you'd never see a man who was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="426"> All of the doctors were men, the dentists were men, one or two exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="427">And the women were clerks. </sentence><sentence id="428">They helped people fill out their DP documents. </sentence><sentence id="429">I will talk about those in a moment. </sentence><sentence id="430">And there were people who did various clerical tasks, and that was where women could produce, could contribute. </sentence><sentence id="431">We also had a <span class="building">relegazerampt</span> we called it, a <span class="building">religious office</span>, and some of these <span class="building">houses</span> were reserved for <span class="building">synagogues</span> in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="432">They're small <span class="building">houses</span>, and so we had <span class="building">Rusisha shul</span>, <span class="building">Russian shul</span>, and a <span class="building">Poylissha shul</span>, a <span class="building">Polish synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">There were two or three, four maybe different <span class="dlf">branches</span>, and they were separate. </sentence><sentence id="434">And people knew where they wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="435">We had to find rabbis, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="436">I had an American assistant who went around looking for people with beards, and they were designated rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="437">These Jews, by the way, the <span class="populated place">Hasidic Jewish community</span>, and we had some that came, were clearly identifiable. </sentence><sentence id="438">We wondered, you know, how they'd made it through the war, but they were in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> during the war. </sentence><sentence id="439">And then we began the distribution of food. </sentence><sentence id="440">We set up <span class="interior space">community kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="441">Now, these <span class="building">houses</span> had <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> so that people could cook, take their food and cook as they pleased. </sentence><sentence id="442">And then we had a <span class="interior space">community kitchen</span> where we had people come who were single, who had no family, to eat their three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="443">We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for the purpose of salaries. </sentence><sentence id="444">We had to justify all the salaries. </sentence><sentence id="445">And the religious ampt I remember, gave us a problem because they needed people to erect an eruwv -- this <span class="dlf">wire</span> around, you know about it, around the <span class="populated place">town</span> during the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="446">I remember this colonel saying, "What is that? </sentence><sentence id="447">What kind

</sentence><sentence id="450">What are you talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="451">Ultimately, when we built a <span class="building">mikvah</span> in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">I remember I had to explain the meaning of a <span class="building">mikvah</span> and why they had people who did certain personal -- I am not sure what happens in a <span class="building">mikvah</span>, but they rendered personal service, clipping toenails. </sentence><sentence id="453">Someone was kidding me, he said, takes lint out of the <span class="interior space">navels</span>, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="454">They were all paid for. </sentence><sentence id="455">And, then, we had some special food habits, you know, for the Hassidim needed kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="456">And we had a real problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="457"> I don't remember how we solved it. </sentence><sentence id="458">I think we went to a <span class="building">butcher</span>, a German place where meat was slaughtered, and we had a -- what do you call the guy who does the slaughtering? </sentence><sentence id="459">I am forgetting my Yiddish, you know -- who slaughters the animals. </sentence><sentence id="460">And he was a hasid. </sentence><sentence id="461">And the meat was taken, carefully handled. </sentence><sentence id="462">Milk for lactating mothers, those women who were pregnant, the cows had to be milked under supervision by a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="463">They assigned somebody to go and sit in the <span class="building">barn</span> with the -- we had to provide transportation. </sentence><sentence id="464">It was a very complex thing. </sentence><sentence id="465">We had a lot of illness. </sentence><sentence id="466">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="467">They were taken out, weaned out, and we sent them to - - we had a <span class="building">tuberculosis center</span> in <span class="populated place">Bad Reichenhall</span>, nearby. </sentence><sentence id="468">We had medical examinations. </sentence><sentence id="469">There was a big problem with bad teeth. </sentence><sentence id="470">Now, we issued DP cards, identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="471">So they had an identity card from the United Nations with a thumb print, no pictures, a finger print. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was also a DP card kept in our <span class="spatial object">files</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">Now these people arrived mostly after December and when they arrived, they were not aware that the Truman Directive, signed in early December, I think, which allocated a large number of visa numbers. </sentence><sentence id="474">The military was very wary about infiltrees, about the increasing number of people coming from <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">And the British also understood that the larger the number of Jewish displaced persons in the <span class="region">American zones</span>, that the greater the pressure would be on them in the <span class="building">United Nations</span> and in other forums to relinquish the mandate in <span class="country">Palestine</span> or part of the mandate for the Jews, or to admit more Jews into <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="476">Something they did not wish to do. </sentence><sentence id="477">So the Americans, who didn't want DPs generally, General Patton was in command in that <span class="region">area</span>, and he was not terribly sympathetic to the Jews, tried to shut them off from coming by, declaring that in order to emigrate from the <span class="region">American zones</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span>, you had to show that you had arrived in the <span class="region">zone</span> prior to December 22, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="478">And so, these people who came in January, they were not aware of this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="479">And they gave accurately that they had arrived in January or early February and that their place of birth was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, a place not favored

id="482">They would have to sit in <span class="country">Europe</span> for years before they got out. </sentence><sentence id="483">But they were being truthful, and they said who they were and when they came and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="484">Later on, they found to their unhappiness, that disqualified them. </sentence><sentence id="485">They said, "Had I known, I would have told them I came here earlier." </sentence><sentence id="486">We thought about it, by the way I've used the metaphor, you know, it was December 22 which they made the cutoff date, that on the 25th where Christmas was celebrated, there was no <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="building">inn</span>, our <span class="building">inn</span>, for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="487">And anyway, we got them all into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we created our own health programs, under the supervision of international medical people, and our own feeding programs, our own <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">Right away, the Jews were energetic. </sentence><sentence id="489">They set up everything they needed, cultural programs, newspapers began to sprout. </sentence><sentence id="490">Now, prior to that time, there was a question early on at the end of the war, how would these people be housed, the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="491">They were, after all, multi-national -- Poles and Ukrainians and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="492">And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish, Polish nationals. </sentence><sentence id="493">And so therefore, they would take a whole bunch of Poles, Polish speaking people, and put them, try to put them into one <span class="populated place">camp</span>, into one <span class="region">area</span>, under one administration. </sentence><sentence id="494">But, you know, the Jews did not consider themselves Polish anymore. </sentence><sentence id="495">They would not opt in a legal sense, for that identity. </sentence><sentence id="496">And so, they -- I am not quite sure how it happened -- but they all declared themselves, I think maybe for immigration purposes, as staatenlos that is, stateless, or as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="497">Now, there was a great deal of jockeying around over how the Jews would be housed, whether they would be housed among the people, as I say, of the <span class="country">countries</span> in which they were born, which they didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="498">American-Jewish leaders were also, I think, playing a role in that thing. </sentence><sentence id="499">And they wanted all of the Jews together, which was a wise thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="500">And ultimately, the <span class="building">military</span> gave in. </sentence><sentence id="501">For them, you know, looking directly at it, or for the United Nations looking directly at it, these were Poles or Latvians or Lithuanians. </sentence><sentence id="502"> But, no, they did not consider themselves that. </sentence><sentence id="503">And so they all became of one national group. </sentence><sentence id="504">And in all of the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> in which Jews lived after the war, they lived together, surrounded by a <span class="dlf">fence</span>, whose perimeter was often patrolled by Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="505">We organized the <span class="building">police force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="506">We had a <span class="building">police force</span> in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> alone of over 100 people. </sentence><sentence id="507">They were not armed police, but they were Jews who wore armbands declaring that they were policemen, and they patrolled the perimeters of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="508">Conditions were so bad in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">At this time, I was the supply officer for <span class="populated place">Neu Freimann camp</span> and all of the

<span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="513">In effect, I became ultimately sort of the mayor of the Jewish community of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">And they would come to our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">They were Polish Jews, mostly. </sentence><sentence id="516">There were very few German Jews remaining in -- just a very few that I ran across, who would come to us for food, identity papers certifying that they were stateless, or that they had been persecutees, and therefore, entitled to certain privileges as to immigration, food, medical care, clothing, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="517">And as I say, conditions were so bad that in the <span class="country">United States</span>, the <span class="building">White House</span> was hearing about it. </sentence><sentence id="518">There was a lot of anguish, a lot of anger, and so Eisenhower was sent by Truman to Europe to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="519">There had been a report by the Harrison Committee which had stressed some of these inadequacies, but Eisenhower went over to look, he said, for himself. </sentence><sentence id="520">And what happened was, a week before he arrived in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, the director of our <span class="populated place">camps</span> quit. </sentence><sentence id="521">He wanted to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="522">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="523">Anyway, and so I was called by <span class="building">UNRRA</span> saying would I make myself ready to receive the General and to brief him on whatever questions he wanted to be raised. </sentence><sentence id="524">And sure enough, two or three days before the arrival of the General, all of the security people, military security people, came and checked the whole <span class="dlf">road</span> running down to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Munich</span> out to this <span class="populated

riding in -- it had to be either Goering or Hitler's <span class="spatial object">car</span> -- a great big <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="528">And he was accompanied, of course, by six or eight general officers. </sentence><sentence id="529">You were going to ask something? </sentence><sentence id="530"><span class="populated place">McNarney</span> was among them, <span class="populated place">Huebner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="531">I remember those names. </sentence><sentence id="532">And they came into the <span class="populated

<span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="534">And we talked about supplies. </sentence><sentence id="535">He went and looked at it. </sentence><sentence id="536">We talked about <span class="building">housing</span>; he went and looked at the <span class="building">housing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="537">He talked to the people. </sentence><sentence id="538">A

impressed. </sentence><sentence id="540">He's a very stern-looking guy, very impressive you know, with all of those stars. </sentence><sentence id="541">And some of his staff took notes on what I was saying. </sentence><sentence id="542">And I think it had an impact, my own contribution to that, because within a matter of maybe a month, things began to improve. </sentence><sentence id="543">We were getting things that we were not getting before. </sentence><sentence id="544">Of course, the <span class="building">White House</span> had played its role, but Eisenhower coming over there was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: Well, I could talk pretty honestly. </sentence><sentence id="684">I just told him, "General, the situation's tragic. </sentence><sentence id="685">We have people, you know, stuffed into a <span class="interior space">room</span> together in such numbers -- the people are sick, their ability to resist disease is down. </sentence><sentence id="686">And so, we are going to have typhus. </sentence><sentence id="687">We are going to have this, and we're going to have that. </sentence><sentence id="688">They are not getting adequate food." </sentence><sentence id="689">And he listened carefully. </sentence><sentence id="690">I remember, though, some funny scenes. </sentence><sentence id="691">We took him into a <span class="building">school</span>, a <span class="building">Yiddish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="692">And the guy who was the director of that <span class="building">school</span> was a fellow who then went to <span class="populated place">Baltimore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">His name was Spector. </sentence><sentence id="694">Mr. Spector was a teacher, and both he and his wife were dedicated. </sentence><sentence id="695">He and his wife were wonderfully dedicated people. </sentence><sentence id="696">They set up the <span class="building">school</span> with teachers, and the children, they got paper and they got pencils. </sentence><sentence id="697">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="698">I told you "<span class="building">IMCA</span>" <span class="building">YMCA</span> supplied us with writing pads for the Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="699">And he had coached the children to sing "The Star Spangled Banner", in just learning the <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">They didn't know what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="701">And Eisenhower stood there, you know, his hat under his arm, and he listened as they sang. </sentence><sentence id="702">And when it was finished, I was stunned. </sentence><sentence id="703">I didn't tell Spector until much later. </sentence><sentence id="704">He said to me, "What are they singing?" </sentence><sentence id="705">He didn't recognize it at all. </sentence><sentence id="706">I wouldn't spoil what these children had done. </sentence><sentence id="707">There was also some confusion. </sentence><sentence id="708">He walked into a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, I remember, and he took his hat off, you know. </sentence><sentence id="709">And McNarney leaned over him and says, "General, put your hat on. </sentence><sentence id="710">You're in a <span class="building">synagogue</span>." </sentence><sentence id="711">It was a pleasant visit. </sentence><sentence id="712">The Jews were extremely welcoming to him, applauded. </sentence><sentence id="713">He was the great hero who had liberated them. </sentence><sentence id="714">And it was a wonderful day. </sentence><sentence id="715">He is a stern-looking guy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="716">He has his dignity, very little joking around with him, my impression. </sentence><sentence id="717">I wouldn't want to cross him, based on what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="718">Anyway, the visit went well. </sentence><sentence id="719">And as a result, as a matter of fact, in about a couple of weeks, I was notified that I had been appointed director to replace the departed director. </sentence><sentence id="720">And, that situation went on for, I think, until 1947 when we learned that <span class="building">UNRRA</span> was going to be terminated, go out of business. </sentence><sentence id="721">And that it was to be replaced by an agency known as the <span class="building">PCIRO</span>, Preparatory Committee or Commission for the International Refugee Organization. </sentence><sentence id="722">And that a new modus operandi was to take place. </sentence><sentence id="723">That is, many of the international personnel on our team were to be terminated. </sentence><sentence id="724">And their responsibilities were to be turned over to indigenous staff-people, essentially, the Jews themselves, in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="725">And there would be no camp director for a given <span class="populated place">camp</span>;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: Well, there was some pressure. </sentence><sentence id="953">Yeah, the <span class="building">Jewish Agency</span> was working in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and they did a valuable job. </sentence><sentence id="954">And the whole leadership of the Jewish community was Zionist in its orientation. </sentence><sentence id="955">So that when, for example, camp administrations were made up, as I've indicated, they were elected on Zionist lists. </sentence><sentence id="956">Liste eyns, or <span class="spatial object">tsvey</span> -- list one, two. </sentence><sentence id="957">And on that basis, these represented various Zionist political parties. </sentence><sentence id="958">There was a strong, and I think the Jewish Agency and the leaders, Ben Gurion and the rest understood, the value of the DP, Jewish DP community and the experience which the Jews had had -- if you want to call it a value. </sentence><sentence id="959">But they understood the meaning of it, for bringing pressure against the British and the <span class="country">United States</span> to partition <span class="country">Palestine</span> or to create a Jewish entity, and to allow the Jews to leave. </sentence><sentence id="960">And for the <span class="building">United Nations</span>, by the way, ultimately when they did go legally, the <span class="building">UN</span> paid all fares for transportation costs for Jewish refugees travelling to whatever destination they were going to. </sentence><sentence id="961">So there was a unity within the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="962">And they would never allow it to be understood

men and women to serve in the <span class="building">Haganah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="970">They were trained in our <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="971">They would be marching around and training with broomsticks as bayonets, rifles. </sentence><sentence id="972">So they were preparing themselves. </sentence><sentence id="973">But as I say, you had this tension in the <span class="populated place">community</span> which is, I think, something which happens today, again, you have in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> some of the same things, that is, <span class="country">Israel</span> accuses HIAS, Jewish agencies, of talking Jews into not going to <span class="country">Israel</span>, which is absolutely untrue. </sentence><sentence id="974">Jews know where they wish to go. </sentence><sentence id="975">And my own feeling is they should go where they wish to go, where they will be happy. </sentence><sentence id="976">So we had that immigration. </sentence><sentence id="977">Then we had the illegal immigration. </sentence><sentence id="978">I was, I think, the only Jewish camp director I know of in <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1108">Q: What made you do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Well, I was Jewish, and my sense of solidarity with my people, with the people, you know, around me. </sentence><sentence id="1111">I was profoundly sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Then, well, there was also the question of how do you get around the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Now, Jews would apply for immigration to the

under that national origins quota. </sentence><sentence id="1124">These numbers -- Germans who could not use these quota numbers had to stay, and the numbers were saved up and they were turned over to the DPs by the Truman Directive to be used. </sentence><sentence id="1125">All of these used up numbers going back to 1939, or thereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So that relieved some of the problems. </sentence><sentence id="1127">But the point was, they still operated under the national origins quota, very restrictive. </sentence><sentence id="1128">And under the requirement that they be in a <span class="region">zone</span> December 22nd of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So what happened was such people, if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Nobody knew the difference. </sentence><sentence id="1131"> I was in control of these things. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And put a new DP card in the file. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And I remember in one <span class="building">office</span>, we had a guy who was an expert at aging these documents. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Of course, they had to be about two or three years old, you know, so if you saw a fresh, the paper was lousy, if you saw a fresh white paper, you knew it was fresh. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So we had them stacked on <span class="spatial object">radiators</span> to age them a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And then they would bring these papers in, and it didn't take long before the consul generals, they are pretty bright people, understood that there was something not kosher about these. </sentence><sentence id="1137">A lot of people came in, declared they were born in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but had no German accent. </sentence><sentence id="1138">You know, they spoke strong Yiddish, and there was some

class="populated place">Neu Freimann</span> was considered a privileged <span class="populated place">camp</span> because it was right on the <span class="dlf">border</span> of <span class="populated

id="1173">There was the <span class="building">Jewish Agency</span>, <span class="building">JAFP</span>, Jewish Agency for Palestine, with Chaim Hoffman as its director. </sentence><sentence

id="1176">I mean, it was open to all. </sentence><sentence id="1177">The <span class="building">black market</span> was not a Jewish making, it was a creation of the German merchants who were backed up with merchandise, which they were beginning to produce. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And they could not sell and make anything unless they sold it on the <span class="building">black market</span>, because the controlled price in German marks, what you would get would be zero. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I could get four <span class="spatial object">opera seats</span> for two cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="1180"><span class="spatial object">Opera seats</span> had a nominal value of, let's say, 20 marks apiece. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So the <span

the 2,000 calories a person, especially what those calories were made of. </sentence><sentence id="1184">They were made of potatoes and starchy <span class="env feature">haferflocken</span>, which was a German term for a wheat, a cereal of some sort, dried eggs, dried skim milk. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Jews could not eat dried eggs. </sentence><sentence id="1186">That stuff used to lie and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2403">A: Well, we would go occasionally on vacations. </sentence><sentence id="2404">But the only place that I could go with some regularity -- we'd get away maybe once every couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="2405">If you look at your <span class="spatial object">map</span>, you could see we were about three or four hours from <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, from the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And we'd drive down to <span class="populated place">Konstanz</span>, which is the <span class="populated place">border town</span> on the <span class="dlf">Swiss German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And from there, about another 30 miles to <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And there was just an incredible change, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Schlagsaahner, that's whipped cream and cookies and cakes and chocolate and <span class="building">night clubs</span> and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And you'd spend three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="2411">You thought you were refreshed. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And then, you would come back to the grimness of the horrors. </sentence><sentence id="2413">Occasionally, I would accompany a group of Jews who were being, again, treated for tuberculosis in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I remember that <span class="populated place">Davos</span> was the place, the <span class="dlf">site</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2415">Have you heard of <span class="populated place">Davos</span>, <span class="dlf">D-a-v-o-s</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2416">Now I hear about it in ski contests. </sentence><sentence id="2417">It's a <span class="populated place">resort city</span> and they hold ski meets there. </sentence><sentence id="2418">But <span class="populated place">Davos</span> was a place with a number of <span class="building">sanitoriums</span>, and the Jews stayed there to recover. </sentence><sentence id="2419">And then they were sent back. </sentence><sentence id="2420"><span class="building">UNRRA</span> paid the bill in <span class="populated place">Davos</span> and <span class="populated place">Malmo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2421">You have heard of <span class="populated place">Malmo</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2422">Where is that, <span class="country">Norway</span> or <span class="country">Sweden</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2423"><span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2424">I have to say something about the <span class="building">international organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2425"><span class="populated place">Malmo</span> -- I mean, all of the processing of Jews, that is, was paid for, the welfare and their migration, their tickets were bought, to <span class="country">Israel</span> when it was established, to the <span class="country">United States</span>, to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2426">Their medical care in <span class="country">foreign countries</span> when that became vital, when people were thought to be able to be helped. </sentence><sentence id="2427">So it was a great humanitarian service. </sentence><sentence id="2428"> I know that many of our people here, <span class="building">UNRRA</span>, think of the <span class="region">Arab states</span> and the refugee problem and there is a negative feeling about the <span class="country">U.N.</span>, generally. </sentence><sentence id="2429">You know, the <span class="country">U.N.</span> intrudes -- especially on the basis of the <span class="country">U.N.</span> -- the <span class="region">Middle Eastern</span> situation. </sentence><sentence id="2430">But they can be eternally grateful to the <span class="building">United Nations</span> to <span class="building">UNRRA</span>, for the great service which they rendered to the Jewish people as well as other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2431">But the Jews especially. </sentence><sentence id="2432">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2463">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about the <span class="building">black market</span>, both looked like a solution to a lot of problems, but I suspect it also generated its own problems? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2465">A: Terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2466">I think the <span class="building">black market</span>, more than anything else I can think of, generated hostility towards the Jewish community as it then existed in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, among the military and among, I think, Germans, generally. </sentence><sentence id="2467">And the newspaper people would come over from the <span class="country">United States</span> and want to know about "the <span class="building">black market</span>" This is a verbatim

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 because I think it was publicized here in the <span class="country">United States</span>, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And we were very sensitive about it. </sentence><sentence id="2471">UNRRA was told that a number one priority of the occupation immediately after the end of the war was the reconstruction of <span class="country">Germany</span>'s economy, which was smashed. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And Eisenhower and the people that came after him, and in particular, John McCloy, General Clay, all made that a number one priority. </sentence><sentence id="2473">And therefore, the diversion of goods, of manufactured goods, and food from the regular <span class="building">market</span> was considered a very great threat to the economy. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And measures were to be taken against it, police measures. </sentence><sentence id="2475">At the same time, the people who were withholding these goods -- if you walked into a <span class="building">German shop</span>, <span class="building">camera store</span>, for example -- until the currency was reformed, that <span class="building">store</span> lay absolutely empty of any merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="2476">You couldn't buy food. </sentence><sentence id="2477">You couldn't buy clothing because the clothing had to be sold at regulated prices, and the mark, the reichsmark, which was still the old <span class="building">reich</span> before the <span class="dlf">d-mark</span>, was practically worthless. </sentence><sentence id="2478">I mean, it went to like 800 to a dollar at one point, so that the Germans would not sell their goods on the <span class="building">open market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2479">That is, on the regular <span class="building">market</span> under controlled prices, because they would be losing their shirts. </sentence><sentence id="2480">And it was only to be bought with hard currencies: dollars, or Swiss francs, or British pounds, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2481">Now, for the Jews, the <span class="building">black market</span> was the only place. </sentence><sentence id="2482">These were people who had come out of the most terrible conditions, in <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>, either <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> or in hiding, or in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> where there was nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves, to rebuild their families. </sentence><sentence id="2484">They were producing children, doing all of these things, and the <span class="building">black market</span> became the only way in which they could meet that need. </sentence><sentence id="2485"> And, also, to produce some income for them, so that when they went overseas to the <span class="country">country</span> in which they would settle, they would have a few dollars in their pockets. </sentence><sentence id="2486">And so this <span class="building">black market</span> developed. </sentence><sentence id="2487">It took the form very frequently of little <span class="building">shops</span> in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>, thriving in <span class="populated place">Feldafing</span>, <span class="populated place">Foehrenwald</span>, <span class="populated place">Neu Freimann</span> also. </sentence><sentence id="2488">You could buy most anything you needed or wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Food, cloth for making clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2490">The joke was, you could get anything you want -- You couldn't get anything you want, but you could get a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="2491">And it thrived. </sentence><sentence id="2492">Now, the military authorities knew about it, and they would launch raids on the <span class="populated place">camps</span> to grab these people in the act. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And early in the morning, maybe about 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they would surround the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> with <span class="spatial object">armed vehicles</span>, and they would go marching in there looking for contraband: cigarettes, coffee, all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2494">I remember a funny story about how this stuff got into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> at <span class="populated place">Foehrenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2495">There's a big <span class="building">meat market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2496">The question is, where do you get meat in a <span class="building">market</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2497">Now, we discovered the meat was gotten in this way: garbage was collected by <span class="building">German firms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2498">And they didn't use <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, they used sort of <span class="spatial object">sledges</span>, which were dragged along the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, no wheels, just like <span class="spatial object">sleighs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And they were pulled by two oxen; they would come into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with two oxen. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And then, the same <span class="spatial object">sledge</span> would emerge with one ox. </sentence><sentence id="2501">Then for a few days, there would be meat, kosher meat in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2502">But in any case, in the event of a raid in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the United Nations had to receive prior notice from the military. </sentence><sentence id="2503">No military people could enter a <span class="building">United

receive a call from the colonel in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> saying, "Mr. Sorrin, tomorrow morning at 7:00 o'clock, we are going to be entering your <span class="populated place">camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2507">And of course, now, 40 or 50 years later, I am free to say it -- I would call up and tell Haim Yankel or the president of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, tomorrow is going to be a razzia, a raid. </sentence><sentence id="2508">You know, I could not abide these -- I mean, I was sympathetic with what the Jews were trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="2509">I had no participation in it, but I would just tell them, if you don't want to be raided, put your stuff out of sight. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And that thrived. </sentence><sentence id="2511"> And I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="2512">And the military did not, from their vantage point, nor did the United Nations authorities. </sentence><sentence id="2513">They were simply obeying the mandate of the military government. </sentence><sentence id="2514">But without that, it would have been tragic for Jewish families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2569">Q: What happened between Jews, because obviously, some people were more entrepreneurial and others were not so entrepreneurial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="2572">Some people made a lot of money, but most people made a little money, enough to get along. </sentence><sentence id="2573">But we used to hear that some people made big deals. </sentence><sentence id="2574">Now, I want to also mention that very often, involved in these big deals were members of the armed forces themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2575">That is, some of the <span class="building">PX</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2576">people who had access to cigarettes and coffee from the P.X. They didn't have to steal it. </sentence><sentence id="2577">It was charged out as purchased in some way, and it ended up in a <span class="building">black market</span> operation. </sentence><sentence id="2578">And these <span class="building">black market</span> operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because <span class="country">Germany</span> was vulnerable, its economic system was vulnerable, because of the war, to that kind of activity. </sentence><sentence id="2579">What happened here in the <span class="country">United States</span>, if you went to go buy a <span class="spatial object">camera</span>, let's say, for $400, and each dollar is worth a tenth of what its value is, so that you're really buying it for $40 dollars, or maybe even $4 when the mark really went down, the people producing these <span class="spatial object">cameras</span> are going to take them off the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> and wait for someone to come in with another currency. </sentence><sentence id="2580">But then a real act of genius occurred, a genius on the part of the <span class="country">United States</span> and their economic planners. </sentence><sentence id="2581">When the war was over, the currency which was in use was reichsmarks. </sentence><sentence id="2582">And a lot of their currency had pictures of German emperors on them, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2583">But some of them, many of them had Hitler and Goering and Goebbels and people like that. </sentence><sentence id="2584">That money was discarded. </sentence><sentence id="2585">But the other currency, the old currency was still in circulation, and it was subject to extraordinary fluctuation because of the <span class="building">black market</span> situation. </sentence><sentence id="2586">Now, a decision was taken by the military government in connection with the finance leaders of <span class="region">West Germany</span> at the time -- Conrad Adenauer was the chancellor of <span class="country">Germany</span> -- to change the currency, to completely abandon the <span class="spatial object">reichsmarks</span>, and to substitute <span class="dlf">d-marks</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="2587">And this had to be done secretly, because if it got out, there would be all kinds of dislocations. </sentence><sentence id="2588">All kinds of things would happen if this was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2589"> It was no secret, by the way.

</sentence><sentence id="2593">But what happened was that for a couple of weeks before the day of the currency reform, which I think took place in "48, <span class="building">black market</span> goods disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2594">You couldn't buy, because nobody knew what the price would be. </sentence><sentence id="2595">And the people were withholding it, waiting for the new currency to come on <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2596">And that was a period of enormous restlessness in the <span class="populated place">Jewish DP camps</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2597">I guess it must have been out in the general society, but in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, I could -- we could see the tension rising. </sentence><sentence id="2598">There were fights. </sentence><sentence id="2599">There was a small riot in some <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2600">They had all kinds of problems, because you couldn't get anything to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2601">And people had to feed themselves and their families. </sentence><sentence id="2602">And then on a given day, an announcement was put up, broadcast through the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and the currency reform began. </sentence><sentence id="2603">Now, what they did was -- I am trying to remember -- everybody got, I think, 10 marks, or maybe it was 100 marks. </sentence><sentence id="2604">If you had 10 million dollars stashed in old currency, it was worthless to you. </sentence><sentence id="2605">You could just burn it in the <span class="spatial object">furnace</span> because you got the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2606">Every individual got the same amount in <span class="dlf">d-marks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And it was a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2608">By the way, the Germans had a word for it, wirtschaft wunder, economic wonder, economic miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2609">Within days, the <span class="building">shops</span> filled with merchandise, cameras, food, cakes, meat, cookies. </sentence><sentence id="2610">You could buy whatever you wanted, clothing, just in a matter of weeks, because the <span class="dlf">d-marks</span> were around, and people suddenly had lots of <span class="dlf">d-marks</span>, even though they were distributed in this democratic way. </sentence><sentence id="2611">And that began <span class="country">Germany</span>'s real economic recovery, and changed entirely the nature of the <span class="building">black market</span> -- it disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2612">It was no longer a viable instrument, you know, for doing business in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2613">Before, during the days of the <span class="building">black market</span>, it was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="2614">Otherwise, you would not move anything. </sentence><sentence id="2615">So I remember that day. </sentence><sentence id="2616">We had to supervise. </sentence><sentence id="2617">We went
