<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name Sol Fox. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now it's <span class="building">Sol Fox</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">It was in Polish, where we lived before, Shlomick Fuchs. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born September 2, 1922 in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> to a very, very well to do family. </sentence><sentence id="7">We were seven children. </sentence><sentence id="8">We were seven children, one sister and six brothers. </sentence><sentence id="9">I was amongst the two youngest. </sentence><sentence id="10">The distance between me and my next brother was four years. </sentence><sentence id="11">Therefore they already were involved in the family business, while I and my younger brother were going to this very famous <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">If I might explain at this moment, what it meant to get a <span class="building">high school</span> education where we come from. </sentence><sentence id="13">In this <span class="country">country</span> it's compulsory to have a <span class="building">high school</span> education. </sentence><sentence id="14">Where we come from in <span class="country">Poland</span>, only seven classes of <span class="building">basic school</span>, you call it <span class="building">Public school</span>, was  compulsory. </sentence><sentence id="15"><span class="building">High School</span> was either private or they also had governmental subsidized, taxpayers subsidized <span class="building">high schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">Those accepted only two percent of a small percentage of Jewish students, and they had to be the best. </sentence><sentence id="17">Therefore, to afford to go to <span class="building">high school</span>, you had to had support of a family that could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="18">It was expensive. </sentence><sentence id="19">Almost all in my family did have education at <span class="building">high school</span> education and me and my younger brother who went together, that was a big expense for my parents. </sentence><sentence id="20">In this way, I'm paying homage to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="21">A very bright future was in sight that my father, should he rest in peace, planned particularly for me. </sentence><sentence id="22">Not that I'm trying to point myself out that I was an exceptional son, which was not true at all, because my younger brother was the darling of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">He was much smarter and better student, but my father had planned at least one of his sons to become an angromomist and go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">That was supposed to be me. </sentence><sentence id="25">So, by that I'm trying to stress the fact how this <span class="building">Holocaust business</span> broke lives from the <span class="dlf">Shoresh</span>, in Hebrew it means from the root. </sentence><sentence id="26">I am glad I injected a Hebrew word. </sentence><sentence id="27">So, we had a normal, beautiful, very beautiful life. </sentence><sentence id="28">My parents, as I say, were well to do people. </sentence><sentence id="29">I might add at this point that my mother and my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="30">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="31"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection grandfather, I come from a <span class="building">religious home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">My father was dressed religiously, not any more the children. </sentence><sentence id="33">We started to get modernized. </sentence><sentence id="34">But my grandfather even owned his own <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">The <span class="building">synagogue</span> that we were praying in, it was like a private <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">I'm not talking about a big building <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was like in his <span class="building">private home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">He was a wealthy man, and he owned the <span class="building">building</span>, so he allowed one <span class="interior space">room</span> for prayers only on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="39">Himself, my parents, were going for like you go here to <span class="populated place">Sarasota</span>, you know, to <span class="interior space">baths</span>, will that be explainable? </sentence><sentence id="40">To <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span>, <span class="populated place">Francisbad</span>, <span class="populated place">Karlsbad</span>, and when they came back they had the biggest praise. </sentence><sentence id="41">They were doing that for many years before Hitler, before Nazism. </sentence><sentence id="42">So, when this thing came on us, the shock was yet bigger, because my parents and my grandfather, and anybody who ever had contact with the German people, couldn't understand what happened. </sentence><sentence id="43">How could they turn into, and I must say it, and I promised myself on one of the notes, I would not be sarcastic and I will not be insulting to <span class="country">Germany</span> as it is, not as I knew before. </sentence><sentence id="44">I don't know how they are now. </sentence><sentence id="45">I really don't. </sentence><sentence id="46">But, how could they have changed into --- oh, oh, see I lost my thought. </sentence><sentence id="47">Sometimes we say when somebody is bad you say he's vicious. </sentence><sentence id="48">He's worse than an animal. </sentence><sentence id="49">Whenever I get to this point, I say I cannot insult the kingdom of animals. </sentence><sentence id="50">I hate to see it, but it really comes out of me. </sentence><sentence id="51">Those Germans, if I would put it at the mildest, not wanted to insult today's Germans, though in doing me a lot of harm already for the last 50 years. </sentence><sentence id="52">I was in <span class="country">Germany</span> only six months. </sentence><sentence id="53">I don't want to insult the kingdom of animals, because they were definitely absolutely worse. </sentence><sentence id="54">You cannot imagine how vicious they were. </sentence><sentence id="55">You cannot imagine the devotion that they had to that Fuehrer. </sentence><sentence id="56">Because I learned German in <span class="building">school</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="57">We learned Hebrew, German, Polish and Latin in our <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">It was multi-language. </sentence><sentence id="59">Polish was the main language. </sentence><sentence id="60">Hebrew was second, German was third. </sentence><sentence id="61">My German teacher was a lady who came from a very religious, <span class="building">Jewish home</span> in our <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, Schneiersohn. </sentence><sentence id="62">Everybody knew the religious family of Schneiersohn. </sentence><sentence id="63">There was nothing wrong with the Schneiersohns to have a daughter speaking and teaching German to students with the deepest German dialect. </sentence><sentence id="64">So, when I have to say it, I know how to and it happened in <span class="building">Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">I had an incident when I said it in deep German and I'll maybe explain later what it was. </sentence><sentence id="66">The way the whole thing done in the most This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="67">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="68"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection murderous, vicious, sadistic, as my teacher said, that he couldn't find words in the world's lexicons, dictionaries to express the viciousness and the pain of the Holocaust experience. </sentence><sentence id="69">I went through <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">Our system had four classes and two which was called <span class="building">Lyceum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">I made  it through the first of <span class="building">Lyceum</span> because the Germans invaded on Friday morning, 5:00, 1939, September 1. </sentence><sentence id="72">On September 2, as you remember I was born on September 2, was my birthday, my 17th birthday. </sentence><sentence id="73">We did not yet realize the scope of the tragedy even if Nazism in <span class="country">Germany</span> started in "33 or even before. </sentence><sentence id="74">We heard things, even if the media was not as developed as today, but we knew, because it was only a <span class="dlf">border</span> away. </sentence><sentence id="75">So, when it came, we knew that a tragedy was coming. </sentence><sentence id="76">We didn't even use the word tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="77">We knew tough times were coming. </sentence><sentence id="78">Bad people are coming. </sentence><sentence id="79">The Germans are hurting us, even killing some, but little did we realize the scope of it. </sentence><sentence id="80">To get as I am saying, to try and tell it is to do injustice to it. </sentence><sentence id="81">It's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="82">Let me try to give you some small instances. </sentence><sentence id="83">My sister was married a year before the war, therefore her baby was born the 26th of August one week before the war. </sentence><sentence id="84">Being that my parents were able to afford, and she married also a very well to do husband, they got an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for her in a very fine <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, and it was equipped to the tee. </sentence><sentence id="85">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="86">She was the only daughter. </sentence><sentence id="87">Q. Was this a Jewish neighborhood?A. This was not the very <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhood</span> where she moved to. </sentence><sentence id="88">She moved sort of like to the <span class="populated place">City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">There were <span class="populated place">Ghetto neighborhood</span>, what we called <span class="populated place">Ghetto neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">I lived ina <span class="populated place">Ghetto neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">I was born there. </sentence><sentence id="92">This was the center of Jewish life in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">Then came the <span class="interior space">business section</span> where we had our <span class="building">business</span>, and my sister lived further down. </sentence><sentence id="94">It was a mixed <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">As a matter of fact, it was diagonally across from my wife's <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">But then we didn't realize it. </sentence><sentence id="97">But, I'm aiming at something. </sentence><sentence id="98">The name, the landlords of that <span class="building">building</span>, were German. </sentence><sentence id="99">The population of our <span class="populated place">city</span> had a lot of Jews, Germans, and Poles. </sentence><sentence id="100">The population was about 900,000 of which 30 percent was Jewish and a lot of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="101">Now, these neighbors were Germans, the Richter family. </sentence><sentence id="102">Very wealthy in the <span class="building">steel industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">As soon as the Germans arrived and we noticed how bad it got and everybody started running in all directions, my father, my parents -- we were still intact, brought my sister and her baby to our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">That This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="105">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="106"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection she shouldn't be alone there, because her husband had to go to attend to his problems. </sentence><sentence id="107">Everybody had problems. </sentence><sentence id="108">When she came back to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, it was empty. </sentence><sentence id="109">Mrs. Richter, the millionaire German landlady, emptied my sister's <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, because it was all new. </sentence><sentence id="110">She was just married. </sentence><sentence id="111">I was chosen by my father because I learned German in <span class="building">school</span>, so he helped himself with me rather than with the other children and not with my younger brother. </sentence><sentence id="112">You see my younger brother's picture there in the back? </sentence><sentence id="113">Because he was still too young. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was already like a man, and I knew the language. </sentence><sentence id="115">He says go ask Mr. Richter what happened. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, I went. </sentence><sentence id="117">I knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was one flight up, left <span class="dlf">door</span>, and she opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and I said Frau Richter, "Wer hat meiner Schwester Moebel "rausgenommen? " </sentence><sentence id="119">Sie sind doch tod" she said to me." </sentence><sentence id="120">I was yesterday at the <span class="building">party meeting</span>." </sentence><sentence id="121">How did I know that she belongs to the party. " </sentence><sentence id="122">We were told that you were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="123">Why do you need <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> so I took it out". </sentence><sentence id="124">Can you imagine anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="125">I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="126">This was the first real shock that went through me. </sentence><sentence id="127">Because the next shock didn't take very long when they confiscated completely our <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">Where we lived, as I said before, was the <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhood</span> where the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was then formed eventually. </sentence><sentence id="129">All the others were pushed in here, and we had to share the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="130">But to come to the story of how fast they liquidated our <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">We had three <span class="building">stores</span>, <span class="building">retail stores</span>, besides wholesale shoes. </sentence><sentence id="132">On the main <span class="dlf">street</span> like here you would say <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span> or <span class="dlf">14th Street</span>, call it anything you want, but the main business section. </sentence><sentence id="133">They drove up with <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">Asked no questions. </sentence><sentence id="135">Broke in the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, emptied everything and took it away. </sentence><sentence id="136">But they left a receipt with an address where to come for payment, but the way the whole thing was done was already scary besides we knew what's going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">Q. When was this?A. "39, immediately. </sentence><sentence id="138">Q. In September, right away?A. A week, two weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="139">Immediately. </sentence><sentence id="140">So, again, my father turned to me. </sentence><sentence id="141">Who would go? </sentence><sentence id="142">As I told you before my father was 01:14:)) Jewishly dressed. </sentence><sentence id="143">Had the beard and pyes, like a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="144">Naturally, he wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="145">He wouldn't send boys because we figured boys is This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection more dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="148">But we still underestimated -- rather overestimated the German character figuring that if a woman will go, they wouldn't beat them or do anything wrong to a woman. </sentence><sentence id="149">Men, it's more dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="150">So, it was decided that mother went. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was already curfew. </sentence><sentence id="152">5:00 was curfew. </sentence><sentence id="153">Mother went with this receipt to the place where they were told to come, and curfew time came closer and mother didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="154">She's not here. </sentence><sentence id="155">You know we're in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="156">We realized we're in trouble and started being very, very nervous about it, and again come close to curfew, Father chose me and says go there. </sentence><sentence id="157">We knew the address where she went. </sentence><sentence id="158">See where Mother is. </sentence><sentence id="159">There's not question that you went. </sentence><sentence id="160">I went there. </sentence><sentence id="161">We still didn't know the score that it was dangerous even to make a step on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">I went there, into the animal's mouth, you know, into an <span class="building">office</span> where my mother was already in <span class="populated place">jaihl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">I came there it was already dark. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was getting dark. </sentence><sentence id="165">So, the lights were on in these <span class="building">offices</span>, and I just started walking around. </sentence><sentence id="166">I could have been squeezed to death or shot to death or killed or taken right away. </sentence><sentence id="167">They didn't probably realize who Iam immediately. </sentence><sentence id="168">I didn't see mother. </sentence><sentence id="169">Now, imagine that I came back without mother, because curfew was over, I was still able to take a <span class="spatial object">tram</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">Still able to grab on and get <span class="building">home</span> a little past curfew. </sentence><sentence id="171">We didn't know that you could have gotten killed for being out on curfew, but I come without Mother. </sentence><sentence id="172">We never seen her. </sentence><sentence id="173">That's when we escaped to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">After a few days or weeks, I don't remember exactly, Father decided because <span class="populated place">Litzmannstadt</span>, <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> was turned into the name <span class="populated place">Litzmannstadt</span> and it was getting terrorized. </sentence><sentence id="175">The <span class="populated place">city</span> was getting terrorized more and more every minute and we realized that being that they already have mother in, they'll lead to us. </sentence><sentence id="176">Meaning, mainly we talk of Father. </sentence><sentence id="177">The decision was that my father and his sons, all of my brothers, and my sister and her baby are escaping to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, which was only supposed to be only <span class="region">occupied territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">Not incorporated in the <span class="country">Reich</span>, not the <span class="region">Holy Land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">Q.

Posters?A. Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="188">That it is not true the rumors that you're hearing about the atrocities about the German Army and the Germans is not true. </sentence><sentence id="189">Come out when you see the German Army when they come marching in, and greet them. </sentence><sentence id="190">You hear that? </sentence><sentence id="191">And everything was going fine and smooth. </sentence><sentence id="192">We have seen an Army that we didn't even imagine exists because the Polish Army was a thousand years behind with little horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">Here at once you see a motorized, not one horse, everything in <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">We went out in the main <span class="dlf">street</span> and nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="195">That lasted only a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="196">Then they started grabbing Jews and burying them in the <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="198">Q. They shot the Jews?A. No, they didn't need to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="199">If he wanted, he could shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="200">They didn't make a big tsimmes, a big deal about how you died. </sentence><sentence id="201">They wanted you to die the most miserable way. </sentence><sentence id="202">So, throwing you into a <span class="building">mass shelter</span> like that and covering you up, to them that was a very befitting way to doing it to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="203">Anyway, we decided to escape to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">Escaping to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">How do you escape to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>? </sentence><sentence id="206">Do you buy a ticket on the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> or on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">Do you take your <span class="spatial object">car</span> from the <span class="building">garage</span>? </sentence><sentence id="208">There was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="209">Number one, we were immediately forbidden to use <span class="spatial object">public transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">Anyway, it was still the beginning and there was still some horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span> and imagine when I think of it now, that by horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> and the winter got tough, like in spite, very cold and a baby also with us, and we made it finally to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">It's easier said than done. </sentence><sentence id="212">So, now to describe the terror that happened in these few weeks is as  impossible as to describe the whole thing, because when you're talking about terror, is not only that something happened. </sentence><sentence id="213">Say, somebody gets killed by a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">Somebody gets killed by a <span class="spatial object">brick</span> falling down. </sentence><sentence id="215">That's a tragedy, but that's not terror. </sentence><sentence id="216">That's why I don't call myself a survivor and I already was talking with our organization. </sentence><sentence id="217">I'm not big <span class="spatial object">mixer</span>, I don't push. </sentence><sentence id="218">We're not survivors, we are victims. </sentence><sentence id="219">Because a survivor is one who gets hurt by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="220">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="221"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection any means and then he gets revived and if the other person or realtor has any type of insurance which they do, they will be made good for. </sentence><sentence id="222">They'll take him to a <span class="building">hospital</span>, and if he's lucky he'll come back as a survived person. </sentence><sentence id="223">We are not survivers. </sentence><sentence id="224">We suffered day and night. </sentence><sentence id="225">Because why did my wife have to have a dream fifty years later that they take the children and it's cold outside and they don't have socks on. </sentence><sentence id="226">This is not one occasion. </sentence><sentence id="227">If it's a funeral, a bar mitzvah, a wedding, a card game a <span class="building">restaurant</span> and we were this week twice, that this thing does not come up amongst us. </sentence><sentence id="228">I don't know if you did realize it. </sentence><sentence id="229">This is why my neighbor Mary once said to me, "Sol, why don't you start living a normal life? </sentence><sentence id="230">Get it out of your mind." </sentence><sentence id="231">Easy said. </sentence><sentence id="232">Get it out of your mind. </sentence><sentence id="233">I wish it could. </sentence><sentence id="234">There is not a day, if more than once a day, if we go to sleep, if we go to eat, if we meet for a game, if we go for a walk, always comes up. </sentence><sentence id="235">This was -- it cannot be told. </sentence><sentence id="236">It cannot be told. </sentence><sentence id="237">As my teacher said, he cannot find expression in the <span class="spatial object">dictionaries</span> of the languages. </sentence><sentence id="238">You can see that we can go on and on forever. </sentence><sentence id="239">If you need to go <span class="building">home</span> to sleep, you will not. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, ask me questions which will lead me in, otherwise I get lost in it. </sentence><sentence id="241">Q.
