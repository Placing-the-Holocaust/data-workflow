people who I'm do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="201">And so in that sense, I didn't know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. </sentence><sentence id="202">It was very interesting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="203">So, as I was saying, it was a spider

id="223">And that's where he was, in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">So when I got their letter, I wrote. </sentence><sentence id="225">And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free <span class="building">University of Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">I think it's in <span class="populated place">Dallem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">It's in <span class="populated place">Dallem</span> or wherever it is. </sentence><sentence id="228">It's in -- near <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> -- in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">And so h-he decided he was going to go via <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and -- to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, from -- from the in -- from <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">So he came by

will come, I can't come right away." </sentence><sentence id="236">So I postponed and postponed. </sentence><sentence id="237">Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and say, "Come, come, come." </sentence><sentence id="238">And he sent me an affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="239">And I got a call from the <span class="building">American embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Rotterdam</span> and they were saying, "Well, do you want to come, or don't you want to come? </sentence><sentence id="240">You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what's going on there?" </sentence><sentence id="241">And so I took a deep breath and I went. </sentence><sentence
