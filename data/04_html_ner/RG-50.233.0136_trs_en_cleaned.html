<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: So it was more religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to <span class="country">Palestine</span> after finishing this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span> in 1966, 1967 I think and I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out that there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in <span class="country">Israel</span> except me, so they made it. </sentence><sentence id="5">They joked around and they said " Topas remained the only Zionist among us". </sentence><sentence id="6">Because I was living in <span class="country">America</span> and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them achieved a very high rank in the army. </sentence><sentence id="7">And only one of the fellows that graduated the <span class="building">farming school</span> remained a farmer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Did you dream of going to <span class="country">Palestine</span> during that year you were at the <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="16">I had my <span class="dlf">sites</span> set for <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">It was something very attractive to us, to be in a <span class="region">land</span> that historically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous history of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in <span class="country">Poland</span>, in most of the <span class="country">countries</span> of the world in general, then <span class="country">Palestine</span> loomed very largely in our consideration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular <span class="building">school</span>, do you recall what it was like to be Jewish and to go to <span class="building">public schools</span> for higher education at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in <span class="building">public school</span> for a very brief period, one year that my mother sent me to <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">I don't remember the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="25">But other than that, I was always going, for instance, the <span class="building">primary school</span> that I went to, the <span class="building">prep school</span> so to speak was a <span class="building">Hebrew academy</span>, one of the most modern of it's kind and had a religious orientation. </sentence><sentence id="26">Modern. </sentence><sentence id="27">Then I went to <span class="building">gymnasium</span> henu which the Hebrew word denotes upbringing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="28">Then I went to this <span class="building">Tarbot School</span> and I think the reason they sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. </sentence><sentence id="38">To that extent that my grandparents were assimilated on my father's side, not my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="39">But since the grandparents on my mother's side lived in a distance away from us in <span class="populated place">Forst</span> we didn't have much contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="40">But in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, we virtually lived with our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="41">We were living in the same <span class="building">apartment building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe the Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our <span class="building">stores</span> were open on Saturday; although holidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn't interfere with business. </sentence><sentence id="43">And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and he sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="44">So in 1920 during the Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the truth about his age. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">But as he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit of difference to the anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="47">All the Jews are the same. </sentence><sentence id="48">So he was a thinking individual. </sentence><sentence id="49">One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to <span class="building">courts</span> and listening to trials because he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality, questions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. </sentence><sentence id="50">So eventually, eventually, he became aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt it was a bankrupt. </sentence><sentence id="53">Although many people at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. </sentence><sentence id="54">So at time already when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. </sentence><sentence id="77">And our <span class="building">house</span> became kosher and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="78">Because in my childhood we had a <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span> and we were well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so clean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a prayer in German. </sentence><sentence id="79">This was in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">But this radically has changed. </sentence><sentence id="81">For my father became religious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and our bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not only to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you notice this when you were seven? </sentence><sentence id="89">This must have come as a major change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: It was a major change. </sentence><sentence id="93">In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware that Iam a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="94">Because I was sheltered you know in my life in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and in <span class="building">schools</span> and I was not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti- Semitism nor did I understand what it really meant. </sentence><sentence id="95">We lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> so I was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="96">That's the way I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="97">But one time when we were in our <span class="country">country</span> in the summer, I might have been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and he told me to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="98">I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and that we were enslaved in <span class="country">Egypt</span> because this is the core of our belief and of the historical, factual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of <span class="country">Egypt</span> to become a free people., </sentence><sentence id="99">to become a people to be a light to the <span class="country">nations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">He said a few things that were just beyond me perhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the <span class="building">school</span> I was going to and I was sent to a more religious oriented <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my father's change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very <span class="building">religious household</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: You are very observant. </sentence><sentence id="115">That is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="116">When I gave you the names, | told you that my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of giving Polish names and my brother's name was given originally in <span class="populated place">Stanislav</span> although his Hebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef for Joseph Benjamin. </sentence><sentence id="117">But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my father's orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my grandfather's father. </sentence><sentence id="118">He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Would you describe your father as a strict father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. </sentence><sentence id="127">Although he could have been quite relaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. </sentence><sentence id="128">He believed that the key word we have to focus our attention is righteousness. </sentence><sentence id="129">To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be moral, to be truthful. </sentence><sentence id="130">He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability to comprehend that. </sentence><sentence id="131">That this is significant. </sentence><sentence id="132">Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own style and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How would you describe your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: My mother came from a <span class="building">religious home</span> but she was somewhat of a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="148">Perhaps not consciously so but it was simply a question of economics. </sentence><sentence id="149">She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the <span class="building">household</span>, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram, was a hat maker. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. </sentence><sentence id="151">When he was not working he was spending his time in a <span class="building">house of study</span>, in a <span class="building">religious house of study</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn't see future in following this tradition. </sentence><sentence id="153">Because they didn't have big dowries. </sentence><sentence id="154">At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to anybody who was worth his weight in salt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. </sentence><sentence id="166">Three of the four daughters went into the professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence. </sentence><sentence id="167">There was just no future for them in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Excuse me, in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">It is still a <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is now even more significant. </sentence><sentence id="171">I guess <span class="country">Poland</span> calls it the <span class="populated place">capital</span> of petro chemicals in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I revisited the <span class="populated place">town</span> when I was there in 1989 and I found the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where my grandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. </sentence><sentence id="173">Now, this, in the <span class="country">United States</span> would be way below poverty level because the whole <span class="interior space">apartment</span> consisted of one <span class="interior space">room</span> and a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and six people lived there. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is just hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I remember visiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always immaculately clean. </sentence><sentence id="176">Everything was so perfect -- they didn't have running water. </sentence><sentence id="177">They didn't have a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, no plumbing there. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="179">My father already became religious at that time because before, we didn't go there. </sentence><sentence id="180">And it was contrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> with <span class="interior space">floors</span> that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma's <span class="building">home</span> and plumbing and a <span class="spatial object">bidet</span> in the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living. </sentence><sentence id="181">Whereas in <span class="populated place">Proust</span>, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally. </sentence><sentence id="182">So my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support herself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the biological process. </sentence><sentence id="183">Her older sister Franya, you" ll find out in my book, they're in <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, you" ll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she herself was a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="184">My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well- to-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you know a public accountant. </sentence><sentence id="185">I don't know if she was certified, if such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: A notary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="210">And the youngest one was with the family. </sentence><sentence id="211">I don't think she went in to a profession; she remained at <span class="building">home</span> and never married. </sentence><sentence id="212">They all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war. </sentence><sentence id="213">The youngest daughter's name was Razel. </sentence><sentence id="214">So this was the background. </sentence><sentence id="215">When my mother came to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, she in the <span class="building">university</span> in the <span class="building">school of law</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">In other words, you must  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection application here the document that I obtained from the <span class="building">archives</span>, she says on her basis of her entry examination she was admitted to the state's <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">She covered a course of 8+ course in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. </sentence><sentence id="218">And then she was admitted to <span class="building">University of Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">Before, they had this clause about <span class="spatial object">bench</span> clause and father restrictions but there were still restrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. </sentence><sentence id="220">And she had two handicaps -- being Jewish and being a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: And being from a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, by <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> standards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: By <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> standards. </sentence><sentence id="237">So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the Topas boys. </sentence><sentence id="238">So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother which was my uncle Ben. </sentence><sentence id="239">And this is how people fell in love with the tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="246"> A; Well, the results were predictable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Your father was smitten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: He must have been. </sentence><sentence id="251">And he married very young. </sentence><sentence id="252">My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 when they married. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this matter? </sentence><sentence id="257">It must have not been the planned marriage of their dreams. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Indeed, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="261">As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because in Europe it was not like in the <span class="country">United States</span> where you have misalliances between rich and poor and between professional and non-professional. </sentence><sentence id="262">There was a class-consciousness, even among Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry someone from a very poor family by contrast. </sentence><sentence id="263">And my grandparents were opposing too on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some obscure <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> and they didn't like the idea that my mother was older than he. </sentence><sentence id="264">Four years older. </sentence><sentence id="265">They didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="266">But apparently they were overruled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: By your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Probably by my father. </sentence><sentence id="277">He wanted to have his way. </sentence><sentence id="278">My mother was never very happy living in such close proximity to my father's family because she realized the objection and she realized she was married over these objections. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="283">How about your father's brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: My father's brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which was the second in <span class="dlf">line</span> was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing photographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn't get married until probably maybe a year or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the job of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, <span class="building">Topaz Shoe Company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I have very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="288">Bachelors have money. </sentence><sentence id="289">Married people have This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="290">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="291"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection responsibilities and bills. </sentence><sentence id="292">And he lived with the grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="293">So my brother Szymon and I and my cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father's sister Bella Necovyak who lived with them there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping in his <span class="interior space">room</span> from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to wake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the matinee to go and see the movie. </sentence><sentence id="294">And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the choices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. </sentence><sentence id="295">And he knew to buy his peace he had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the <span class="spatial object">streetcars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">Sometimes he would say, "It's such a beautiful day, why don't you go to the <span class="dlf">park</span>?" " </sentence><sentence id="297">Why do you always have to go to the movie?" </sentence><sentence id="298">That is one of my fond memories that he was very generous that way. </sentence><sentence id="299">I also remember that he bought me my first <span class="spatial object">two -wheeler</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">My parents probably couldn't afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: And kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: And kids. </sentence><sentence id="321">That means the same. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Now I remember that your brother, from your description, he had to have been a hell of a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="325">I don't know whether he was a great student. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Who is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Your uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: <span class="populated place">Neteck</span>? </sentence><sentence id="333">I don't think that he distinguished himself particularly. </sentence><sentence id="334">He graduated <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">He might have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="336">But the one who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. </sentence><sentence id="337">He was distinguished in many sports too, that's why we remember him. </sentence><sentence id="338">The newspaper clippings would tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called <span class="building">Hapoyal</span> which was one of the first line teams in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was a Jewish team. </sentence><sentence id="340">Hapoyal means the worker. </sentence><sentence id="341">That didn't sit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur an injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood infection. </sentence><sentence id="342">But I remember that when he graduated <span class="building">high school</span> and I was still then very young, he didn't want to go or perhaps he couldn't get admission although he was a very good student, to the <span class="building">University of Warsaw</span> and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. </sentence><sentence id="343">So he went to the <span class="building">Polytechnic</span> in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and became an excellent chemist in his field. </sentence><sentence id="344">He survived the war and when he came to <span class="country">America</span> he couldn't get any employment. </sentence><sentence id="345">But eventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with <span class="building">Merck Pharmaceuticals</span> when he distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became a director of research and went to <span class="building">Marshall Rectify</span> in <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span> and he told me one time that the <span class="spatial object">rectifier</span> that weighs about a ton made by <span class="building">General Electric</span> was made by him that weighs as much as a book of matches. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: We were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="361">You were saying that he went to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> to study. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: In the <span class="building">German Polytechnic</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="365">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="366">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="367"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: In the 1930's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: In the 1930's, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Just before the Nazis came to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="378"> \ </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: He graduated before the <span class="region">Sudenland</span>, before the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="380">He must have graduated around circa 1937. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: What was he planning to do? </sentence><sentence id="384">When he finished graduating, what would he have done in <span class="country">Poland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="963">Q: I was trying to imagine when we were talking about the affidavits earlier, the reasons why he wouldn't pursue that and I thought to myself, well perhaps he didn't want to call attention to himself, especially since other people were being arrested. </sentence><sentence id="964">---presenting yourselves to the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so. </sentence><sentence id="968">That anyone, this was probably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and showed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for <span class="country">America</span>, the Germans could let them go, they could tell them to go <span class="building">home</span>, or they could put them in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="969">We knew in <span class="populated place">Poviac</span> which was the most wholesome <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> that they had some Jewish families that had American --. </sentence><sentence id="970">We didn't even want to let them know that we had American relationships although the packages would have indicated this. </sentence><sentence id="971">But they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="972"><span class="spatial object">Food packages</span> is this kind of thing, that it doesn't have any political significance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: But it's curious that the Germans were consciously trying to starve the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and yet they allowed the food packages to come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="982">Because it was a drop in the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="983">Maybe they would feel differently if it was a real organized Jewish effort in <span class="country">America</span> to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the people in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="984">Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="985">In fact, my grandmother's sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in <span class="country">America</span>, there was a limit on what she could take. </sentence><sentence id="986">She couldn't take currency, just a few hundred dollars, from <span class="country">Poland</span> when she came over to visit. </sentence><sentence id="987">But she had some jewelry and she was using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages. </sentence><sentence id="988">But that was not enough and she had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a paralyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us these packages. </sentence><sentence id="989">She is a big heroine in our family. </sentence><sentence id="990">She did this and her sister, I found out when I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name she was called by. </sentence><sentence id="991">What are you doing? </sentence><sentence id="992">What are you knocking yourself out? </sentence><sentence id="993">They are not going to get these packages. </sentence><sentence id="994">The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages. </sentence><sentence id="995">Therefore you are doing it in vain. </sentence><sentence id="996">My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument because it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if she listened to her, we would have perished sooner. </sentence><sentence id="997">I probably wouldn't get the point where I can start my <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> career. </sentence></p></dialogue>
