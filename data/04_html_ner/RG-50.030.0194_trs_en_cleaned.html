but my father always wanted to be a businessman, and he wanted to get out of <span class="populated place">Lambsheim</span> to go into the big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">So what, about a couple...And my mother was a businesswoman also. </sentence><sentence id="9">In fact, that's how they met--while in business. </sentence><sentence id="10">And they were working together, and that's how they met. </sentence><sentence id="11">And we moved to <span class="populated place">Lambsheim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">No. </sentence><sentence id="13">We moved to <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span>, a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was about a couple of years old. </sentence><sentence id="15">And we were there. </sentence><sentence id="16">I started to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">I started first grade there. </sentence><sentence id="18">And uh soon after that the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="19">And my father was sent to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, first, while we were still at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">And my mother and I-- I was the only child that my parents had--my mother and I, and my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="21">And they closed my father's business, and no one could touch it, handle it. </sentence><sentence id="22">Was padlocked. </sentence><sentence id="23">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="24">And my father came back from <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, and he was <span class="building">home</span> for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="25">And then uh...we had to wear armbands that said "Jude"--Jew--on it. </sentence><sentence id="26">We all had to wear armbands. </sentence><sentence id="27">And uh...children stopped playing with me. </sentence><sentence id="28">And they would call us names. </sentence><sentence id="29">And then one day, a big <span class="spatial object">guard truck</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh, the <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">Many of them--5, 6 with the <span class="spatial object">pistols</span> out. </sentence><sentence id="32">And they came and told us that they were picking us up and taking us to <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">We were not allowed to take anything with us. </sentence><sentence id="34">As we were. </sentence><sentence id="35">I remember them tearing our <span class="building">house</span> apart. </sentence><sentence id="36">I remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="37">I was only 6 years. </sentence><sentence id="38">But two of them just pulled one of the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> apart. </sentence><sentence id="39">They...they just demolished the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">And then they put a lock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, after we left. </sentence><sentence id="41">And uh...we were all piled into the big <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, like an <span class="spatial object">Army truck</span>; and we sit on the wooden <span class="spatial object">benches</span> in the <span class="spatial object">Army trucks</span>, and they made different stops. </sentence><sentence id="42">They picked up different families until the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was full. </sentence><sentence id="43">And then when the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was full, we were driven to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44"><span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was the first <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> that we were there." </sentence><sentence id="45">There we were all uh together. </sentence><sentence id="46">Uh, men and women, children in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">They kept the families together. </sentence><sentence id="48">Uh, <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was a very dirty place--uh, muddy, rainy. </sentence><sentence id="49">I remember walking in <span class="env feature">mud</span> all the time. </sentence><sentence id="50">Uh, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="51">We...we slept in <span class="building">barracks</span> on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, on...on uh <span class="dlf">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">We slept on <span class="env feature">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">And I remember getting very ill. </sentence><sentence id="54">1 became very sick. </sentence><sentence id="55">And I had a terrible, terrible ear ache and a high fever. </sentence><sentence id="56">And my mother tried everything. </sentence><sentence id="57">She couldn't break my fever. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they took me to the <span class="building">infirmary</span> on the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">And uh... remember only because they put me in a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">I wasn't lying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="61">I was actually in the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">And I was then later told that I had mastoid, which is a very bad ear infection that goes with the ear drums and that caused a lot of my hearing loss that I have now caused by that. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I don't remember, but I was told... My father told me later on that they told him I would not live through the night. </sentence><sentence id="64">And they told him to go out and build a <span class="spatial object">casket</span> for me. </sentence><sentence id="65">And he refused to do it. </sentence><sentence id="66">And he stayed there, and my mother was there; and I remember being wrapped in cold towels and cold...white sheets, cold white sheets. </sentence><sentence id="67">And the fever broke through that night. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I survived. </sentence><sentence id="69">Obviously, it was not meant to be. </sentence><sentence id="70">And I did  get better. </sentence><sentence id="71">But my hearing was impaired from then on. </sentence><sentence id="72">And uh...the men worked. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I remember my father had to go out to work, but...uh we were surrounded by <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and by soldiers with...with pistols and guns. </sentence><sentence id="74">And uh...very little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="75">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="76">And then one day, they came and put us back in the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>; and were told we were going to another <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span> near [NB: in] <span class="country">France</span> by the <span class="dlf">border</span>, <span class="dlf">French border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">That was completely opposite of <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">It was hilly and stones and dry. </sentence><sentence id="79">I remember falling many times, hurting my knee. </sentence><sentence id="80">And uh...I was a child. </sentence><sentence id="81">Six, seven years old, and running around and everything. </sentence><sentence id="82">And what comes to mind now in <span class="populated place">Rivesaltes</span>, there was a lot of Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="83">And Gypsies were also put in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">They were prosecuted just like the Jews were. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I was very interested and I was always told never to go to the <span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">Of course, the more I was told not to go... And one day I went. </sentence><sentence id="87">And what the Gypsies did, they kept the children and they would sell them--literally, sell children. </sentence><sentence id="88">Well, I was missing. </sentence><sentence id="89">And my parents were going absolutely crazy looking for me; but my father knew exactly where I was. </sentence><sentence id="90">And he went to the <span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span>, and I was there and he took me back. </sentence><sentence id="91">I remember that very well. </sentence><sentence id="92">And there, the men and women were separated. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was with my grandparents and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="94">The young men were in a different...uh <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">They had to work. </sentence><sentence id="96">And the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> were outside and everything; and we had to stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="97">I don't remember too much more about that. </sentence><sentence id="98">Uh, I do remember people talking always about what lay ahead and what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="99">And uh...then one day...uh my father approached me. </sentence><sentence id="100">And my parents...and they told me that...I remember my father saying to me that he doesn't know what lays ahead and what will become of us, but he would like me to go with some nice people. </sentence><sentence id="101">And it turned out to be the <span class="building">French Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">And uh... also think that a lot of people were against my parents. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was like giving their child away. </sentence><sentence id="104">But they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="105">They thought that was best for me. </sentence><sentence id="106">Uh, they thought that if they could save me or do whatever, they would do anything. </sentence><sentence id="107">So uh they took us away. </sentence><sentence id="108">The last... don't remember saying good bye to my father; but I do have a picture of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="109">I...the last time I saw my mother was behind <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">I was on one side, she was on the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">And we said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="112">And that["s] the last I heard or seen of her. </sentence><sentence id="113">That was my last picture of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="114">And many years later, I found out that a few days after I left with by ten other children to get to <span class="country">France</span> that all that <span class="spatial object">transport</span> went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">The reason that my father did not get to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> is that he was young. </sentence><sentence id="116">And halfway to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>... He told me that later, since he survived, too--that half way to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they stopped the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and they asked...all the young men had to leave the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">And women and children and old men had to stay in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">So my father had to leave my parents... leave my mother and grandparents, and leave the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">And he said...then he saw a big sign to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and he saw the <span class="spatial object">train</span> leave. </sentence><sentence id="120">And that's the last he seen or heard of his family. </sentence><sentence id="121">And uh...then uh...he was in several <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, which he told me after, which I don't remember the names. </sentence><sentence id="122">Uh, I was taken with the other children to a <span class="building">children's home</span> in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">And we were there for a short time. </sentence><sentence id="124">Not very long. </sentence><sentence id="125">I remember bombs falling, and the sirens always, and running into <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And I can remember we would be running to the <span class="building">shelter</span> on one side, and <span class="building">buildings</span> falling on the other side with bombs. </sentence><sentence id="127">And the <span class="building">children's home</span> was hit and was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="128">And so we had to be separated. </sentence><sentence id="129">And the best thing was to take us to a <span class="building">convent</span> in southern... It was in the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And everyone knows that the...the French, the Southern French were wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="131">They were always helping Jewish  people, displaced people. </sentence><sentence id="132">They were always helping them. </sentence><sentence id="133">And the nuns were just...just wonderful to us children. </sentence><sentence id="134">And uh...we were so young, it was almost fun for us. </sentence><sentence id="135">Here was a <span class="building">convent</span> full of nuns, no men. </sentence><sentence id="136">Uh, one nun was a shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="137">One was a cook. </sentence><sentence id="138">One...
