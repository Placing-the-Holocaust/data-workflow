<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: But let's just go back a little bit before that. </sentence><sentence id="128">You had mentioned that there were children beating you up when you were a young boy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Was this because you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: And what next signs did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: The reaction was exciting because we didn't know about war. </sentence><sentence id="228">And matter of fact, the feeling of war existed prior to start of the war, like being in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>*; we had a big place where we played in <span class="env feature">sand</span>, building <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, building <span class="spatial object">boats</span>, building different things. </sentence><sentence id="229">That summer we told everybody not to play, we are going to play war, like we made Polish Army and German Army. </sentence><sentence id="230">Me and other boy, we had a Polish army, and there was another boy by the name Mojzesz was the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was called Froim in the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, I was also called Malydeg Icek. </sentence><sentence id="232">Icek is my brother, I'm the small <span class="building">Icek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">So there was the army of Moses and the Army of Ariel and Froim -- Ariel was the second general. </sentence><sentence id="234">And we prepared <span class="building">bunkers</span> and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="235">And for bullets we would save chestnuts, and when the war broke out, we start throwing chestnuts. </sentence><sentence id="236">When we got hit three times, had to be carried out, so that was the feeling that naturally <span class="country">Poland</span> lost, and <span class="country">Germany</span> won. </sentence><sentence id="237">So then after the war -- when the war started, naturally our <span class="building">building</span> was one of the first to get burned down because they had announced that <span class="building">Solna number eight</span>, where we have a <span class="interior space">room</span>, is a point of refreshments for soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="238">A little bit later a bomb came down; an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> was just cruising about, and they couldn't stop the fire or anything, and the <span class="building">building</span> went down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Where were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Not terrified; kind of excited. </sentence><sentence id="273">Because the notion was that Jewish people and the German were getting along because, basically more or less understood the language, could communicate more or less. </sentence><sentence id="274">So we believed it wouldn't be too bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: So you didn't have much information in terms of what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Not at all, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="281">Not interested, only to satisfy them, our hunger, because when the war broke out, right away everything was -- all the <span class="building">stores</span> were closed. </sentence><sentence id="282">There was no food available. </sentence><sentence id="283">And even in the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, you know, it became rations like, you know. </sentence><sentence id="284">Food was available; Dr. Korczak saw to it that we get food, but -- it appeared on the <span class="spatial object">blackboard</span>: Two slices of bread, or three slices of bread; as much as we can. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I will never forget, Dr. Korczak used to stand over us in good times. </sentence><sentence id="286">I remember good times and I remember bad times. </sentence><sentence id="287">In the good times he used to go behind the children and make sure they eat. </sentence><sentence id="288">And as a joke, if somebody was holding a piece of bread, he used to pull it out, grab it and put it in his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="289">Now I also remember when it appeared two slices each, also for Dr. Korczak two slices, but he never ate his two slices, he gave to another child. </sentence><sentence id="290">Every day he gave his bread to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="291">And we stupid children, we took it. </sentence><sentence id="292">We never realize that the man grows thinner and thinner and thinner; that kind of man he was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
