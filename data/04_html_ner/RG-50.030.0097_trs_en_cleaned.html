<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Ivo, would you tell us your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: <span class="building">Ivo Herzer</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Uh, I was born <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, on February 5, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="12">What is, tell us something about <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> and what it was like to grow up there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> is the capital of <span class="country">Croatia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">It is one of the six republics in today's <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, it had a population, Jewish population of 10,000 out of 200,000. </sentence><sentence id="18">Uh, and uh, it was uh, it's a <span class="populated place">city</span> that resembles <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> to some extent in its atmosphere because it was in the <span class="region">Austro- Hungarian part</span> for so many centuries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Tell me about, what was it like for you. </sentence><sentence id="24">How, where did your family live, in what part, and was it a <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>? </sentence><sentence id="25">What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: There was no <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was no <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">There had never been any <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="35">The Jews lived, uh, all over. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, we lived <span class="populated place">downtown</span> in my grandfather's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">My parents were born in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> already, but not my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="38">The Jews of <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> were strongly Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="39">And as far as the religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="40">We were Ashkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of <span class="region">eastern Yugoslavia</span>--in <span class="country">Serbia</span>, in Bosnia[- Hercegovina], in <span class="country">Montenegro</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">The total <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> before the war was about 70,000. </sentence><sentence id="42">As I said, with very strong ties to <span class="region">Eretz Israel</span> at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: What about your family? </sentence><sentence id="54">Who made up your, your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I have no brothers or sisters. </sentence><sentence id="58">And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="59">So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an <span class="building">insurance company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">We were middle-class, comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="61">There were no signs of overt antisemitism there. </sentence><sentence id="62">There was antisemitism but it was kept more or less under the surface; and especially in the main part of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>--in <span class="country">Serbia</span>--there was no anti-semitism, because the Jews embraced the idea of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> rather than separate nations. </sentence><sentence id="63">And so there was no government-sponsored antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="64">However, a Jew could not become a professor in the <span class="building">university</span>, or get a government position or a high government position. </sentence><sentence id="65">This was  understood. </sentence><sentence id="66">Unless you're baptized himself or herself. </sentence><sentence id="67">But otherwise, we were left alone. </sentence><sentence id="68">There was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="69">It was quite a comfortable life for the middle-class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: What kind of a schooling did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I went to the <span class="building">Jewish elementary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">We had in those days four years of elementary education which was sectarian. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I went to the <span class="building">Jewish elementary school</span> and then it was followed by eight years of <span class="building">high school</span>, of <span class="building">European high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">I only finished six, because the war came. </sentence><sentence id="89">The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or sixth grade. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What was that <span class="building">high school</span> like? </sentence><sentence id="96">This was a <span class="building">secular high school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: This was a secular <span class="building">high school</span>, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields of science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin. </sentence><sentence id="100">There was Latin, French and German were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian. </sentence><sentence id="101">Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="102">So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was typical European, the <span class="building">educational system</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Did you enjoy it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes, I... enjoyed it; because I...I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="115">But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">Most of the population did not participate in this type of <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">Uh, there was a high rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> of those days. </sentence><sentence id="118">So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="127">Did you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our <span class="building">religion class</span>, to another <span class="building">classroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">He would say something. " </sentence><sentence id="130">Here come the chosen people." </sentence><sentence id="131">It was sort of sarcastic, but it was...it was that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="132">Or, uh, if, uh, in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> sometimes children would shout, "Jew, go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="133">But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh, incident. </sentence><sentence id="134">However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was a <span class="building">political party</span>, <span class="interior space">underground</span>, a fascist party which was antisemitic. </sentence><sentence id="136">And they did write graffiti and publish slogans, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="137">And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists, who didn't want <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> at all. </sentence><sentence id="138">They wanted independent <span class="country">Croatia</span>, Catholic Croatia; and they were fiercely antisemitic. </sentence><sentence id="139">But they lived mostly in exile. </sentence><sentence id="140">In the inter-war years, they lived in <span class="country">Italy</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span>--which countries gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it happened, they could bring them back into <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> and install them in this Croatian state,  which would then be a satellite of the Axis powers. </sentence><sentence id="141">So there was always the <span class="interior space">underground</span>; and it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom. </sentence><sentence id="142">But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as much as it might have been in other <span class="region">parts of Europe</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: What happened when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: When the war broke out in 1939, <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> was neutral. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh, in 1940 <span class="country">Italy</span> attacked <span class="country">Greece</span>, and could not achieve a victory there. </sentence><sentence id="162"><span class="country">Germany</span> wanted <span class="country">Greece</span> out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="163">In fact, <span class="country">Germany</span> wanted the <span class="region">Balkans</span> secured; because <span class="country">Germany</span> planned to attack the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops go through <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, so that they can then attack <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">The Yugoslav government agreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government. </sentence><sentence id="166">This was in <span class="country">Serbia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">An anti- Fascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti- German. </sentence><sentence id="168">It was in defiance, direct defiance of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="169">And in response to that, in April 1941, he ordered that <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="170"><span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Italy</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span> and <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> all attacked <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, and defeated its army in about fourteen days. </sentence><sentence id="171">And that Croatian state was then established under the name the "Independent State of <span class="country">Croatia</span>." </sentence><sentence id="172">And the exiled nationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that state. </sentence><sentence id="173">They called themselves "<span class="building">UstaSa</span>." </sentence><sentence id="174">That means, uh, "Men of the Uprising." </sentence><sentence id="175">And immediately, within the first week, they began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation. </sentence><sentence id="176">Not only Jews, but also the Serbs. </sentence><sentence id="177">Orthodox Serbs were really on their list of destruction. </sentence><sentence id="178">And Gypsies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: The legislation was sweeping. </sentence><sentence id="201">The Jews, there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="202">The Jews had to wear a yellow, uh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for "Jew" in <span class="country">Yugoslav</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of <span class="building">apartments</span> in a certain section of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">They had to surrender <span class="spatial object">cameras</span>, <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="205">It was a preliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish population into numbness. </sentence><sentence id="206">Because it was very sudden. </sentence><sentence id="207">Almost upon arrival of these...of the <span class="building">UstaSa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed them as being Communists. </sentence><sentence id="209">And they began some deportations. </sentence><sentence id="210">There...those were times, they were somewhat chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, it was a new <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">There was chaos. </sentence><sentence id="213">The <span class="building">UstaSa</span> were not that organized. </sentence><sentence id="214">There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic struggle, for the control of that state. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the Germans won that control. </sentence><sentence id="216">The Italians, who had banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">In other words, it is important to understand that after the victory over <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, the Axis powers dismembered <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">There was no more <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> as a state. </sentence><sentence id="219">There was the Independent State of <span class="country">Croatia</span>; <span class="country">Serbia</span> was occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>; <span class="region">western Yugoslavia</span>--that is, <span class="country">Slovenia</span>--was divided between the Germans and Italians. </sentence><sentence id="220">And most important, for my story, the Italians occupied that <span class="region">Adriatic coast</span> of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> and most of the <span class="env feature">islands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">They also annexed part of that <span class="region">coast</span>--the best part, the richest for tourism--<span class="region">Dalmatia</span>, and made it part of <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">So that was the situation. </sentence><sentence id="223">The Jews in <span class="country">Croatia</span> [were] being slowly herded together, and taken to various <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen <span class="populated place">camps</span>  operating in <span class="country">Croatia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">The Germans were not in these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">This was all...they were all run by the <span class="building">UstaSa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these <span class="populated place">camps</span> was such that even the Germans were horrified. </sentence><sentence id="228">In their internal memoranda, they called it the "Balkan bestiality." </sentence><sentence id="229">At one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was being formed. </sentence><sentence id="230">In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an <span class="env feature">island</span> where they all perished. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was arrested on a certain day. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I was then sixteen at the time. </sentence><sentence id="233">The agent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="234">This was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="235">And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="236">He wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that "You probably mean me, and not my son." </sentence><sentence id="237">The detective insisted, "No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him." </sentence><sentence id="238">So my father said, "Well, I'll come with you." </sentence><sentence id="239">Of course, he couldn't go into that transitory <span class="populated place">camp</span>; and so I was taken there. </sentence><sentence id="240">This was on the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, where fairs were held usually. </sentence><sentence id="241">And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families, pushed against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the <span class="building">UstaSa</span>, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every hour. </sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't know at all what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="244">Now we know what happened to that <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">As I said, they were taken to the island of <span class="populated place">Pag</span>, <span class="populated place">P - A - G</span>; and they all perished there under horrible circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="246">I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call, when my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, "Are you here alone?" </sentence><sentence id="247">Since they had families. </sentence><sentence id="248">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="249">He said, "Take your things and go <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="250">Just like that. </sentence><sentence id="251">He could have easily said, "Bring his family." </sentence><sentence id="252">He didn't. </sentence><sentence id="253">Now this was past curfew time. </sentence><sentence id="254">I had no paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so I ran <span class="building">home</span>; and I wasn't...no patrol found me. </sentence><sentence id="256">I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="257">And my parents thought they had lost me already. </sentence><sentence id="258">And they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them. </sentence><sentence id="259">It was then that my parents decided that we must do something. </sentence><sentence id="260">Try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="261">But escape where? </sentence><sentence id="262">The partisans were not yet active. </sentence><sentence id="263"><span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> was surrounded by <span class="country">countries</span> that were already under German domination. </sentence><sentence id="264">How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape? </sentence><sentence id="265">And then the decision was made. </sentence><sentence id="266">Let us try to somehow escape to the <span class="region">Italian zone</span> in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">Maybe the Italians will let us in. </sentence><sentence id="268">Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because we didn't really know anything about <span class="region">Fascist Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">Since the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span> was oriented toward <span class="country">Austria</span> and the <span class="region">German-speaking Europe</span>, <span class="country">Italy</span> was the place to go for a vacation maybe. </sentence><sentence id="271">But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were concerned, was unknown to us. </sentence><sentence id="272">To us, this was a gamble. </sentence><sentence id="273">And my father obtained some sort of <span class="dlf">pass</span> which could be gotten for some money. </sentence><sentence id="274">It was just a <span class="dlf">pass</span> that said that we could be let out of <span class="country">Croatia</span>, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="275">With this pass, without the yellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by <span class="spatial object">train</span> for the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">We wanted to go actually to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Split</span>--<span class="populated place">Spalato</span>, in Italian--which then was in <span class="region">Dalmatia</span>, which then became <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">And we thought if we reached that <span class="populated place">city</span> somehow, as many Jews did, we would be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back. </sentence><sentence id="278">On the way to <span class="populated place">Spalato</span>, however, some troubles developed to the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> was turned back; and we landed in a <span class="populated place">city</span> which was the worst place to be. </sentence><sentence id="281">And this was the <span class="populated place">city</span> of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the <span class="populated place">city</span> of Gospi_--in a desolate part of the <span class="country">country</span> with curfews, patrols, and a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> for Jews just outside of <span class="populated place">Gospi_</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">We didn't know that, but there it was. </sentence><sentence id="283">The three of us,  plus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we coalesced into a small group, milling around at the <span class="building">station</span> and then trying to go into <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">It's a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">On the way, we just knocked on a <span class="dlf">door</span>--the first <span class="building">peasant house</span> we saw. </sentence><sentence id="286">Fortunately, this was a <span class="building">house</span> owned by an old Serb woman. </sentence><sentence id="287">And the Serbs were, at that time, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="288">So she understood our plight. </sentence><sentence id="289">But she was afraid of harboring us. </sentence><sentence id="290">She said she could keep us only for so many hours. </sentence><sentence id="291">We sat there. </sentence><sentence id="292">We...we stayed in the <span class="building">house</span> not knowing what to do. </sentence><sentence id="293">We couldn't go back to <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">We couldn't go forward. </sentence><sentence id="295">We had false documents. </sentence><sentence id="296">We were lost. </sentence><sentence id="297">To all intents and purposes, it seemed a completely impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="298">But again, we were lucky in that there was an <span class="building">Italian garrison</span> in that <span class="populated place">town</span>--as there were <span class="building">Italian garrisons</span> all over the <span class="region">region</span> which was not far from the <span class="env feature">sea</span>, from the <span class="env feature">coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four. </sentence><sentence id="300">I spoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his <span class="building">high school</span> days. </sentence><sentence id="301">We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help us. </sentence><sentence id="302">And we told them two words: "ebrei"--which means Jews, [and] "paura"--fear. </sentence><sentence id="303">They immediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know. </sentence><sentence id="304">And they told us to quickly go back to the <span class="building">house</span>, "calma"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="305">Their sergeant came. </sentence><sentence id="306">He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was easier to communicate. </sentence><sentence id="308">He said, "Stay here. </sentence><sentence id="309">I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into <span class="country">Italy</span>." </sentence><sentence id="310">And he left. </sentence><sentence id="311">We didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="312">We thought he just said nice things. </sentence><sentence id="313">How would he, who is he, didn't want any money. </sentence><sentence id="314">He never knew us, but he came back. </sentence><sentence id="315">He said he couldn't get a pass for us;

because my experience roughly speaking was repeated in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="568">Between four and five thousand Croatian Jews--almost all that survived--found their way to the <span class="region">Italian occupation zone</span> in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="569">Either to the <span class="region">zone</span>--we were in a <span class="region">zone</span>, not yet in <span class="country">Italy</span>--or to the annexed part of <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, which was much safer. </sentence><sentence id="570">There were no Croatians there at all. </sentence><sentence id="571">But we were safe. </sentence><sentence id="572">All came and started a very extraordinary period in my life, because we developed close relations with the Italian army. </sentence><sentence id="573">Italian officers started dating Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="574">Uh, the Italian major came to play <span class="dlf">bridge</span> with my parents and another Jewish lady. </sentence><sentence id="575">He brought me dictionaries. </sentence><sentence id="576">They brought us food. </sentence><sentence id="577">Uh, there were two things that stand out. </sentence><sentence id="578">One, that two weeks roughly I think after our arrival in <span class="populated place">Crikvenica</span> was Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="579">And, uh, somehow the Italian major--whose name was Cipolla--learned this high holiday was at hand. </sentence><sentence id="580">He called my father, and told him that he had reserved a <span class="interior space">school room</span> for the services. </sentence><sentence id="581">He abolished the curfew;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="720">Q: And they did that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="722">A: And they did that. </sentence><sentence id="723">They even used <span class="spatial object">armored cars</span>, in a fake exercise, military exercise; and they did it at first on their own and spontaneously, without informing too much their very high authorities. </sentence><sentence id="724">So that the evidence is episodic, it's in anecdotes. </sentence><sentence id="725">But it is known that so many, that today there is no question that this was... It started from the lower ranks of the Army, just as our sergeant and many other such sergeants or lieutenants. </sentence><sentence id="726">But then it became a policy. </sentence><sentence id="727">It... it received complete approval by the highest levels of the Army and the <span class="building">Italian Foreign Ministry</span>; which we, of course, did not know then. </sentence><sentence id="728">But we know today. </sentence><sentence id="729">Now, we could guess that the pressure on Italians that the Germans and Croatians exercised for our extradition was enormous. </sentence><sentence id="730">What right do they have to protect Jews who are not Italian citizens? </sentence><sentence id="731">Because we really had nothing whatsoever in common with <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="732">And they fought back diplomatically until November "42, when they felt they have to do something-- otherwise, they would have to yield to the Germans or the Croatians. </sentence><sentence id="733">They decided to put all the Jews in the <span class="region">Yugoslav zones</span> under the occupation into a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">Plus several <span class="building">hotels</span>, those <span class="region">regions</span> that were very far from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">Tell the Germans we are in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="736">Tell the Germans that a census is being taken to see if any... any one of us might have some claims to Italian citizenship, because Italian citizens were protected. </sentence><sentence id="737">Jewish are not, all the time, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="738">There were even some Italian Jews living in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and the Germans would not touch them. </sentence><sentence id="739">So the Italians used that as a pretext. </sentence><sentence id="740">This was part of a plan, of a consciously designed plan by a so-called rescue committee headed by the highest officials of the <span class="building">Italian Foreign Ministry</span>--Pietromarchi," D'Ajeta,? </sentence><sentence id="741">Ducci, several other names, all known today, in the Foreign Ministry*--decided that the Jews would not be turned over to the Germans anywhere the Italians had control of the <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="742">The Italian Army cooperated with this whole-heartedly. </sentence><sentence id="743">In November "42, the Italians arrested all of us, put us on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and we were taken to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>--still <span class="region">Croatian Yugoslav territory</span>, but under Italian flag. </sentence><sentence id="744">We didn't know again; we thought maybe this is just a <span class="interior space">stage</span> before our being turned over to the Croatians. </sentence><sentence id="745">And, unfortunately, there were two people committed suicide; and the morale was very low. </sentence><sentence id="746">And the Italian commander of...of the Second Army, which is a very high official, he came personally to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to give us a speech to reassure us that we would be  protected.

You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to doctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, "No, this is obviously not an open process. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And even if it were, so what? </sentence><sentence id="1275">I mean, the man can be put into a <span class="building">hospital</span> in under observation." </sentence><sentence id="1276">But they wouldn't let him in. </sentence><sentence id="1277">This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let as few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh, research that was done much later. </sentence><sentence id="1278">I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I came as a student. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the <span class="country">United States</span> I had to have a student visa. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't up. </sentence><sentence id="1281">To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport. </sentence><sentence id="1282">So that if you commit a crime, the <span class="country">United States</span> can send you back. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But I had no national passport. </sentence><sentence id="1284">I had to renounce my Yugoslav citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I was stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1286">How can you then get a student visa? </sentence><sentence id="1287">So again, the Italians said, "Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into <span class="country">Italy</span> if the Americans push you out." </sentence><sentence id="1288">And that should convince the Consul that he could give me the visa; which they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1323">Q: So you came here. </sentence><sentence id="1324">You went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1327">A: I went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="region">Illinois</span>; and stayed one more year to get a Master's. </sentence><sentence id="1328">I almost got it, but I  6 didn't quite get it. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And then I went to <span class="populated place">New York</span> from, uh, <span class="region">Illinois</span> and started working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1333">Q: As an engineer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: As an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the Master's, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more and more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue. </sentence><sentence id="1338">The...the Italian story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1343">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="1344">It's quite a story. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1346">The island-hopping you did in order to get to <span class="populated place">Bari</span>, from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">Bari</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Can you describe it in a little more detail? </sentence><sentence id="1348">Uh, we don't uh... Did people take out <span class="spatial object">sailboats</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1349">Did you do this at night? </sentence><sentence id="1350">How was this done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1359">A: This was mostly...mostly small <span class="spatial object">motor boats</span> and <span class="spatial object">sail boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Mostly. </sentence><sentence id="1361">It's all I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1362">There were maybe five or six <span class="env feature">islands</span>, when I was island-hopping, before the big one. </sentence><sentence id="1363">I remember, on one <span class="env feature">island</span> we were so...we were tired. </sentence><sentence id="1364">We somehow found our way to...to the local teachers--a married couple. </sentence><sentence id="1365">They gave us their <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> to use for that night. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I don't know how, because I was not involved. </sentence><sentence id="1367">It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father. </sentence><sentence id="1368">There was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And then there was another group and they came to the same <span class="env feature">island</span>, and so you have a group, so to say, travelling. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And the last big hop to the big <span class="env feature">island</span>, where the British were, there we had a big boat--70-ton <span class="spatial object">fishing boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And, uh, the <span class="env feature">sea</span> was very bad, and there were too many of us. </sentence><sentence id="1372">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="1373">What they did is, they left the older people in the hold; and us, the younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the <span class="interior space">deck</span>, so we wouldn't be washed away by the <span class="env feature">waves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And the <span class="env feature">sea</span> was mined; but the <span class="dlf">mines</span> were much deeper than this small <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, relatively small <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1375">Seventy tons is not very big. </sentence><sentence id="1376">So we were also safe that way. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh <span class="env feature">air</span>, even though there were waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the <span class="dlf">hold</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1378">But I don't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1399">Q: And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day. </sentence><sentence id="1402">There was no...that we would <span class="dlf">line</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would be paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, or some <span class="building">house</span> or <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And then, maybe, find somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Again, we have some money or clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I remember, we gave some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1407">In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of these <span class="env feature">islands</span>--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money really didn't mean much at that rate. </sentence><sentence id="1408">People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1409">But I don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1419">Q: When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to <span class="country">Egypt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1420">You were...you were... what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="1421">You were under the British control. </sentence><sentence id="1422"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1427">A: We were in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1429">Q: What was that <span class="populated place">camp</span> like? </sentence><sentence id="1430">The <span class="populated place">British camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1433">A: We were housed in <span class="building">hotels</span> and abandoned <span class="building">villas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1434">We slept on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, <span class="interior space">stone floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Uh, it was typical refugee, refugee-type situation. </sentence><sentence id="1436">You know, if you can imagine the <span class="building">Red Cross</span>... When people are evacuated--the disaster, you know, <span class="interior space">make-shift quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1437">But we were fed. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Uh, and I don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1439">It wasn't only Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1440">In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1441">Uh, we heard--but we were not told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was destined for <span class="populated place">El Saff</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1442">That was the place somewhere outside <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And I remember my father said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1444">Not one more <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1445">If we can get out of here, let's get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Somehow we will be able to live in <span class="country">Italy</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1447">Because uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible. </sentence><sentence id="1448">It will be possible to make a...to exist, rather than in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Only proved to be true. </sentence><sentence id="1450">But we had no contact with the <span class="region">outside world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going on; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I didn't know, I did not know that. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I was still a little dizzy. </sentence><sentence id="1454">I was... END OF VIDEOTAPE ... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the rescue is now becoming known. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Even though it involved few people, compared to the tremendous tragedy of the <span class="country">Jewish nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Still, there were so few positive episodes in the Holocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And I'm glad now that I see that books are coming out and articles, research is being done; that this is finally, after 40 years, becoming known. </sentence></p></dialogue>
