<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What -- what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: So most of us were really looking out for these things. </sentence><sentence id="299">When we notice in a <span class="populated place">town</span> that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out on-- you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">We would march on. </sentence><sentence id="301">We - like I said, we had this horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>, so we could move on a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="302">And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">You know, they came to <span class="country">Germany</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="304">And they were also like trying to get back. </sentence><sentence id="305">So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a -- with another man, they would just stay away from you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: So anyhow, after -- to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span>, I really don't know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="334">First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very -- from the bombs, she was a little bit more in -- and sh-she -- you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. </sentence><sentence id="335">You know, like I had a little bit of a i-injury, you know, like a shrapnel?
