</sentence><sentence id="5">Now the Nazism in certain <span class="building">schools</span> was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the <span class="building">boarding house</span> to have me transferred to a <span class="building">school</span> that was less stigmatized and coincidentally, the <span class="building">school</span> from which | had to be transferred was near the <span class="building">courthouse</span> in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place. </sentence><sentence id="6">It's, there are so many things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924, and | interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="7">And he had to get up and salute me. </sentence><sentence id="8">Also one of the many unforgettable incidences. </sentence><sentence id="9">To bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that | had gone to <span class="building">school</span>, and when | started to work for a <span class="building">company</span> in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and that was in 1930. </sentence><sentence id="10">And it was from then on that | would regularly visit my mother on weekends. </sentence><sentence id="11">This brings us to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive and particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda that was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink. </sentence><sentence id="12">And there were two elections. </sentence><sentence id="13">One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall of 1932. </sentence><sentence id="14">And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the popularity of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="15">Which ultimately then, on January 30", 1933 led to Hindenberg's decision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">It was followed up by another election, at the beginning of March of 1933. </sentence><sentence id="17">Which Hitler won only in combination with all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists. </sentence><sentence id="18">And it was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create one <span class="dlf">common front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">History would have been different, at least my belief. </sentence><sentence id="20">After the  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 election, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of <span class="country">Germany</span>, then the wave of Anti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already <span class="building">Jewish stores</span> were being pilfered or destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="21">And it ultimately led to a very important, personal incident. </sentence><sentence id="22">On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's <span class="building">house</span>, | was hardly at <span class="building">home</span>, when there was a knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and a policeman, the local gendarme, came into our <span class="interior space">living room</span> and said, "Mr. Schnaittacher, | would like to see you at the police <span class="building">station</span>." </sentence><sentence id="23">When | arrived at the <span class="building">police station</span>, he very briskly told me that | was under arrest. </sentence><sentence id="24">And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments when | had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and | had to tell her, "Mother, I'm under arrest." </sentence><sentence id="25">Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the <span class="building">police station</span> protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good. </sentence><sentence id="26">My <span class="populated place">village</span> was too small to have a <span class="building">prison</span> of it's own and so | was transported to the County seat of <span class="populated place">Earl-la-len</span> (ph) where | then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a <span class="interior space">cell</span> in the <span class="building">police prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">And | was being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there, as a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="28">Shall | continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="55">But I'm curious about a couple of things. </sentence><sentence id="56">One, was there, did you have any hint when you were taken in, why you were taken in? </sentence><sentence id="57">You were living in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> at the time that you were arrested in your <span class="populated place">hometown</span> of <span class="populated place">Forth</span>, is that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="63"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: How does that happen? </sentence><sentence id="65">Did you have any sense of why? </sentence><sentence id="66">How they would even have known of you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="68">| had no idea why | was being arrested. </sentence><sentence id="69">However, as | was turned over to the warden of the <span class="building">prison</span>, | requested information. </sentence><sentence id="70">Why | was here. </sentence><sentence id="71">And he then, either that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated that | was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist Government because of knowledge of secret <span class="building">ammunition depots</span> and liaison of illegal anti-Nazi organizations. </sentence><sentence id="72">Now, actually, yes | was an anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="73">| was no longer involved in anti-Nazi activities. </sentence><sentence id="74">So the actual reason was to provide the local populace of the <span class="populated place">village</span> with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="75">And another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">And it was quite an experience. </sentence><sentence id="77">As | was given the easiest job in the <span class="building">prison</span>, and that was to fill, we didn't have running water in the <span class="interior space">cells</span>, but each one of us would get a <span class="spatial object">water pitcher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash ourselves with. </sentence><sentence id="79">And to fill these <span class="spatial object">pitchers</span> with water. </sentence><sentence id="80">And in doing so, | turned around and there sits my cousin in the adjoining <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">Well we had a very friendly greeting, and surprising so. </sentence><sentence id="82">The moment that | had gotten into <span class="building">prison</span> my mother did not rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me liberated, as well as my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="83">And then followed some six weeks later and | was, which would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Of 1933? </sentence><sentence id="102"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: When | was released from <span class="building">prison</span>, my cousin as well. </sentence><sentence id="104">And | was on parole for two months, which meant that | had to report to a <span class="building">police station</span> every other day. </sentence><sentence id="105">Shall | continue? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Let me take you back just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="107">You mentioned that you were an anti-Nazi but weren't involved in anti-Nazi activities. </sentence><sentence id="108">What did it mean to you at that time, or what kind of activities had you been involved in? </sentence><sentence id="109">What was sort of the culture of anti-Nazism where you were living, when you were | guess about 20 years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="114">With your friends? </sentence><sentence id="115">What were you talking about? </sentence><sentence id="116">What were you doing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of what Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large. </sentence><sentence id="118">The total oppression of several <span class="region">areas</span> and after all, when, | want to be sure that is right. </sentence><sentence id="119">When <span class="country">Germany</span> finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish prisoners in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the anti-Nazi forces were, they were primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists. </sentence><sentence id="121">And who really fought Hitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible. </sentence><sentence id="122">But | had the opportunity, after | was released not only from <span class="building">prison</span> but from the parole, to travel as a salesman within limited scope. </sentence><sentence id="123">Not by <span class="spatial object">car</span> but by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And | never forget that some very simple people who had taken the same <span class="spatial object">train</span> | did in the vicinity of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that Hitler is the enemy of allof <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">By the way, | failed to, when | corrected myself before with regard to the time that | left <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And because of the danger of again being re-arrested in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, | left <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and moved with an Uncle of mine  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And it was May 1S, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="128">The reason that | am pointing out in this very interesting coincidence, | came back to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> on May 1*, 1945, as the conquering American soldier after having liberated <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">I'm not speaking of myself but my regiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: You mentioned that you were afraid in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, that you would be re-arrested. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="145">Was there a sense that they were watching you? </sentence><sentence id="146">It seems that if they arrested you when you went <span class="building">home</span> and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a <span class="building">police prison</span> but it would have meant to be sent to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">Now <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> at that time was not an <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span> but it was a camp of terror. </sentence><sentence id="149">And personally violent persecution. </sentence><sentence id="150">At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape. </sentence><sentence id="152">Now, so | lived in <span class="country">Germany</span> having been relieved from the duty to report to <span class="building">police stations</span>, and | had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And particularly so because on a visit to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, not to my <span class="populated place">village</span>, | had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> in order to spend a pleasant weekend together. </sentence><sentence id="154">When she came <span class="building">home</span> from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the <span class="populated place">village</span> to come to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. </sentence><sentence id="155">We give you the opportunity to defend yourself. </sentence><sentence id="156">My mother had been extremely courageous and  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the <span class="region">area</span> to live with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="157">And that's what she did. </sentence><sentence id="158">And that, the , the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="159">We had an interesting, rewarding time here. </sentence><sentence id="160">Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. </sentence><sentence id="161">And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933. </sentence><sentence id="163">My brother had lived here already. </sentence><sentence id="164">He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children. </sentence><sentence id="165">And my brother entered his <span class="building">business</span> and later on | joined him. </sentence><sentence id="166">We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week. </sentence><sentence id="167">On <span class="dlf">96" Street</span> and <span class="dlf">Western Avenue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the, what's the name of the <span class="building">hotel</span>? </sentence><sentence id="169">The <span class="building">Hotel Paris</span>, which had a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents. </sentence><sentence id="170">And it was really a wonderful way of living. </sentence><sentence id="171">Burdened only by our concern for our in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Can | ask you, before you came over, you sound like you were quite close with your mother, were you having conversations with her about whether you should go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="200">Did she give you any advice about the climate in <span class="country">Germany</span> and how that should effect your decision to, did you talk about that? </sentence><sentence id="201"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton <span class="building">Fritz Schnaittacher 9</span> [Date not labeled] Page 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes indeed. </sentence><sentence id="203">There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="204">There were two brothers of my mother's who were married. </sentence><sentence id="205">And one of them had three children. </sentence><sentence id="206">And my mother insisted that | should leave as soon as possible after | was able to get a visa. </sentence><sentence id="207">And | left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving my mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me. </sentence><sentence id="208">And indeed she did the following year. </sentence><sentence id="209">And stayed in <span class="country">America</span> for over six months. </sentence><sentence id="210">Then because of her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came back to <span class="country">Germany</span> in order to take care of her mother. </sentence><sentence id="211">And it was then, only after the <span class="building">Crystalnaught</span> (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her mother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="212">So we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213">[End of Side 1 of Tape 1] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: It was that they hadn't lost anybody? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="216">So this brings us up to 1939. </sentence><sentence id="217">And when my mother was the first member of the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here. </sentence><sentence id="218">And we hada small <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on <span class="dlf">Western Avenue</span> and <span class="dlf">80" Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And then we, where some cousins had lived, and myself. </sentence><sentence id="220">And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she stayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on <span class="dlf">151% Street</span> and <span class="dlf">Broadway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">Which is the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="populated place">Washington Heights</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">And at that time it was just a wonderful <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">You never, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident. </sentence><sentence id="224">And so my brother, who by then had gotten married and his wife was pregnant, and |, and  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10 my mother and grandmother, we lived in a <span class="interior space">five room</span> <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then, when other Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up. </sentence><sentence id="226">There was never any complaint. </sentence><sentence id="227">There was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to the question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life. </sentence><sentence id="229">There was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't have any children. </sentence><sentence id="230">And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs, started to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they started to do that in our <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">And from there they developed a <span class="building">business</span> where ultimately they employed some forty people on <span class="dlf">26" Street</span> and <span class="dlf">Broadway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">And when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and nephews, not having had any children of their own. </sentence><sentence id="234">And that went for ever so many of the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain themselves. </sentence><sentence id="235">Whether young women that worked in <span class="building">households</span>, or in <span class="building">factory</span> jobs, notwithstanding, very good educations. </sentence><sentence id="236">And this, | think, is one of the unique aspects of this immigration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Can | ask you, did your mother and Uncles and Aunts talk much about their experience in <span class="country">Germany</span> after you left, in the years leading up to the time that they </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262"> 2 What did they tell you about what was going on and what their experiences were? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying experiences that | had. </sentence><sentence id="264">As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton <span class="building">Fritz Schnaittacher 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11 had a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And when he came over here, he told me the following story. </sentence><sentence id="266">When he approached as it was customary his place of business on the morning of the <span class="building">Crystalnaught</span> (ph), the manager of the business, not Jewish, to whom | had been reported when | worked for him, was standing at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to this <span class="building">business</span> in the uniform of a storm trooper, and said, "Jews are not allowed here." </sentence><sentence id="267">And my Uncle did not protest because he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went <span class="building">home</span>, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his <span class="dlf">door</span> and arrested him and took him to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some hundreds of miles away from where he lived. </sentence><sentence id="269">So my two Uncles were taken to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and that was in November 1938. </sentence><sentence id="270">And finally they were able to get out in January of, | believe January of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="271">The Uncle with whom | had lived, the one who had lived in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they received in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, suffered severe circulatory problems and that's what he died from some years later. </sentence><sentence id="272">But this is the story that he told me. </sentence><sentence id="273">So now, we go back, or we advance to the year 1945. </sentence><sentence id="274">Fritz, as a member of the 157"" Regiment of the 45" Division, contributed to the conquest of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">And as soon as | had the time to follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's <span class="building">place of business</span> which had been bombed out, but people were there. </sentence><sentence id="276">And | inquired for the name of Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="277">Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my Uncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back <span class="building">home</span> and having him arrested and taken to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And so this is now May 1945. </sentence><sentence id="279">And | finally got  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 information as to where Hermann lived. </sentence><sentence id="280">And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of locating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span>, and | drove out there. </sentence><sentence id="281">And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived. </sentence><sentence id="282">And there he was. </sentence><sentence id="283">| recognized him at once. </sentence><sentence id="284">And he just wore pants and long johns. </sentence><sentence id="285">And | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed. </sentence><sentence id="286">He didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="287">His wife and daughter protested vehemently. </sentence><sentence id="288">And | took him to the <span class="building">CIC Headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> where | interrogated him. </sentence><sentence id="289">And fortunately for me, because here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out that he had been the guard in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">Which made him subject to automatic arrest. </sentence><sentence id="291">Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category and you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain crimes, such as having been the guard at a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. _ </sentence><sentence id="292">| didn't tell him who | was until | finished the interrogation and | said, "Do you know who | am?" </sentence><sentence id="293">And he said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="294">| said, "My name is Schnaittacher.". </sentence><sentence id="295">So he said, "But you should know how much | did for your Uncle." </sentence><sentence id="296">So | said, "Yes, indeed, | do know." </sentence><sentence id="297">And with that | turned him over to the <span class="building">CIC</span>, who were less humane than | was and at least he was put away in <span class="building">prison</span> for some months. </sentence><sentence id="298">The uniqueness of my
