<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="543">And then they sent a letter to us...1933 in January, challenging us. </sentence><sentence id="544">And on this my wife said, "That's the thing which we need." </sentence><sentence id="545">I said, "I'm...I'm not quite sure about that." </sentence><sentence id="546">And I for the first time in my life was asking God... start to say, "What do you think? </sentence><sentence id="547">What should I do?" </sentence><sentence id="548">And I got somehow a confirmation that I should go at least to find out what is on the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="549">And so I come with my wife and a son. </sentence><sentence id="550">We had Klaus, who was at that time 10 minutes old. </sentence><sentence id="551">And then...in the Bruderhof'I sat, so to say, in the corner and looked through like an _____ you know what...what's the matter here? </sentence><sentence id="552">And then I found out that the true Christ is different from the Christ of the <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">That the true Christ fulfilled really what the Tennah said. </sentence><sentence id="554">It's not so that he was against the Tennah , but he ____ but the CHristians prosecuted the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="555">That's a contradiction. </sentence><sentence id="556">So on the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>, I found the true Christ, not the Christ of the <span class="building">churches</span> and a <span class="populated place">community</span>, and therefore I joined. </sentence><sentence id="557">Now at this moment, Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="558">And Everett Amold who had been...had been judgment of the war had also been led to live in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, he told us the following. </sentence><sentence id="559">Look here. </sentence><sentence id="560">Hitler came out of power, and here he comes in at the Holocaust because the Hitler prepared the Holocaust so to say. </sentence><sentence id="561">And he said, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="562">This Hitler is preparing murder, deaths. </sentence><sentence id="563">We have to give a witness. </sentence><sentence id="564">We have to give a witness of life. </sentence><sentence id="565">Everybody that may cross our lives if we give that...everybody who does not wish to give his life should disappear. </sentence><sentence id="566">And those who wish to give their lives for the truth should stay on the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">And we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="568">A few left, and a few stayed. </sentence><sentence id="569">About 120 stayed on the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> when Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="570">And then we had ...soon had the raids of six police by the Nazis but they couldn't...they...they...couldn't still distinguish between Christian Socialism and Christian communism and political communism, because we are accused of being communists, you know like today.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="606">Q: The communists told? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="608">A: The Communists that if they would come to power, they would...we will be the first to have...be hanged, because we represented another communism which is not...uh...uh...political communism. </sentence><sentence id="609">The Christian communism...you know ...you know, the first Christians in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> were all Jews, and they lived in community. </sentence><sentence id="610">They shared everything they had when the spirit came.

No, I asked one of the Gestapo, "Look here, why do you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="639">He said, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="640">You represent community and we represent community, but you represent community in another spirit than we. </sentence><sentence id="641">Therefore, it's impossible for you and we forbid that you take any guests in." </sentence><sentence id="642">We were forbidden by the Gestapo to take any guests. </sentence><sentence id="643">And...uh...so then...uh...but we didn't...we didn't obey. ( </sentence><sentence id="644">Laughing) We just...any guests we warned from that point, we say, "Look here." </sentence><sentence id="645">Ifa guest came, we say, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="646">If you are here, staying here, you are commit a danger because in <span class="country">Germany</span>, you say, ___ caught with us if you are caught with us, you will be hanged with us. </sentence><sentence id="647">And so those who were fearful left, but those who meant it seriously stayed. </sentence><sentence id="648">And then secondly, they tested the children that they found that the children had no national socialist education, and they said, "We wish to educate your children nationalist socialist," and we said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="649">We can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="650">We don't let you the children go." </sentence><sentence id="651">And then we had adopted a lot of children of people in poverty or who...who father or mother has died, and they tried to...wish to take them away from us. </sentence><sentence id="652">And we did everything to keep them. </sentence><sentence id="653">And...uh...for this reason, I was sent to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, to find a place for...for the children because the children couldn't stay in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="654">And in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> I knew from the time we lived there in <span class="populated place">community</span> and other <span class="populated place">community</span> in <span class="populated place">French Switzerland community</span>, the _, and I went there to ask them and they first wished to educate the children themselves. </sentence><sentence id="655">And I said, "No, we educate our children ourselves." </sentence><sentence id="656">And then in the end, they agreed but said that they'd only take our children if the government is in agreement. </sentence><sentence id="657">And so I went with one of their members next day early to the government in <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span> and in <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span> they said, "Oh, that's not our business. </sentence><sentence id="658">That's the business of the <span class="building">federal government</span>." </sentence><sentence id="659">And so we went to them and they asked, "Why do the children wish to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="660">And we... tried to explain to them quite clearly what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="661">And they were...they said, "Look, why can't the children obey the government, the Swiss government?" </sentence><sentence id="662">And then he said, "Who are you?You speak Swiss-German. </sentence><sentence id="663">You are a Swiss? </sentence><sentence id="664">Who are you? </sentence><sentence id="665">And when they found out that I was a conscious objector, they said, "Of these of your children we wish to have no nothing." </sentence><sentence id="666">It's illegal for your children to come to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">And then I went to <span class="populated place">Prague</span>...uh...to find  out whether there's a possibility for...in all <span class="building">Bruderhofs</span> of the 16th century go in case we are no more tolerated in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">But...uh...] have the recommendation letter to Masserick, Tomas Masserick, the President of that time. </sentence><sentence id="669">A very good recommendation or letter from <span class="country">Switzerland</span> from a friend of his, but he was sick and...and his secretary...press secretary helped me very much. </sentence><sentence id="670">And they found out that all the old places were under the protection of the...law which protected history. </sentence><sentence id="671">And but they offered us <span class="region">lands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">Luckily, we never had to accept that. </sentence><sentence id="673">I went back to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and I had no news for a fort night and I didn't know whether the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> still existed. </sentence><sentence id="674">So I went first to the <span class="building">Umslatz</span> and I tried to find out and nobody could tell whether the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> still existed. </sentence><sentence id="675">And so in the night I sneaked up the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> to find out that the <span class="building">Bruderhof</span> still is there. </sentence><sentence id="676">And it was still there.(Laughing) And I told my experiences, and on this a teacher...this__ left the children for <span class="country">Switzerland</span> illegally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
