class="populated place">camp</span>, and one afternoon, the Kommandant came and said to us -- we were about 20, 2,500 people in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- he said to us, he said, "Any, any of you wants to turn into Christian faith you can do so. </sentence><sentence id="263">You have to go to the <span class="building">church</span> and, and kneel down, and, and, and become Christian. </sentence><sentence id="264">Then you can save your save your life." </sentence><sentence id="265">So you know a drowning man can, he can try to lift with, try to lift up himself with a razor blade, you know, from the <span class="env feature">water</span> -- you know, to save himself. </sentence><sentence id="266">And 99 percent of the Jews in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, they went to <span class="building">church</span> and I myself I've never been a religious man even though my grandfather was very religious, was a Talmud khakhem." </sentence><sentence id="267">And my mother used to have a <span class="building">sheitl</span> -- and all her sisters. </sentence><sentence id="268">I've never been religious, but I just couldn't go to kneel down in, in the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="270">I just -- I said I'd rather die, you know. </sentence><sentence id="271">I remember when these boys came back you, know, from <span class="building">church</span>, they felt Christians. </sentence><sentence id="272">And they were goose-stepping like Christian boys, you know. </sentence><sentence id="273">They had their, their, their face was shined, you know, up. </sentence><sentence id="274">And I --- then I feeled -- felt sorry for God. </sentence><sentence id="275">I was sorry for them. </sentence><sentence id="276">They thought they were delivered from the winds of war to survive. </sentence><sentence id="277">They all died. </sentence><sentence id="278">They all died. </sentence><sentence id="279">Didn't help them, but they thought that it will help them because they turned to the Christian faith. </sentence><sentence id="280">Nothing could have helped them. </sentence><sentence id="281">Even they were their great grandfather was Jewish, they were, they were good as good as the rest. </sentence><sentence id="282">So and later on matter of fact, that was after -- I was just going back to these episodes -- that when I went to, I went to <span class="country">Israel</span> in 1976, and I went to the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> and I passed a monument in the middle of the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> and was written that anybody didn't left his faith under duress, you know, is holy something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="283">So I said, "What is it talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="284">So I went back. </sentence><sentence id="285">I read it again, you know, went back. </sentence><sentence id="286">I, I read it so it was, then I felt good about myself you know that, not because what's a different Christian and the Jews, you know, how they come from the same, they're all Semites you know, the same thing as Jesus Christ was a rabbi himself and I'm sure he'd teach his followers to obeyed his teachings, and every time they didn't listen to him, so such a beautiful words -- "Thy, our Father, which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom comes, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." </sentence><sentence id="287">These beautiful words, they should listen and they should teach their children to honor their savior, the Jesus Christ. </sentence><sentence id="288">They should listen, they should listen and the Christian clergy, they were teaching hatred against us. </sentence><sentence id="289">Why?Many times we asking why they hate us so much. </sentence><sentence id="290">And they -- how many times we try to shake their hands, even in the darkest nights, to be our friends and neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="291">They'd always, they'd always denied their friendship to us and as always blamed their Christian clergy because they are the ones, they are the one, they are, they teach their the, the children of the Christian faith to be antisemitic . </sentence><sentence id="292">They always did, and it's -- and evidently it's didn't stop yet. </sentence><sentence id="293">7 Sage (Yiddish)  So when I was in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> when we went to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">And we worked for the war effort, as a furrier and tailors worked for the different things for, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="295">And how many times we used to get the, the air raids and the, the <span class="spatial object">bombs</span> used to explode, you know, in height in heights and it was saturated bombing. </sentence><sentence id="296">How many times 30, 40 feet from me bombs used to explode and here I am to tell you my story. </sentence><sentence id="297">And then I without a scratch, didn't hit me. </sentence><sentence id="298">In this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, one time, it was September 1944, when the underground organization in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> approached us, few of us, and asked us if we wanted to join the underground fighters. </sentence><sentence id="299">I said, "Yes, of course," I said. </sentence><sentence id="300">So they told us, "Look, you -- sooner or later they're going to kill you. </sentence><sentence id="301">It's just a matter of time." </sentence><sentence id="302">They said, "Why don't you just die with your gun in your hand rather than wait for it, wait till they shoot you." </sentence><sentence id="303">So two, 300 of us joined the -- said, "yes." </sentence><sentence id="304">At a certain time because it was always dark in the night, you know. </sentence><sentence id="305">It was no light was allowed during wartime. </sentence><sentence id="306">Otherwise the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> coming for surveillance or bombing, they could pinpoint the <span class="region">area</span> easier. </sentence><sentence id="307">So, it had to be always dark, darkness. </sentence><sentence id="308">So on a certain date we dug under the <span class="dlf">fence</span> in our <span class="building">compound</span> and during the night we slipped out under the other side of the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and they were waiting for us with pistols. </sentence><sentence id="309">And they used to -- they gave us a pistol and a couple of rounds, couple of magazines of bullets, rounds. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they told us that anybody wants to ask for identification, shoot them right away. </sentence><sentence id="311">Had to shoot them, otherwise they'd shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="312">Because as a Jew -- they what they did is, when they asked for identification from you, and they wasn't satisfied with it, they used to take you under the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and you had to show your penis. </sentence><sentence id="313">It was only Jews, they were they were circumcised in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">So if they showed, they show you your penis they'll shoot you right on the spot, so we had to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="315">That was an order, to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="316">And again we got into the this safe <span class="building">houses</span>, you know, when the this underground fighters they gave us directions you know which way to go and how to get there. </sentence><sentence id="317">We were a little familiar with the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">We got there so the our command--- the commandant, you know, the commandant, he was he was he was 22 years old you know, but he spoke fluent German so he was questioning us, you know, if he want to be sure you know, we're Jew, we're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="319">And we had to show him our penis, you know, we are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="320">In a couple of days he was crash training -- how to use small arms, fire arms and machine guns and grenades, how to throw effectively and in after two days we went to our first job. </sentence><sentence id="321">So there were about 15 of us. </sentence><sentence id="322">So I asked him, where we asked the lieutenant -- we used to call him lieutenant, he was 22 years. </sentence><sentence id="323">His name was Laci, Leslie you know in English. </sentence><sentence id="324">So he said, "You'll find out where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="325">So, first we had to steal a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>." </sentence><sentence id="326">A couple of boys knew how to drive, so they saw a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and we used to follow each other about 50 feet, you know, not to be suspicious you know during the -- it was dark, very dark. </sentence><sentence id="327">So they find the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">They put the, cross the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, and off we went <span class="region">outskirts</span> to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, because <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> is two -- the <span class="env feature">River Danube</span> divides it. </sentence><sentence id="329">One side is Pest. </sentence><sentence id="330">One side is <span class="populated place">Buda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">So, that's why they call it "<span class="populated place">Budapest</span>." </sentence><sentence id="332">So, we went to <span class="populated place">Buda</span>, the other side of the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">So, finally we had a discussion that says we're going into this <span class="building">ammunition dump</span>,  but it was circled and was pro-protected with the Hungarian patrol. </sentence><sentence id="334">So, he went there by himself alone. </sentence><sentence id="335">He was dressed as a Hungarian officer uniform. </sentence><sentence id="336">He spoke fluent German and Hungarian, of course. </sentence><sentence id="337">He was asking for the -- he was asking direction. </sentence><sentence id="338">So, we park that <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, you know, for a short distance from this <span class="building">ammunition dump</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">Two guys, both side, two, always two of us one side and two on the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">Two patrols. </sentence><sentence id="341">We grabbed the <span class="spatial object">patrol</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">We was told what to do you know before. </sentence><sentence id="343">Close his mouth with the <span class="spatial object">bayonet</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="344">We had to stab him that many times and this has to be repeated about two, three times before we got into the <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, <span class="building">dump</span>, <span class="building">dump site</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">So there we gathered all we could -- the most important thing was <span class="dlf">mine</span> -- to get <span class="dlf">mines</span> to -- because our purpose was to delay their supplies and sabotage their <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, you know, the supply. </sentence><sentence id="346">So we got as many, much heavy machine guns can and grenades and mines, as much as we could carry, you know, 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="347">And we loaded the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> -- we loaded -- got the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> loaded and about two sappers stayed behind to, you know what a <span class="spatial object">sapper</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="348">They put four, five different places but <span class="dlf">mines</span> in into the <span class="building">ammunition dump</span> in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="349">Didn't go more than 500 yards. </sentence><sentence id="350">We saw the like a fires -- what do you call it -- blaze, you know. </sentence><sentence id="351">It was like we destroyed the <span class="building">ammunition dump</span> you know, when it were up. </sentence><sentence id="352">They were searching for us all over you know. </sentence><sentence id="353">And they were going to spy, disperse the personnel, you know. </sentence><sentence id="354">They had to hide. </sentence><sentence id="355">The mine was the most important thing we have to go in during the evening at night to mine the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> and <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">So, but they start to repairing it you know, the faster and faster, the because they had no more men than we were, you know, the army, you know, the Hungarian army and German collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="357">So it was, it was -- I remember the date -- was it September, September 1944, and Horthy,(r) I told you that Horthy Miklos -- he was chancellor already in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and this visit came out from <span class="country">Hungary</span> on a false pretense and this Jew-hater Szalasi, he took over the reign, and he was a well-known Jew-hater. </sentence><sentence id="358">He was worse than Horthy Mikles, but when he spirited Horthy Mikles out they called him he was he was a Jewish collaborator already, Horthy Mikles. </sentence><sentence id="359">Besides they call him anything else. </sentence><sentence id="360">So in March, in September seven -- 17, we heard on the radio that they going to make a big parade, when they took over the reign from <span class="populated place">Horthy</span>, on <span class="dlf">Vilmos csaszar street</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">So we had the order from the American and British intelligence, because we worked for them because that's the <span class="spatial object">underground fighter</span> -- they told us that we actually worked for the British-American intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="362">And we got our reward -- they will reward us you know after the -- after we do a good jo-- good job. </sentence><sentence id="363">Who cares what they going to reward us? </sentence><sentence id="364">What they going to do?But nevertheless, about 200 of us waited for the columns of the parade on Vilmos csaszar * Mikles Horthy " <span class="dlf">Ferenc Szalasi  street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">We, the night before we placed heavy machine gun and all kind of fire equipment, you know, with submachine gun and grenades and you name it. </sentence><sentence id="366">We had it. </sentence><sentence id="367">Pistols, were 200 of us. </sentence><sentence id="368">Two hundred people, you know, could do a lot of lot of damage. </sentence><sentence id="369">I remember the waiting in the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and from the <span class="interior space">cellars</span>, wherever we were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="370">And we heard the <span class="spatial object">column</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">The <span class="spatial object">column</span> was coming and saw the cheering of the Christians well wishers, you know, with the fascist flags. </sentence><sentence id="372">They were waving fascist flags and, and sitting on -- they have <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and spick-and-span uniforms, you know, the people who go on the parade.

I lost conscious. </sentence><sentence id="975">The only -- when I woke up, I woke up from a smell. </sentence><sentence id="976">I don't know how long I was unconscious, maybe a day or two, but if because if I would have been alive, they would have shot me, or stabbed me with the bayonets stabbed, would have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="977">But -- the Russian forces that came so rapid-rapidly they advanced -- they had to pull out fast. </sentence><sentence id="978">And they didn't have much time to look around. </sentence><sentence id="979">Maybe I was -- I didn't have any motion. </sentence><sentence id="980">Didn't show any motion in where I was. </sentence><sentence id="981">Probably, I was ina coma, in a temporary coma, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="982">And they left me. </sentence><sentence id="983">When I woke up, that I, from the smell. </sentence><sentence id="984">What happened is that I was, when I was on the <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> on the sleeping ,or sta-- laying down, there was a little <span class="dlf">hole</span> for air, you know, on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> -- not a <span class="dlf">window</span>, just a little <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">So through that <span class="dlf">hole</span> the bombs they exploded in the <span class="interior space">latrine</span> and sprayed the, the life-giving ammonia smell on me. </sentence><sentence id="986">Was all covered with the feces, of human feces. </sentence><sentence id="987">And I woke up from the smell. </sentence><sentence id="988">And I looked around. </sentence><sentence id="989">I couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="990">I was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="991">And I saw hundreds of bodies of boys that di-- they were dead, dead. </sentence><sentence id="992">Motionless in a form of different grotesque of motioning -- you know, they was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="993">And I looked to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="994">I saw a man in uniform at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="995">He didn't come in. </sentence><sentence id="996">He was afraid to come in, with a, with a sub-machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="997">And I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="998">He was motioning at me to come outside. </sentence><sentence id="999">Well, I was trying to get out, get down. </sentence><sentence id="1000">You know, I was the third <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I was -- I couldn't come down, was so weak. </sentence><sentence id="1002">But finally about a couple of hours later I finally came down. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I fainted I don't know how many times. </sentence><sentence id="1004">You know, I came down from the, from the <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, and I finally got to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1005">He never touched me. </sentence><sentence id="1006">This, a couple of soldiers came around, and they looked inside. </sentence><sentence id="1007">They saw all the dead bodies and they were afraid, you know, to come inside. </sentence><sentence id="1008">So I said to -- they asked me, you know, things but I didn't understand them. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I, first of all, I couldn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And I didn't have hair. </sentence><sentence id="1011">They lost that's a symptom of the fleck typhus -- you loose your hearing and they're finding out later that and you loose your hearing and you loose your hair. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But I have, still have the yellow armband on me. </sentence><sentence id="1013">So a couple of -- I couldn't hear them but I, the couple of words I know from a friend of mine -- they were Slovak and they and I know "yid2!"Zid, Zid," you know -- I know what this means? </sentence><sentence id="1014">Means "Jew, Jew." </sentence><sentence id="1015">And they understood "Zid," because the, the Russians, they, they know what "zid" is. </sentence><sentence id="1016">They used that many times themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1017">So, so they talked to me but I didn't understand them. </sentence><sentence id="1018">So one of them 21 Jew (Slovakian)  gave me a piece of bread and a piece of bacon, you know, to me. </sentence><sentence id="1019">Luckily I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1020">I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1021">I was -- that was my main luck, but it was good luck I couldn't eat because I would have, if I would have eat a piece of bacon and would have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I found out that later, but I don't know why -- I just couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1023">So he was motioning to me to go back to the -- there were <span class="dlf">front lines</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1024">The <span class="dlf">Russian line</span> was in <span class="dlf">trenches</span> on one side and the <span class="region">German other side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1025">They were cross firing at each other. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And I'm telling you I was walking right across between the crossfire without a scratch. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And one time a Russian soldier motioning at me to come to him, and he want to tell me something. </sentence><sentence id="1028">But I couldn't hear him, hear. </sentence><sentence id="1029">He wanted me to lay low. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I didn't know what he was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Like I said, I was going every 10, 15 feet I had to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I was very weak from the sickness. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So I was -- I remember I walked through the <span class="region">no-man's land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And finally I walked all day I suppose, because I remember about one and half or two kilometers you know and came to this <span class="building">artillery position</span> this <span class="building">Russian artillery position</span>, and this guy, and this Russian saw me the yellow star, yellow armband. </sentence><sentence id="1036">He wants to give me a loaf, gave me a loaf of bread and a piece of bacon. </sentence><sentence id="1037">I remember holding that loaf of bread and piece of bacon. </sentence><sentence id="1038">I was squeezing to my body. </sentence><sentence id="1039">It was all mine. </sentence><sentence id="1040">You know, it was something else, you know, that piece of bread you know. </sentence><sentence id="1041">So I was going back that -- it was a <span class="dlf">front line</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1042">We, I wanted to get away from as far as I can because any minute, you know, the, the counter-attack it could come from the German and it was bad to worse, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1043">So, I went to went to -- finally I went to few kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Constantly harassing, you know, the Russians -- they were asking identification. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Many times just looked at, looked at me and they looked, search in my <span class="spatial object">pocket</span> -- they find a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1046">They just let me let me go further back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1047">You know, it was still in <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1048">But one day I got into this <span class="building">headquarters</span>, a <span class="building">Russian headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I didn't know I where I was. </sentence><sentence id="1050">I was -- I sat down on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and they wanted to, wanted to know what I was doing there, you know, the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1051">So one officer came out and he said to me, "Du bist ein Jude?"" </sentence><sentence id="1052">in German. </sentence><sentence id="1053">I said to him, "Jawohl, jawohl.""* </sentence><sentence id="1054">I could have hear a little, little bit because it was a few days after, after the, I was liberated. " </sentence><sentence id="1055">Ich bin ein Jude." </sentence><sentence id="1056">Then I said to him, "Shema Israel." </sentence><sentence id="1057">So he said "Shema Israel," himself . </sentence><sentence id="1058">So he got me a horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> with a soldier, Russian soldiers, and without a stop that horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> took me about 20 kilometers to the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span>, to <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, to -- you know, for <span class="building">hospital</span> for Russian soldiers or some civilians. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Over there in the <span class="building">hospital</span> they de-liced me, you know, and washed me and they told me that next day they're going to ship me over to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, you know, on that <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1060">So following day they took me over to the <span class="building">veteran's hospital</span> and they want to give us food you know but lucky I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1061">They were hundreds of hundreds of Jewish boys. </sentence><sentence id="1062">They were somehow they escaped the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1063">They were eating and eating " Are you a Jew? ( </sentence><sentence id="1064">German) 23 Yes, sir (German) "Tama Jew (German)  and eating. </sentence><sentence id="1065">They were dying and dying and dying. </sentence><sentence id="1066">They were died -- hundreds of them, by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="1067">They would -- "til they realized what's the problem. </sentence><sentence id="1068">You know -- they were all over-eating. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And I feel like a million dollar you know -- they gave me a cup you know to -- and there was no lice on me or torment -- our tormented bodies, you know, was shrunken to like a just a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="1070">But I wanted to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I didn't know if anybody's, anybody came back you know. </sentence><sentence id="1072">First it was 200 kilometer to go to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, you know, because from <span class="country">Austria</span> to go <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> is 200 kilometers, and from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> to my <span class="populated place">town</span> is another 200 kilometers, that's -- and in wartime they couldn't get the <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1073">It was -- everything was for war effort. </sentence><sentence id="1074">And but one day -- I was there in the <span class="building">hospital</span> maybe 10 days, and my gain, my weight gained about -- I was at least eighty pounds at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1075">So I left. </sentence><sentence id="1076">I didn't have clothes on me, because they destroyed all my clothes because all they infested, you know, with lice, so on the Schwester,"&gt; got me some old clothes from two, three sizes larger than -- she felt sorry for me. </sentence><sentence id="1077">But nevertheless I had something on. </sentence><sentence id="1078">So I was walking there and a boy came with a horse, one horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and stopped and said to me, Hungarian said, "You want to get a ride? </sentence><sentence id="1079">Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="1080">I said, "I go, you know, toward <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1081">He said, "Come." </sentence><sentence id="1082">So he pulled me up, said, "Well, where, where have you been?" </sentence><sentence id="1083">He said, "I was nearby in this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1084">He escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1085">He said he was hiding in the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> and luckily the -- didn't burn, you know, the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span>, and he, he escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Usually it was a large <span class="spatial object">haystack</span>, because they would they were going with the <span class="spatial object">bayonet</span> many times you know all around just to make sure you know nobody in inside, but he was evidently miss him. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And didn't burn, so he escaped by chance, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1088">But we went to this <span class="populated place">village</span> and the Russians patrol stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Says, says -- starts talking to us. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Not, not four letter words, but 10 letter words, you know. " </sentence><sentence id="1091">You so and so," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1092">"Where you get the horse? </sentence><sentence id="1093">Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="1094">So the other boy, he spoke a little Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Slovak and Russian are similar, you know, Slovak language. </sentence><sentence id="1096">So, so the sol-- the Russian soldier -- before he finish his -- all the sentence, we jumped off from the -- from horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, said, "You can have the horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1097">They will shoot us, you know, the it was, the lawlessness was law, you know, those days and the strong was the -- weak was the pawn you know and the strong was the rule -- the ruler. </sentence><sentence id="1098">But nevertheless, I always -- I'm grateful to the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1099">They were the ones they liberate-liberated me, you know, the even though -- because the politic is -- the politic is something else, yet. </sentence><sentence id="1100">This is something else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Nevertheless, they saved, they saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1102">If they didn't come in days or hours sometimes you know made a big difference between life and death. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So we got some somehow we got on this <span class="building">station</span>, got into this <span class="building">Hungarian station</span>, <span class="spatial object">train</span> deg&gt; <span class="building">Nurse (German)  station</span> and we find this <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1104">You know, there are a lot of <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1105">We asked the <span class="building">stationmaster</span> we could hitch a ride. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Said, "Go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="1107">So we didn't we didn't know which way the <span class="spatial object">train</span> goes. </sentence><sentence id="1108">We want to go, get away from there the worst way. </sentence><sentence id="1109">We got into this <span class="populated place">town</span> and there were thousands and thousands of people Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="1110">They were trying to get a ride you know. </sentence><sentence id="1111">It was <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> was unheard, you know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1112">But they were -- everybody wanted to go <span class="building">home</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1113">So finally, we got on this <span class="spatial object">train</span>, was heading, heading someplace. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Everybody jumped in, jumped on the in the <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> and the flat <span class="spatial object">train</span> you know, the flat <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1115">You saw them for <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Many times they used to used them for <span class="spatial object">tank carriers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1117">I remember one -- I was sitting at the edge of the one night we were going and there was sitting 100 people, 120 people -- I don't know how many could have sit or, or hang on to this to this <span class="spatial object">flat car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And I was sitting on the edge, and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going slow but was shaking up and down, and I fell. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I remember, fell between that the -- the <span class="spatial object">train</span> I mean on the on the -- so I somehow I threw myself out between the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, because it was go slow, but instinct, I throw myself out. </sentence><sentence id="1120">They pulled me back, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They couldn't kill me you know. </sentence><sentence id="1122">So well finally we had so much tsuris, you know, we, we took days, but we got into <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And I had an uncle in <span class="populated place">Buda</span>, in, in, in <span class="populated place">Buda</span>, before the war, and his wife and two, two of, of, of their children. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I figured maybe they're <span class="building">home</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1125">We didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So I got it; I knew their address. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So to me, I was dressed, you know, I would look like I had a piece of rope tied around my -- with waist with holding my, my coat. </sentence><sentence id="1128">It was large, and most, most of the Christians, they thought I'm coming from the <span class="building">home</span> from the <span class="populated place">prisoners of war camp</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So I, I got into there, there, to my uncle's place to walk, and, and my uncle was <span class="building">home</span> and my, my aunt was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1130">They, they somehow survived. </sentence><sentence id="1131">They went to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and other -- and they, they wait around. </sentence><sentence id="1132">They have some, they bought some papers from the, from -- they got some papers from the Swedish government with something, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1133">They, they survived under the pho- under the Christian name, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1134">They were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1135">But they, they were just by luck, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1136">If the war would have lasted a little longer, they would have been dead also you know. </sentence><sentence id="1137">It was just the timing, it was important. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And when they saw me, they first didn't recognize me right away. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And they saw, she starts screaming, Aunt Margit, "It's you Miklos!" </sentence><sentence id="1140">We call -- Hungarians used to call me "Mikles." </sentence><sentence id="1141">Oh, how I looked ter- terrible, I looked. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And she starts screaming about that, because their two, they have two daughters that didn't come <span class="building">home</span> from the -- from that time which was in April, and, and the war was still going on all over. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And they asked, and they are screaming that even I came <span class="building">home</span> already and their children, you know, their parents are you know, the, the -- their children they didn't come and somebody else came <span class="building">home</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1144">But nevertheless, she was all right. </sentence><sentence id="1145">She was -- cooked some something, some, some, some food for me, and I ate some food. </sentence><sentence id="1146"> And -- but to go <span class="building">home</span>, you know, from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, from that was -- that it was a terrible thing from, from my <span class="populated place">home-hometown</span> because the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> was, it was bombed and it was it took a lot of time, you know, to repair and, and that time. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And so we slowly but, slowly but surely -- many times, we -- the, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> had to stop and, and, and the Russian soldiers came and identification and, and they used to select some young, young people for, for the war effort, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1148">They all shipped them to -- the war prisoners -- to, to <span class="country">Russia</span> or they, they used them first for labor, for, for, for laborers, you know, for whatever reason it is. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Many times they start shooting, you know, indiscriminately, to scare the population. </sentence><sentence id="1150">There was no-nobody could have say "no," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They, they couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1152">They, they were the rulers that time in, in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And their atrocities was terrible, you know -- the <span class="country">Russian</span> atrocities, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1154">But -- and the, the wounded or whatever was laying around by 10s of 10s of wounded. </sentence><sentence id="1155">No one could have helped them. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Was screaming, all over the, the place. </sentence><sentence id="1157">But, I remember my, my uncle gave me 100 peng. </sentence><sentence id="1158">At that time that value was -- maybe I could have buy three kilogram of bread, you know, for it. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And he told me that, "When you have enough money," you know, to give it back to him, because they didn't have enough. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So, I said "sure." </sentence><sentence id="1161">So on the way <span class="building">home</span>, so I used that 100 peng6 to buy a little bread, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1162">For, for money you can always get something, you know, for the, for the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1163">So sometimes I even bought an onion, an onion to, to season up the, the my menu, you know, the pie-- little bread and onion. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And finally I got <span class="building">home</span>, and you'd be surprised that it was 400 kilometers from the, from the <span class="dlf">front line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1165">It was, the life was going on just like, just like nor-- it was normal, but very, very normal. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Like, you know, we go to buy things. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So first I, I went to -- I went, I remember stopped the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and all my memories came to me. </sentence><sentence id="1168">You know, I was -- want go <span class="building">home</span>, because my uncle didn't know if anybody lived in my, my, my <span class="building">home</span> because they didn't have communication, didn't have telephone. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Nobody had <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> those days. </sentence><sentence id="1170">So, I, I went <span class="building">home</span> and it was in the evening, and I find -- I met on the main <span class="dlf">street</span> -- it was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, you know, my -- I find a friend of mine, was grown up. </sentence><sentence id="1171">His name also was Laci. </sentence><sentence id="1172">So, we start crying each other, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1173">Although at first didn't recognize, didn't recognize me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Asked him, anybody <span class="building">home</span>, you know because we were 1,200 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So, we ordered, we 12 of us here, <span class="building">home</span> from the 1,200, 12 people, all between 21, 22, 23 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1176">As he said to me, "Come to me. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Sleep with, sleep in my place," he said. </sentence><sentence id="1178">He, he was freed in January, and this was in April already, so he got married. </sentence><sentence id="1179">He married a girl, and he slept over one night. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And said, "Tomorrow morning, he said, "Go and see. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Go to your place and see what happened." </sentence><sentence id="1182">So next morning I went to my father's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1183">The <span class="building">houses</span> was built, you know; it was all <span class="building">mud houses</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1184">It -- was like made from mud bricks, the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence
