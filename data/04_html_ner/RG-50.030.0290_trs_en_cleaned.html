<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Were you close with your mother, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="82">I had a wonderful mother. </sentence><sentence id="83">She was the opposite, very quiet, very refined lady who always looked for me to help out, but I was never around because I was busy, as I said, having fun. </sentence><sentence id="84">But she had help, but she was a lovely lady, unassuming and very gentle and very kind and I loved her very much. </sentence><sentence id="85">She was a very pretty lady. </sentence><sentence id="86">I remember on high holidays she used to get dressed up always in a grey wool suit with a silver fox fur for not a collar, but it was called a shawl. </sentence><sentence id="87">And she was blond, and every year she used to go to the women who used to make hats and the hat was always open on top so her blond hair would show and an large, large brim. </sentence><sentence id="88">And whenever she used to walk in the <span class="building">synagog</span> for the high holidays, people looked at her. </sentence><sentence id="89">She was tall and a very nice lady. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Were you religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="102">Well of course we were kosher in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">I wouldn't say we were ultra religious, but we were kosher at <span class="building">home</span>, and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and Passover and traditional, I would call it. </sentence><sentence id="104">Then, of course, when the Russians came into <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was afraid they were going to send us to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, he started planning on how we should get out of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less established to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave. </sentence><sentence id="108">That was in 1939, and at that time, we had relatives in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and one time they sent us a letter asking us to help them, because they had this <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were store keepers and one day the Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away the head of the family from the <span class="building">store</span> and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few days. </sentence><sentence id="110">We just want to interrogate him. </sentence><sentence id="111">The next day, two days later, they came back with a little box, which in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and handed her the box, put it on the <span class="spatial object">counter</span> and said, "this is your husband." </sentence><sentence id="112">So, this was the letter we received in "39. </sentence><sentence id="113">And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they did arrive in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, but is didn't sound real. </sentence><sentence id="114">It just didn't sound that people could do that to other people. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my father kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on running away at that time from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, he started somehow plotting things out how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="117">So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to  see his family because he came from <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">I'm just digressing because I just wanted to show you what a great man he was in a way. </sentence><sentence id="119">He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative, but he was exceptionally supportive of me. </sentence><sentence id="120">I don't know, but he really was. </sentence><sentence id="121">Before the Russians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was grey wool, fur collar, a trench coat with a belt, very sharp. </sentence><sentence id="123">So, my father took the coat and said he was going to see his family in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and behind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink. </sentence><sentence id="124">He felt that in case something is going to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell the mink for my mother and my brother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="125">That is the kind of family I grew up. </sentence><sentence id="126">I really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four years, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="127">It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be caught in between. </sentence><sentence id="128">It could have happened to anybody who was there. </sentence><sentence id="129">That to destroy the rest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live in the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="160">Was it a great place to grow up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="163"> A Yes, I had no difficulties. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: The <span class="populated place">city</span>, I mean, were there things to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="168">There was this <span class="building">school</span> we went to, they had all kind of functions. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was a very good <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And then of course in the winter time we had the <span class="building">ice skating rinks</span> with the music, and we used to go outside and play and dance and do all these wild things, which were wild then. </sentence><sentence id="171">Then I belonged to <span class="building">Macabe</span>, which is an organization, which is a sport organization. </sentence><sentence id="172">I used to spend my days there. </sentence><sentence id="173">I was the ping pong champion. </sentence><sentence id="174">And in the summer we went to the <span class="country">country</span> where I used to hike. </sentence><sentence id="175">I really, maybe I never encountered any problems. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was always exposed to Jewish people, <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, except for the people who were dealing with my father, who were exceptionally nice, too, because apparently they needed his product. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: So you didn't have any difficulties? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: You had a nice life. </sentence><sentence id="192">Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="196">Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, I always expected to survive. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I really attributed it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="198">I'm serious, because in retrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came. </sentence><sentence id="199">He really instilled in me a tremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll make it if you want it badly enough. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians came in. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: What sorts of opportunities were taken away from you at that time? </sentence><sentence id="204">How did your life change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: You mean to leave <span class="country">Lithuania</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: No, just in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> when the Russians were there, were certain things prohibited to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="211">Could you continue to practice your religion. </sentence><sentence id="212">Did you still go to <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="213">Was everything basically the same, or did it change? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate the people. </sentence><sentence id="215">Never to leave the same people in the same <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">So, what they did, the first thing they did was to move me from my <span class="building">school</span> to another <span class="building">school</span> where I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="217">I did know some, but -- and the people from the other <span class="building">school</span> were moved to my <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up. </sentence><sentence id="219">And, they also, of course introduced all Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="220">I wouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day they'll come and just take us to <span class="country">Siberia</span> because everybody around us, whoever was in business, that's where they wound up. </sentence><sentence id="221">The <span class="spatial object">truck</span> used to come, just like the Germans actually. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had the same system. </sentence><sentence id="223">Without warning, they used to knock at your <span class="dlf">door</span> and say, "Come, take whatever you can just take with you." </sentence><sentence id="224">Put you on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, put you on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and send you to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, that was our only fear at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Did you know people that were going to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, did you know where they were going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing. </sentence><sentence id="241">They did have some inclination of what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="242">The people, especially who are in business, who are employing people. </sentence><sentence id="243">So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had. </sentence><sentence id="244">But, otherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new <span class="building">school</span>, and I kept on doing my own thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us. </sentence><sentence id="253">Probably the people who were religious it affected them. </sentence><sentence id="254">But I don't recall going to <span class="building">Temple</span> that year for all the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="255">That's something that is kind of murky in my mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Do you remember the first day of the war in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Yes, I do, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was 1941, June 21, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="263">That was a day that I was supposed to go to my <span class="building">school</span>, my original <span class="building">school</span> to pick up my diploma because I had graduated from <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to put on a pair of silk stockings. </sentence><sentence id="265">I walked to <span class="building">school</span>, which was quite a distance, and I picked up my diploma. </sentence><sentence id="266">It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked <span class="building">home</span>, and as I passed where the President of <span class="country">Lithuania</span> lived, suddenly something fell out from an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>, because they bombed the President's <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">I fell on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">I got up. </sentence><sentence id="269">I wasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings. </sentence><sentence id="270">I came <span class="building">home</span>, and we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that we did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, and we hoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at that time. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were already caught between the devil and the , </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Can you describe the atmosphere in the <span class="dlf">street</span> at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: It was chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="275">It was very, very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="276">It's very difficult to describe the chaos. </sentence><sentence id="277">People really didn't know what to do, because they were trapped. </sentence><sentence id="278">We were really just trapped. </sentence><sentence id="279">We couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="280">We didn't have weapons. </sentence><sentence id="281">We didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="282">We didn't have anybody on our side. </sentence><sentence id="283">It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually the Lithuanians started before the Germans started. </sentence><sentence id="284">So, they started looting and screaming and yelling and beating us up. </sentence><sentence id="285">So, we didn't know which way to turn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: You saw this and this was just all around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes. </sentence><sentence id="301">We kept our <span class="dlf">door</span> locked, and we were lucky that they must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">They were terrible, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was such like, like I said, I never had any contact with them before, but they turned like animals. </sentence><sentence id="304">It was just neighbors, people who you dealt with. </sentence><sentence id="305">They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs and so it was rough. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was really rough. </sentence><sentence id="307">You know, I read a book by an author by the name of Bothenheimer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="308">He's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="309">I'm just telling you a little story about it. </sentence><sentence id="310">I belong to a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they were being taken by the Germans to a <span class="building">hotel</span> and that eventually they would be staying there until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="311">I was the only survivor. </sentence><sentence id="312">The rest of the people in the group were Americans. </sentence><sentence id="313">And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could you be. </sentence><sentence id="314">Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="315">Couldn't you just stand up against the Lithuanians? </sentence><sentence id="316">There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers around you. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak, or that we were like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="318">We had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="319">How can you just protect yourself against a bunch of mad dogs. </sentence><sentence id="320">You just can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="321">I mean people did it, and they were immediately killed in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="322">So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it without making any waves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were  running around beating people, can you describe what else was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: Not really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="349">Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at <span class="building">home</span> most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="350">We wouldn't dare walk out of the <span class="building">house</span> until they came around with those loud speakers directing us what to do. </sentence><sentence id="351">But we packed. </sentence><sentence id="352">We packed mostly silver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't experienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less than that, we lived a relative normal life. </sentence><sentence id="353">Really, a normal life, but when something happens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest. </sentence><sentence id="354">You kind of know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="355">And you start thinking, you don't need a <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>, you don't need extra clothes, you need something that you can trade eventually. </sentence><sentence id="356">So, we took the silver and some of the jewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something, because there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold here now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold. </sentence><sentence id="357">It was not synthetic. </sentence><sentence id="358">And we knew that the farmers outside in the <span class="country">country</span> will be glad to acquire it, to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="359">Not that we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the <span class="populated place">city</span> and killed. </sentence><sentence id="373">Was this something that you were aware of at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: No, no I found out later on. </sentence><sentence id="377">Like I said, we were just lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Did you have any contact with the <span class="region">Jewish part</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="populated place">Slobotka</span> (ph), at this point, or were you separated? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="403">Then we were told that we had to go to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> because they were going to have a separate place, a <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="404">All they kept on yelling was and we took whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="405">Now, I don't remember how we got there. </sentence><sentence id="406">I totally forget. </sentence><sentence id="407">I mean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how we got there. </sentence><sentence id="408">I know we didn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="409">It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite a lot of stuff by the time we came to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really -- it's blank. </sentence><sentence id="410">All I know is that we wound up in a small <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, which was called at that time the <span class="populated place">Small Ghetto</span> and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were brought in that particular part of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then after a short period of time, they started coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the  ones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something with stuff. </sentence><sentence id="412">They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big which was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up the <span class="region">area</span>, and we were told to come out on the <span class="dlf">field</span>, four in a row. </sentence><sentence id="413">Actually eight in a row. </sentence><sentence id="414">We started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the same <span class="dlf">row</span> with the four of us, and they were the other four. </sentence><sentence id="415">And they said, everybody eight in a <span class="dlf">row</span> and just walk. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be 18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel. </sentence><sentence id="417">They just walked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family on one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="418">We didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="419">It turned out that her side was the <span class="region">bad side</span>, and these people from that particular <span class="region">side</span> never came back. </sentence><sentence id="420">They were taken and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="421">Now, all I can contribute it to is luck. </sentence><sentence id="422">She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her family. </sentence><sentence id="423">We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just lucky. </sentence><sentence id="424">So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we had to move to another <span class="region">area</span> in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who are, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="458">They had names and these people who were actually dealing with <span class="country">Germany</span> for years, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932, and who were professional people. </sentence><sentence id="459">They all went, hoping that they would be able to do something to negotiate with the Germans or influence them. </sentence><sentence id="460">They were called out, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="461">This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="462">So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in retrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population. </sentence><sentence id="463">End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: Like what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: Well, the Germans, they were kind of decent, and they said if you will accomplish your, what do you call it, if you'll accomplish what you're supposed to do, your quota, you will be able to get some extra flour from the farmers around. </sentence><sentence id="523">So, that is what everybody worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="524">Whether you do or you don't, you don't get anything, but here you are told what you will be getting. </sentence><sentence id="525">We certainly were very conscientious. </sentence><sentence id="526">So, we got flour, and what I had to do, I had to divide and kind of weigh the flour and divide the portions to every single person. </sentence><sentence id="527">But, I was so generous that a few times there was none left for me. </sentence><sentence id="528">So, my husband told me, at that time he wasn't my husband, he said don't be so generous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="536">Q: You were also doing the heavy manual labor? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Yes, yes, yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="538">But this is once in a while that they wanted to be kind they would say, yes, but I was working. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: What other kind of <span class="building">work brigades</span> were you on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: That's the only one. </sentence><sentence id="542">I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young women to take on a <span class="dlf">farm</span> to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">They dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="545">I got up in the morning and walked out on the <span class="dlf">farm</span> and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big horse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us. </sentence><sentence id="546">We were about 18, 20 women approximately and he picked me and he said to me "Have you ever ridden a horse?" </sentence><sentence id="547">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="548">He said, "Good, it's time to learn." </sentence><sentence id="549">So he got off the horse, and he removed the <span class="spatial object">saddle</span>, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did something to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to myself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it. </sentence><sentence id="550">Then I finally came down, he said, "Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables." </sentence><sentence id="551">So, I was there for a couple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: Why did he ask you to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="599">A: Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way. </sentence><sentence id="600">We met, we kissed, we drank, we had fun when we had the opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="601">The young ones, we really tried to live as normal a life as you could. </sentence><sentence id="602">You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="603">We have no responsibilities, we have no children. </sentence><sentence id="604">We have no family. </sentence><sentence id="605">Now, my mother had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="606">I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the children here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="607">She saw her child being killed, being put on a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="608">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="609">When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother  0 had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="610">But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="611">He really came through. </sentence><sentence id="612">He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart determined young boy. </sentence><sentence id="613">First of all, he was tall. </sentence><sentence id="614">He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all and that was in his favor because every time he used to go to <span class="building">work</span>, he used to just leave the place and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my mother gave him. </sentence><sentence id="615">My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they would wait for the next piece. </sentence><sentence id="616">He really supported the family. </sentence><sentence id="617">When my mother had her stroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there for her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could walk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="618">So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's different. </sentence><sentence id="619">Because you know youth, we'll overcome. </sentence><sentence id="620">You cannot help it, so we'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="621">It's careless, I don't think it was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this one is gone and that one is gone. </sentence><sentence id="622">The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also, they are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun. </sentence><sentence id="623">For young people it was bad, but not as bad as for my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="652">No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day and work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were safer. </sentence><sentence id="653">I think we got married after that incident on the <span class="dlf">farm</span> because I wouldn't say it was safer to be married. </sentence><sentence id="654">I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father for my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the one who will, and my father was absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="655">So, we got married. </sentence><sentence id="656">Not that it mattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually. </sentence><sentence id="657">But everybody felt that if you were married you were kind of safer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1177">A: We were put into open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, always open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1178">This is why for the life of me I cannot understand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1179">They always saw us. </sentence><sentence id="1180">The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And the Germans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an <span class="region">area</span> where they divided us into groups. </sentence><sentence id="1182">And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman about my age, walked over to me and she said, "Do you mind if I join you because everybody was taken away from me." </sentence><sentence id="1183">I said sure, why don't you join us. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And then about after a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were going to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little bit older. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And they said,"You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your group so we can stick together." </sentence><sentence id="1186">So, we spent the rest of our time together actually. </sentence><sentence id="1187">So, then they put us again in one of these open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and took us to work in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, to build <span class="dlf">ditches</span> for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the moment, but it will come to me. </sentence><sentence id="1188">So what they did is they housed us in <span class="building">tents</span>, in regular <span class="building">tents</span>, as you see here. </sentence><sentence id="1189">They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the <span class="building">tent</span> was a little <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, one of those <span class="spatial object">wood burning stoves</span>, and they gave us a <span class="interior space">space</span> on straw which this is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one <span class="interior space">corner</span>, and we stuck together the five of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1259">Q: Were there any children there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1261">A: No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I mean, we didn't have our period. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Thank God there was something in <span class="dlf">heaven</span>, somebody was watching over us. </sentence><sentence id="1264">We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going to sterilize all the young women. </sentence><sentence id="1265">So, when we finally got into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, got up every morning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep <span class="dlf">ditches</span>, and then it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And it was cold, and I used to break up the <span class="env feature">ice</span> when I went in. </sentence><sentence id="1267">There was a break once in a while, and get into the <span class="env feature">ice</span> and wash myself because the biggest killer almost, and demoralizer, was the filth. </sentence><sentence id="1268">The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us decided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people around us were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Especially older people, also many young ones that gave up. </sentence><sentence id="1270">They just didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1271">That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this is what we -- two things we promised ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1272">We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter was coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you. </sentence><sentence id="1273">They did not tolerate anybody being sick. </sentence><sentence id="1274">So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population there. </sentence><sentence id="1275">So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the <span class="building">infirmary</span>, chances are you'd  0 never come back, or if you were too filthy. </sentence><sentence id="1276">We decided we are going to keep clean, and we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: As I said, we broke up <span class="env feature">ice</span>, got into the <span class="env feature">water</span> and washed ourselves, and at night we used to dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing. </sentence><sentence id="1296">I think we were the only ones who did that. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the night, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I used to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one <span class="region">area</span> to another because we finished one to dig those <span class="dlf">trenches</span> in another <span class="region">area</span>, then we were moved to another <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And you could see <span class="building">homes</span> not too far away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I used to run out and go to the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1301">They used to give me some bread. </sentence><sentence id="1302">At first I used to fill myself up with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread, and I used to bring the bread to my four buddies. </sentence></p></dialogue>

wasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And they started taking us from <span class="populated place">village</span> to <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1396">We stopped in a <span class="building">bar</span> at every <span class="populated place">village</span>, and they kept on losing people on the way, especially people who didn't have shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I happened to have a good pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible experiences of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I don't know if he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet. </sentence><sentence id="1403">It was cold. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1404">It was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1405">It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And we kept on

</sentence><sentence id="1409">They stopped in <span class="populated place">villages</span>, the names that I happen to have, and one day one of the women who were part of my group said to me, "Why don't I try to go out and see," -- it was after the third <span class="populated place">village</span> -- "to see if I can get some bread for us. </sentence><sentence id="1410">You always are the one

id="1420">I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end. </sentence><sentence id="1421">You don't walk out barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Now, I just want to tell you about human nature. </sentence><sentence id="1423">In the one of the <span class="building">tents</span> where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked person, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1424">One of those,  2 you know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1425">She was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that. </sentence><sentence id="1426">She was a very disliked individual. </sentence><sentence

on my shoes, and I kept on walking. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Eventually we wound up in the , which was the last <span class="populated place">village</span> of this "death march." </sentence><sentence id="1439">By then they knew, the Germans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They put us in a <span class="building">barn</span> and that was really -- that was real hell because everybody was dying. </sentence><sentence id="1441">I wouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and the stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Every place you sat next to a corpse. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1443">And one of my

</sentence><sentence id="1448">And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was make us dig deep <span class="dlf">ditches</span> because they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And I dropped the mother on a pile of bones. </sentence><sentence id="1450">And I went back -- I went back to this <span class="building">barn</span> and surrounded by death, except my two friends. </sentence><sentence id="1451">One escaped, two escaped on the way. </sentence><sentence id="1452">The one with the shoes and the other one kind of also, she escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1453">So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding on to each other and suddenly we hear voices. </sentence><sentence id="1454">They closed the <span class="dlf">barn doors</span>, it was like 10:00. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="1456">It was 10:00. </sentence><sentence id="1457">They closed all the <span class="dlf">doors</span> of the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1458">They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were going to burn the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1459">The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing, we hear bagging on our <span class="dlf">barn doors</span> and Russian spoken. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And they opened up the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and of course, the ones who could, walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1461">I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And my friend, my two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I said, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1581">A: For the Russians, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send us -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to <span class="country">Russia</span>, not <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1583">They'll send us to <span class="country">Russia</span> someplace on one of those <span class="dlf">farms</span>, and I decided I'm not going there. </sentence><sentence id="1584">So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1585">There was a guard watching the <span class="region">area</span> where the <span class="building">buildings</span> where we were actually housed, Russian stayed there and people who worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1586">And they had a guard and a <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and you just had to announce before you go. </sentence><sentence id="1587">There was a curfew there. </sentence><sentence id="1588">You couldn't leave just whenever you felt like it. </sentence><sentence id="1589">But my <span class="dlf">window</span> faced the outside, so I threw whatever a small bundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I told him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1590">So, I went. </sentence><sentence id="1591">I picked up my little bundle, and I ran to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were going anyplace, no matter where you wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And I really didn't know where I was going to go. </sentence><sentence id="1594">I said I wanted to go <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And I got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they said they come from <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, and they heard that in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> there is an organization, an organization was established to find out who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1596">It's like what do you call those <span class="building">centers</span>, where everybody sends their family -- but it's a <span class="building">center</span> for all survivors so they can find people whoever tells them who they were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1597">There was no mail. </sentence><sentence id="1598">I mean it was really only word by mouth, really. </sentence><sentence id="1599">I said okay, I'll go to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1600">So we arrived in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a place to sleep over, and I didn't particularly care for that. </sentence><sentence id="1601">So, when I got out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I decided to make it fast, and they yelled, "we fed you with chocolate." </sentence><sentence id="1602">They gave me chocolate, that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And I went away, and I got on a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> at 6:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1604">My Polish was kind of rusty, so I asked the driver where is the <span class="building">Jewish center</span>, and he said, "I'll take you there." </sentence><sentence id="1605">So, I arrived there, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told them I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there. </sentence><sentence id="1606">So, that is where I wound up. </sentence><sentence id="1607">I was bald then because we were all shaven. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And I was wearing a turban usually. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> in the <span class="dlf">common area</span> where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> in some kind of makeshift <span class="spatial object">sleeping bags</span>, and I removed my turban. </sentence><sentence id="1610">I needed some fresh air, and I walked out in the <span class="interior space">hall</span> to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1611">So, he even met me without my turban. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was going to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1648">I figured what the heck, I speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="1649">I don't have anybody any other place in the world so I might as well go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1650">And they would have sent me awfully quickly because many <span class="country">Lithuania</span> young people in "37 and "38, and I figured I would try a nota , but I will try it, and then I will take it from there. </sentence><sentence id="1651">And then my Prince Charming appeared, and it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And then we came to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1653">We decided we were going to start our lives all over again. </sentence><sentence id="1654">It's no use living in the past because we had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1655">The world had gone mad so what should we do. </sentence><sentence id="1656">It could have happened to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1657">So we're not going to let that ruin us and bring up our children with <span class="building">complexes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1658">They probably have other <span class="building">complexes</span>, but certainly we didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is terrible, because there are some decent people in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1659">It was just a terrible experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1695">Q: Well, I'm wondering did you wish you weren't Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="1696">Did you feel more Jewish than ever? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1699">A: No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever. </sentence><sentence id="1700">I'm going to tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="1701">I don't if it has something to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="1702">We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And our son married a catholic young woman from <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And my friends were telling me -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1705">How can you take it? </sentence><sentence id="1706">How can you live with it? </sentence><sentence id="1707">I went to my rabbi and had a long conversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1708">She's a nice woman. </sentence><sentence id="1709">That's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am? </sentence><sentence id="1710">Emotionally I don't think I can take it but I'll probably take it. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know the more we have on our side, the better off we are. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So, that is my philosophy in life. </sentence><sentence id="1713">The  6 more people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not having something like that happen again. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Because he was a madman and all his <span class="country">nation</span> went mad. </sentence><sentence id="1715">I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="1716">I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of them said they didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1717">How could they not know about it, and how couldn't they foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out. </sentence><sentence id="1718">But it's terrible that people in power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any remorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you. </sentence><sentence id="1719">So, I can't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1720">I didn't think about it much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1745">A: I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it. </sentence><sentence id="1746">So, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here. </sentence><sentence id="1747">I knew I'd have to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great grandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us -- although they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always answered them what they asked. </sentence><sentence id="1748">We never gave them more information. </sentence><sentence id="1749">But now at least they can go to the <span class="building">museum</span> and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want to. </sentence><sentence id="1750">If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1751">That's all we want them to be, and I thank you for coming. </sentence><sentence id="1752">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview   </sentence></p></dialogue>
