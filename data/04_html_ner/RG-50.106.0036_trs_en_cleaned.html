<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: The time I was born, my father was running a <span class="building">liquor store</span> and we were living in the back of the <span class="building">store</span>, and when I was about 5 years old my parents sold the <span class="building">store</span>, and they moved into a <span class="building">building</span> which was originally owned by my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="4">And they left one third of that <span class="building">building</span> to me and two thirds to two of their sons. </sentence><sentence id="5">And we lived there when I was 5 years old on. </sentence><sentence id="6">My earliest memory, I would like to talk about that just before I was going to <span class="building">grade school</span>, one of my friends in the <span class="building">building</span> said, oh, I know someone who will go to the same class as you do, but he will never talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="7">I said, why not? </sentence><sentence id="8">Said his father is an officer in the army, and they wouldn't talk to a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="9">And this came really as a shock to me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="10">I didn't know that why anybody wouldn't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="11">So this is my earliest recollection that it was something wrong to be a Jew in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">And even when I went to <span class="building">school</span>, I found that person, and he never, ever said a word to me. </sentence><sentence id="13">And somehow I had the feeling that when somebody is an army officer, it might be a danger to me. </sentence><sentence id="14">Then I didn't really have too much trouble with my other classmates in <span class="building">school</span>, but when we started to go to different to learn religion, which was everybody had to take religion in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
