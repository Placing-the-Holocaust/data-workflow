<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Masha Loen. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, 1930. </sentence><sentence id="7">I lived near <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> in a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> called <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="8">I came from an average <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">In Yiddish they would say <span class="building">Balle Batish</span>, middle class. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was a good tailor, maybe would have called a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older sister than I am. </sentence><sentence id="11">We were four girls. </sentence><sentence id="12">One of them was born in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">There was only three girls before the war, and no boys. </sentence><sentence id="14">And what I can tell about my childhood...I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">I went to <span class="building">private school</span>, called <span class="building">Kommerz Gymnasium</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="16">I was thrown out of <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said something to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the <span class="spatial object">desk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">On accident I think it hit her nose. </sentence><sentence id="19">So my grandfather pushed me into a <span class="building">private school</span> somehow and I enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="20">I went to <span class="building">school</span> everyday by <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">We came back. </sentence><sentence id="22">We came back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">We played games. </sentence><sentence id="24">We played <span class="spatial object">soccer ball</span> they called in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and we made Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="25">That was the main sport of <span class="country">Lithuania</span> in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything was going on just as it is till 1940, when the Russians came in first to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">They gave us <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, the <span class="populated place">capital</span> back and at that time when I was in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, a lot...we had some refugees from <span class="country">Austria</span> and from <span class="country">Poland</span> that had relatives in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> so they came and we helped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the name of Levine, Anna Levine. </sentence><sentence id="27">I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="28">My grandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a <span class="spatial object">bicyclet</span>, you know, a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> for my girlfriend Anna. </sentence><sentence id="29">He said you know, <span class="building">Maraska</span> (ph), I can't afford to buy her a new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and put on a <span class="spatial object">net</span> in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and she was a beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="30">A very well-behaved child. </sentence><sentence id="31">My mother loved her very much because she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="32">I absolute don't know. </sentence><sentence id="33">I lost touch with her when I went into <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because I had so much on my mind. </sentence><sentence id="34">When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that is four and a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she said run, 01:04: because I'm running. </sentence><sentence id="35">And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we ran. </sentence><sentence id="36">My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven  very quietly back into <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and I lived in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span> and what I can tell you is it it happened to me I an experience today that with that . </sentence><sentence id="37">I, we walked into our  whatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you know, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was scrubbing the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and said get out 01:10: of my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the shotguns and pushed us out of the <span class="building">house</span> and at that time my father, like I said, he was a better tailor...worked for Jordan of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...at that time he was the head of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the Lebensschein. </sentence><sentence id="38">And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> in a little <span class="spatial object">basket</span> and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the  was called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. </sentence><sentence id="39">And they went from <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="building">home</span> and they told everybody please leave your sick ones at <span class="building">home</span> and <span class="country">Jordan</span> wants to hold a speech. </sentence><sentence id="40">We want you on this and this <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">Leave your sick ones <span class="building">home</span> and everybody has to be at this and this time on that <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that my aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on his face and we didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="43">He came with us. </sentence><sentence id="44">Some of my aunts were separated. </sentence><sentence id="45">My mother's sister that we lived in the same <span class="building">house</span> was separated from us, but my father's brother and my father's brother that was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> kept yelling at my father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and he worked with him in the <span class="building">Jordan Brigade</span> as a tailor, so we came and we came on that big <span class="dlf">field</span> and they start sorting and <span class="country">Jordan</span> never showed up. </sentence><sentence id="46">They surrounded us with machine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. </sentence><sentence id="47">And Hessel, I think it was Hessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="48">He was the right hand of <span class="country">Jordan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother tailor. </sentence><sentence id="50">Take your family and go. </sentence><sentence id="51">So my father started looking for people...you know for family, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him. </sentence><sentence id="52">He says oh, he had a toothache. </sentence><sentence id="53">It will be pulled out, and my father saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were behind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll never forget...and they said all this is your family? </sentence><sentence id="54">And my father saved a lot of strangers and we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. </sentence><sentence id="55">A lot of people went away to the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span>, and what the most terrible thing about the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span> or the <span class="building">Seventh Fort</span> was in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. </sentence><sentence id="56">The machine guns were going "t-t-t-t-t-t-t" and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now I found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">They were shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open <span class="dlf">graves</span> and then they would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten thousand people to shoot into the <span class="dlf">graves</span>, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and everything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. </sentence><sentence id="58">Some of them got themselves out and came back into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what they called <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> and they called <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in other <span class="populated place">death camps</span>...that why when I talk about the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> I don't talk it as a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">I talk it as the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">I talk about <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> as the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, because we did have portable <span class="building">crematoriums</span> in the <span class="populated place">Ninth Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">We did have <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="populated place">Seventh Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">They didn't have to have the <span class="spatial object">oven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">They just shot them in. </sentence><sentence id="64">At that time they still had bullets. </sentence><sentence id="65">They shot them in and then burned them. </sentence><sentence id="66">So if they can call a <span class="building">portable crematorium</span> why couldn't we call the <span class="building">portable crematorium</span> on  <span class="building">portable crematorium</span>...you couldn't call this a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">You called this a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, and then we were sent to the <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now I want to tell you one story that I always talk about and that's the children aktion. </sentence><sentence id="69">The children...1 was working in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> with a broken leg, but that's alright. </sentence><sentence id="70">Everything happens that should happen. </sentence><sentence id="71">I came to my father. </sentence><sentence id="72">You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the <span class="building">ghetto works</span> and my father was working in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">You know, you would trade some things for some food and the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and would share. </sentence><sentence id="74">My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. </sentence><sentence id="75">My father shared it with his family. </sentence><sentence id="76">So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, they had a separate <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">They had a <span class="dlf">window</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and everything was...they had it better than anybody. </sentence><sentence id="78">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works but it still was not in to <span class="populated place">town</span>, so that day in, very early in the morning, there's a . </sentence><sentence id="79">You know what...I would like to go out into <span class="populated place">town</span>, in a <span class="building">brigade</span> I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point that the kids are starving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="80">And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know, we did our best. </sentence><sentence id="81">And he said you know what...I said you have protection. </sentence><sentence id="82">You go in. </sentence><sentence id="83">You talk to the <span class="building">Arbeitsamt</span>, to the <span class="building">Komitet</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, so he went in and it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know, Herr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a <span class="building">house</span>...would you daughter be happy to do that? </sentence><sentence id="84">He said my daughter would be very happy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works...we saw some <span class="spatial object">black machines</span> coming into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> but no <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">Just painted little white <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. </sentence><sentence id="87">There's something rotten in <span class="populated place">Den</span>...I didn't know about <span class="country">Denmark</span>...I was too young to know about, you know, <span class="populated place">Hamlet</span> or whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="88">Why are those <span class="spatial object">machines</span> coming in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some  same German when we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="90">There was different Germans, completely different, and something is very quiet on that <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> isn't moving. </sentence><sentence id="92">Everything was like in slow motion. </sentence><sentence id="93">And I and a man that was with the <span class="building">Arbeitsamt</span>, the uncle Jankele Goldovsky comes out from behind that <span class="building">booth</span> near the <span class="dlf">gate</span> where the Germans were standing. </sentence><sentence id="94">He said, girls, you came at the worst time. </sentence><sentence id="95">It's twelve-thirty. </sentence><sentence id="96">They are taking away all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota. </sentence><sentence id="97">They're taking everybody. </sentence><sentence id="98">And as we walk out from that <span class="building">booth</span>, we saw about four White Russians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">It went through, all through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, that <span class="dlf">street</span> where the, where the <span class="dlf">gate</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="100">And they surrounded us. </sentence><sentence id="101">They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked by that little <span class="building">Kommandatur</span>, our little <span class="building">houses</span>, and I know...oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="102">My mother is at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="104">My mother is at <span class="building">home</span> with the two kids. </sentence><sentence id="105">What can I do? </sentence><sentence id="106">Shall I run? </sentence><sentence id="107">Shall I make a run for it? </sentence><sentence id="108">Go see what happened?And from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. </sentence><sentence id="109">I didn't know what happened to me, and the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as  know you have two little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="110">Tell me where they are. </sentence><sentence id="111">I'll go and help you. </sentence><sentence id="112">And you know, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind start working. </sentence><sentence id="113">I said oh no. </sentence><sentence id="114">He's wearing a German uniform. </sentence><sentence id="115">He's having a gun. </sentence><sentence id="116">Even if I I tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. </sentence><sentence id="117">I'm grown up. </sentence><sentence id="118">I have my own place. </sentence><sentence id="119">He said you never told me that. </sentence><sentence id="120">He said would you like to see your father? </sentence><sentence id="121">I said, yes, very much. </sentence><sentence id="122">And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends are dragging me back into the other <span class="region">side</span>, and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose. </sentence><sentence id="123">My mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="124">I want to see my father. </sentence><sentence id="125">and . </sentence><sentence id="126">And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine  realize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that time. </sentence><sentence id="127">And she had a little <span class="dlf">hole</span> that she saw this <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">She saw those mothers taking the kids to the, to those to those <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">And people dragging them and the mothers, they didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she saved my two little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="130">Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. </sentence><sentence id="131">She was a beautiful lady. </sentence><sentence id="132">Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. </sentence><sentence id="133">It's going to go on again. </sentence><sentence id="134">So I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works on my papers. </sentence><sentence id="135">She said no, you go with your poppa. </sentence><sentence id="136">You're going to be missed and there's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the children up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two little sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two little sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a very young woman. </sentence><sentence id="137">Because when we were, when the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated and we were sent into the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, they separated her with the two kids and they took her away. </sentence><sentence id="138">At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a <span class="building">crematorium</span> means. </sentence><sentence id="139">I didn't even know what a <span class="building">crematorium</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="140">I know one thing is that when they were still alive and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. </sentence><sentence id="141">Don't forget one was born in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">My little sister Rosale never knew 01:34: what it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. </sentence><sentence id="143">And what we did is, those new <span class="building">apartments</span>...they made the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller again and we had to move the kids, so the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was left over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put lipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped through because we were not far, like I told you, for the <span class="building">German Kommandatur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">So what happened is every time they made the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller, we had to move them, and the little one was so smart. </sentence><sentence id="145">She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and what she did is, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and when she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and  very upset with her. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were sitting at the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">She just came back from taking them clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I understood Russian. </sentence><sentence id="148">I spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="149">And she said, you know, those people are exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="150">Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. </sentence><sentence id="151">And you know, at, as we were dri...driving into <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> in those little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and she said, let's go where everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and I was feeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it because a lot of us didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="152">Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="153">A lot of people of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father would bring some food from the Jordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. </sentence><sentence id="154">Then she would take it from us and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away from Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little piece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything went but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the movie, , that they show the <span class="spatial object">gynecologist table</span> with all the dirt and filth. </sentence><sentence id="156">I wrote to  0 still and SS and he goes through the <span class="dlf">lines</span> like this, like a maniac. </sentence><sentence id="157">I'll never forget, and he said, "Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste" you black devil are going to be some kind of a post of some kind of clean the latrine or stubenaeltester, you know, the head of the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. </sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know where my mother is. </sentence><sentence id="160">With the kids I don't know what's happening here. </sentence><sentence id="161">See, I went ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="162">I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said: "was". </sentence><sentence id="163">Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the <span class="building">barrack</span> with my head, and I start bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="164">As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="165">Why is that man doing it to me? </sentence><sentence id="166">What are those people all around me doing shivering in in striped uniform? </sentence><sentence id="167">Where am I? </sentence><sentence id="168">Where is my mother? </sentence><sentence id="169">All of a sudden I turned thirteen again. </sentence><sentence id="170">What is happening to me? </sentence><sentence id="171">And I looked at him with my two black eyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="172">I didn't move. </sentence><sentence id="173">The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="174">And that sadist that didn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. </sentence><sentence id="175">That's what saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="176">Every time he came into the <span class="building">barrack</span> to beat up the women, every time we were standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that we got. </sentence><sentence id="177">He never touched me. </sentence><sentence id="178">I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="179">Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. </sentence><sentence id="180">He thought I was supernatural. </sentence><sentence id="181">How can I get help? </sentence><sentence id="182">How can I heal with a big cut like that and how can I look him straight in the face without crying. </sentence><sentence id="183">That means I didn't hurt. </sentence><sentence id="184">I was supernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. </sentence><sentence id="185">And that's what saved my life in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one side, that he was drunk...other people did it. </sentence><sentence id="186">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="187">So we went and they put three <span class="spatial object">boats</span> to go out to those little <span class="populated place">camps</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="188">And I was
