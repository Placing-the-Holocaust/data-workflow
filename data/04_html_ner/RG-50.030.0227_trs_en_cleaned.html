<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q:Can you pause a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q:Uh Paul, tell us what it was like in <span class="populated place">Tren_in</span> from 1940, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="142">You have described what was happening to your family, but I'd like to know a little bit more about what was happening in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, what life was like for you as a young man during that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A:Well, my life was revolving around uh the <span class="building">school</span> and <span class="building">HaShomer HaTzair</span> and uh as 1940 came to pass, uh there were restrictions where you could go for instance. </sentence><sentence id="146">There were certain places where we could not go hiking anymore. </sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, you couldn't go to <span class="building">movies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">By 1940 the <span class="spatial object">radios</span> were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="149">Um... by 1941 you couldn't have a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">Uh by uh early 1941 the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> had to collapse itself, all of its grades, into a small <span class="interior space">classroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">I mean there was continual, almost monthly, new regulation and proscriptions and prescriptions of what you could or couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh by 1941 you had to wear a yellow star, and that meant that when you walked down the <span class="dlf">street</span> uh when the local ruffians wanted to beat you up, uh they just beat you up. </sentence><sentence id="153">Of course that led to the fact that we always went together as crowd. </sentence><sentence id="154">I mean there were no rough tactics like using knives or anything like that...it was just uh sticks and fists. </sentence><sentence id="155">So, you know, 1940, 1941 uh was conversion of <span class="building">HaShomer HaTzair</span> into sort of a youth gang. </sentence><sentence id="156">Uh from a childhood This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="157">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="158"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection standpoint actually, uh it was a wonderful experience. </sentence><sentence id="159">It sort of made things very intense and very important, and suddenly things became just very very ... things which you would not have believed were important became very important. </sentence><sentence id="160">For instance uh most of the Jews had to get rid of their books. </sentence><sentence id="161">You were not allowed to have books. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean there's lots of things...you couldn't have this, this and that, so the notion that you could read a book, or that somebody owned a book, was a matter of great importance because if you could borrow a book uh and you had a book or you had access to somebody who borrowed your book, that was subject of very very much conversation--who reads what. </sentence><sentence id="163">It became a very intense kind of a life..-uh life became very precious. </sentence><sentence id="164">Uh so so I'm not looking at that period in fact uh with with dismay. </sentence><sentence id="165">It became a very very intensive life where every moment mattered and everything mattered, and you became very cautious and very very forward looking, very calculating, and very well organized, so.... Of course by the end of 1940 or early in 1941, the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> was dissolved. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh, it just happened that my father arranged for some people, and and there were some refugees, to to start tutoring me at <span class="building">home</span>; so starting in 1941, I had private tutors including some very distinguished uh people who otherwise would have, I would never have met in terms of education. </sentence><sentence id="167">Uh I started studying English in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="168">I had an excellent uh English teacher from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">| didn't have a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">We were not allowed to have a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, but uh the local music teacher who was the wife of a local judge let me practice on her <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">It it's that sort of experiences ... they are they are sort of savoring life and savoring experiences. </sentence><sentence id="172">Uh, you know, sure I got beaten up, but we also beat up some of them too, I mean, so uh we learned how to do dirty fighting and kicking. </sentence><sentence id="173">Uh we did not always run. </sentence><sentence id="174">Most of the time we did. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh and the relationship between the the the young people, I mean the people with whom I was in those days uh...I mean and and one of them is in <span class="country">Sweden</span>, one of them is in <span class="country">Israel</span>, one of them is in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, and they're all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="176">I can pick up the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> and talk to them like I can talk to nobody. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh, a few months ago one of these boys who was with me uh wrote me a letter and in the letter he just mentioned that he has This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="178">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="179"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection tremendous headaches and uh that uh the doctors in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> can't find out what's wrong with him, so I get the letter uh in the morning, I call up uh the other boy who was part of the group in <span class="populated place">Goteborg</span>, <span class="country">Sweden</span>, and I said, uh, Sano has headaches. </sentence><sentence id="180">If I send him by <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> tomorrow morning to <span class="populated place">Goteborg</span> can you take care...can you take him to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="181">He said of course. </sentence><sentence id="182">You know, it's like, you know, you know, like like continuing the same conversation of fifty years ago. </sentence><sentence id="183">I pick up the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">I call <span class="populated place">Sano</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span>, I said there is a ticket waiting for you. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh you just walk down the <span class="dlf">street</span> and the <span class="building">travel agency</span> and hop on the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> and Francl will pick you up at the <span class="building">airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Now he hasn't seen <span class="populated place">Francl</span> in fifty years, but, you know, it was just...it's that kind of a relationship. </sentence><sentence id="187">I, I don't have with nobody...I, I wouldn't pick up a <span class="spatial object">phone</span> like that with anybody else except my nearest family or my children, so you know, coming back to the forties and you want to get the spirit...it's, it's life of great intensity. </sentence><sentence id="188">It's life of great, uh, changing of outlook. </sentence><sentence id="189">Things become very precious, very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q:And uh the noose then begins to tighten. </sentence><sentence id="240">What happens.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A:And as the noose becomes tightened, of course, then uh, you know, when the deportations start and this this is very ugly, uh but it's very bureaucratized. </sentence><sentence id="244">You know, the lists are made up, and, and, and in fact the the Jewish council administers the list, so the the Gestapo has just a few people. </sentence><sentence id="245">Then they have the Hlinka Guards, the quislings, and then you have the local gendarmes, and the whole thing is organized as a <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, and the <span class="spatial object">machine</span> uh because of its bureaucratic approach, becomes predictable which means that if you're skillful and if you have pull, uh you can anticipate the motions and then you can almost figure out the odds of survival and so life becomes on the part of my father very much preoccupied with understanding which way the laws are going and what do you give up in order to protect, so in 1942 when the uh deportations begin, my father is uh advised that, "Yes, we can protect you but if you would get baptized uh it would look This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="246">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="247"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection better because it would allow us to reclassify you from column 4BC to column 4DA which is a different priority." </sentence><sentence id="248">See, by that time uh the whole question of destruction becomes an arithmetic calculation. </sentence><sentence id="249">Who owes what favor to whom, what can you do to protect. </sentence><sentence id="250">And by the way, that is the sort of mentality that continues afterwards under the communist regime. </sentence><sentence id="251">It it is not just a Holocaust experience. </sentence><sentence id="252">It is a totalitarian experience. </sentence><sentence id="253">It's a Kafka's, Kafka-like experience, except it's accentuated because now the game becomes deadly, so my father said fine. </sentence><sentence id="254">OK. </sentence><sentence id="255">You know, you want to reclassify. </sentence><sentence id="256">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="257">We get baptized. </sentence><sentence id="258">I just got bar mitzvah in January "42, so then Father comes back and said you know, and we have to get baptized. </sentence><sentence id="259">Fine Dad. </sentence><sentence id="260">You know, how do we do that?Well, you know, uh we have to sort of get the thing organized and you have to qualify. </sentence><sentence id="261">We cannot get you into the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span> because it takes too long and it requires Archbishop dispensation and it would take a couple of years, but uh you can get baptized in the <span class="building">Evangelic Church</span>, which was a <span class="building">Protestant church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and the Protestants are more flexible because of the heritage and we can do the whole thing in eight months and you have to go to <span class="building">school</span> and learn the catechism and so forth, so part of the experience is one of how to survive in a <span class="region">totalitarian environment</span>, how to adapt, how to change your skins, your habits, your behavior, because that is what the rules require. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q:How did you go about it? </sentence><sentence id="287">How did this process of becoming ___ educated to become baptized, how did it... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A:Oh there is a procedure for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q:I know. </sentence><sentence id="293">But how did...yes, I understand that. </sentence><sentence id="294">What I want to know is what did Paul Strassman do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A:Early "44 the quisling army, the two divisions that fight for the for the, uh, Slovak quisling government, uh, makes a deal with the <span class="populated place">London</span> government [NB: the Czechoslovak government in exile] and the idea is that when the time comes to, uh, for the Russians to cross over the <span class="env feature">Carpathian mountains</span>, uh, that government will come in, the Slovak army will attack the Germans in the <span class="dlf">mountain passes</span> from the rear, hold ground until the army can come over and uh that's how it would be. </sentence><sentence id="928">We will liberate <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="929">Uh, the deal is made, uh, in May, but that's when the news comes out what happened in <span class="country">Poland</span>."! </sentence><sentence id="930">As you know...again it was a western inspired, western led uprising that uh led to the Russians stopping at the <span class="dlf">Visla</span> [NB: <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>], and letting the Germans wipe them out. </sentence><sentence id="931">So another meeting takes place and the idea now is to make a deal with the communists, who also have an army running under the Soviet command from the <span class="region">east</span>, and say we are going to make this join and in order to cooperate with the with the uh Soviets we are going to put the communists in charge and so late in May a meeting is held where the communists are going to go <span class="populated place">Kiev</span> where the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the uh Russian army is headed by a man by the name of Krushchev, Nikita Krushchev [NB: at this time, acting as Commissar of the Soviet partisans], and the timing of the Russian attacking is the <span class="dlf">mountain pass</span> and the communist leadership now of the <span class="building">Slovak underground</span> will be coordinated so we don't have a situation like in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">Turns out the communists don't keep their part of the deal. </sentence><sentence id="933">They actually never communicate with the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="934">The communists were totally " The <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> Revolt began in early August 1944.This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="935">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="936"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into <span class="country">Slovakia</span> and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody, stopped the <span class="spatial object">night train</span> that goes from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Bucharest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="937">Just happens on that <span class="spatial object">train</span> are twenty-eight German generals. </sentence><sentence id="938">Line them up on the <span class="building">railroad station</span> in <span class="populated place">Ru_omberok</span> and shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="939">The following day uh my father says "OK. </sentence><sentence id="940">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="941">We are going to go into our escape plan. </sentence><sentence id="942">We are going to execute our escape plan. </sentence><sentence id="943">We are going to disperse," and so that morning which is the 28th of uh 27th of August, 1944, uh we go and we get dropped off in the various <span class="populated place">villages</span> and we stay there. </sentence><sentence id="944">Well it turns out that the Germans are a little slow to react. </sentence><sentence id="945">They take some retaliatory action which is local but there is no Sonderkommando, not anything. </sentence><sentence id="946">And also the uh the <span class="building">base</span> which is the <span class="building">business</span>, it still has to be run and so after two days in our locations, uh my uh my father is told uh look, you better come back. </sentence><sentence id="947">This is...you jumped the gun a little. </sentence><sentence id="948">You...it's premature. </sentence><sentence id="949">So the whole family retrieves from the pre-staged hiding places and we go back where we were. </sentence><sentence id="950">OK. </sentence><sentence id="951">Now this is a fatal mistake. </sentence><sentence id="952">But it leads...it's it's part of really not understanding what was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="953">Uh and because of course the Russians are not crossing the <span class="env

class="country">Poland</span>, so <span class="country">Slovakia</span> is not even on the map of of being crossed. </sentence><sentence id="956">What the Germans meanwhile do is they just land <span

id="957">They successfully disarmed the <span class="region">eastern division</span>, which was the highly armed, which was the spear-head of this whole <span class="dlf">plot</span>.

starts between the the, uh, Slovak soldiers of the <span class="region">western division</span> and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="964">Uh, on the night of the 29th of August, uh, for reasons which I still don't understand, my father decided, "Why don't you sleep <span class="building">home</span> tonight and just why, why don't you go and sleep somewhere else so that the whole family's not together," although we are still in <span class="populated place">Tren_in</span>. </sentence><sentence id="965">And I go to sleep at a <span class="building">house</span> of a friend, uh, who was half-Jewish and they were workers and, and, and somehow...nobody every paid attention to them. </sentence><sentence id="966">I just slept there. </sentence><sentence id="967">Early in the morning I get the message during the night the Gestapo came and took twelve hostages, and my father was one of the hostages. </sentence><sentence id="968">They were...he was not taken as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="969">He was taken as the head operator. </sentence><sentence id="970">Subsequently in "45, I find out that my father was involved in shipping food, uh, into illegal <span class="spatial object">food caches</span> that were being already staged starting in May, so that when the army starts holding against the Germans there is food already in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> being staged for the for the uh for the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="971">So in the morning uh my father gets taken away. </sentence><sentence id="972">They were looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="973">All the males were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="974">I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="975">They just came in...they came in during the night. </sentence><sentence id="976">Again this was totally irregular. </sentence><sentence id="977">Whenever Jews were taken, you know, the <span class="building">local gendarmerie</span> came with the bureaucratic procedure, and there was a time to be warned. </sentence><sentence id="978">The Germans...there was no warning. </sentence><sentence id="979">They just took, uh, uh, some some people who are involved, uh, in in the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="980">They were taken as hostages, and so now, uh, the message comes for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="981">You know, I never see my mother again. </sentence><sentence id="982">Uh, we cannot go back to where we were before. </sentence><sentence id="983">We blew our cover. </sentence><sentence id="984">We go to a <span class="dlf">fallback position</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">In other words, there were two layers of places to go to and so I leave the <span class="building">house</span> where I was sleeping, with this friend, and go to an employee of my father who was in one of the <span class="populated place">villages</span> outside of of of <span class="populated place">Tren_in</span>. </sentence><sentence id="986">My sister goes to another place. </sentence><sentence id="987">My mother goes to another place. </sentence><sentence id="988">So the family gets dispersed. </sentence><sentence id="989">We go into what's called bunker mode, which is you go somewhere and you're going to be hidden somewhere in a <span class="interior space">closet</span> or something until the war blows over, but my father isn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="990">OK. </sentence><sentence id="991">My father This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

gets shipped with the uh uprising. </sentence><sentence id="995">Uh there's a whole group of people involved in the uprising who who gets uh who gets annihilated in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="996">So I go over to the <span class="building">house</span> of this this fallback, second position uh backup. </sentence><sentence id="997">And I'm there one night. </sentence><sentence id="998">In the morning the wife of this employee comes in all panicky. </sentence><sentence id="999">This employee had a young wife, recently married. </sentence><sentence id="1000">He was a much older man. </sentence><sentence id="1001">This was his second marriage. </sentence><sentence id="1002">The girl was sort of a floozy or whatever and uh she comes in all alarmed. </sentence><sentence id="1003">She's a new wife, and says, "Look...the Germans are doing <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> search," and by that time the Germans announced that "If we find any uh partisans, soldiers or Jews uh we are going to shoot them and also shoot every inhabitant in the <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1004">So the wife gets very alarmed and this newly married older guy goes to me and says, "Look, why don't you just go away for the day out to the to the to the <span class="env feature">river</span> where there are thrushes and <span class="env feature">bushes</span>...you know, it's it's fairly wooded and near the <span class="env feature">river</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1005">Throughout the <span class="dlf">valley</span> flows a <span class="env feature">river</span> by the name of <span class="env feature">Vah</span> and there are all kinds of hiding places. " </sentence><sentence id="1006">Why don't you stay there? </sentence><sentence id="1007">And uh then come back in the evening and we'll see how things go." </sentence><sentence id="1008">Now remember...I'm fifteen years old, so L..and oh...and I get a sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="1009">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I go in my sandals, in my short shoes, a shirt a belt and a sandwich, for the day at the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Now you also must understand that through all of this time I know the <span class="region">area</span> extremely well, and I'ma fabulous swimmer because we swim quite a bit in the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1012">It's a wild <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1013">It has it has it has uh <span class="env feature">rapids</span> too, and we swim through the <span class="env feature">rapids</span> and so forth, but you know...and it's it's part of the training and oh...we swim through the <span class="env feature">river</span> because we couldn't go to the only <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> there was in <span class="populated place">Tren_in</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Since 1940 Jews are not allowed to go to the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> so you learn how to swim through the <span class="env feature">river</span>, which is dangerous and full of <span class="env feature">rapids</span>, but it's fun. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I told you, you know, hardship creates fun too. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So I go to the <span class="env feature">river</span> and I sit there and during the day I see on the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> the <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> coming in and <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span> and the Germans are really moving in. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Now the Germans are coming in full force. </sentence><sentence id="1018">The army has basically abandoned the <span class="building">garrison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1019">There is

say well, they are shooting so that means that that's good news, because you know, if they're shooting there that means that there are some friends out there. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So about four o'clock in the afternoon I uh take off my shirt, take the sandals, tie them up on my head with my belt, and I go into the <span class="env feature">river</span> and I swim down the <span

know...we are put you in and uh then let's hop in the hop in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1092">We mount the machine gun on top of the <span class="spatial

shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1102">I say I don't even know how to load the thing, so they take me out and they say this is what you do and they show me how to how to shoot. </sentence><sentence

go on the first raid. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Now turns out that this was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me, because the army that fled and the communist government that got created,

are full of bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1123">You know, about eighty-five thousand people got killed in that that process. </sentence><sentence id="1124">So we go on the first raid I think on the

eight of us, a <span class="spatial object">machine gun</span>, uh lots of ammo. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Uh there are guys who are carrying the <span class="spatial object">TNT</span>...that's what we used, uh TNT. </sentence><sentence id="1129">It's it's it's more powerful than than than dynamite but it's not like plastique, and these are little uh <span class="spatial object">metal boxes</span> about this big, this wide and uh it's a real charming group. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Uh a <span class="building">commando squad</span> is a very unusual dynamics. </sentence><sentence id="1131">In other words, in no time everybody knows he is dependent on everybody, so I mean nobody says "I'm a Jew," or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1132">I mean it's just, you know, "Hey, kid. </sentence><sentence id="1133">You know, you going to walk ahead of us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1134">We we really need you." </sentence><sentence id="1135">And so I lead them through the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and uh we go further <span class="region">north</span> of <span class="populated place">Tren_in</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1136">See, below Tren_in the <span class="env feature">valley</span> widens and the <span class="dlf">railroad track</span> hugs the <span class="env feature">river</span> so

they don't want to see us and uh we go...starts raining. </sentence><sentence id="1142">We come to the edge, edge of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> early in the evening and we are just

"Batko" uh says "OK, let's go to the <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And why don't you come with us." </sentence><sentence id="1153">So three of us go down to the <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Why he took me, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1155">We go to the <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1156">We lay the <span class="spatial object">TNTs</span> right on to the <span class="dlf">rail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And the the the trick is in demolition...this is not what you see in movies, John Wayne movies...there is no way how you can carry enough ammo to blow up a <span class="spatial object">train</span> sky high. </sentence><sentence id="1158">To blow up a <span class="spatial object">train</span> sky high you would have to be on a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1159">You would have to know exactly where the <span class="dlf">bridge pins</span> are. </sentence><sentence id="1160">The <span class="dlf">bridges</span> were usually in <span class="region">populated areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1161">There was no way; and they were guarded and it was too risky. </sentence><sentence id="1162">The real trick is to get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> derail itself. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The way how you do it is you find a place where the <span class="dlf">track</span> is slightly on a <span class="dlf">curve</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1164">The way a <span class="spatial object">train</span> runs is that the it has flanges, sort of...in other words, the way, the reason a <span class="spatial object">train</span> doesn't derail is because the wheels are open on the outside but if pieces of steel going down so that the piece of steel always presses against the lip of the <span class="dlf">rail</span> and the trick then is to blow up the heaviest part of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, which is the <span class="spatial object">tender</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1165">In other words, the steam...these are <span class="spatial object">steam locomotives</span> by the ways...the heaviest part of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is where you have the <span class="env feature">water</span> and the coal, which is usually about fifteen meters behind the front of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I mean, these are standard-sized <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span> and the way "Batko" explains it all you have to do is knock out the <span class="dlf">rail</span> under the <span class="spatial object">tender</span>, the heavy part, and derail the <span class="spatial object">tender</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1167">The <span class="spatial object">tender</span> will tip over and pull the rest of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> down from the <span class="dlf">embankment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1168">So you know, this is an art form. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So far as "<span class="building">Batko</span>" is concerned, derailing <span class="spatial object">trains</span> is an art form. </sentence><sentence id="1170">The...and then he, of course, he is full of stories. </sentence><sentence id="1171">You know, as we sit there he tells me stories. </sentence><sentence id="1172">He is a very lively kind of a guy. </sentence><sentence id="1173">Uh again, the squad is eight people, three Russians and five Slovaks of whom four are communists (including one of them who fought in the Spanish civil war), so that's that's the squad and the guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War, it's it's a father and a son so there's father and son in the squad. </sentence><sentence id="1174">That's that's the makeup of the squad. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Get along very well. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And uh the idea then is to lay the TNT under the <span class="dlf">rail</span>, connect a fuse so that when the first wheel of the <span class="spatial object">steam engine</span> comes and crushes the fuse it will ignite the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 detonator. </sentence><sentence id="1179">OK? </sentence><sentence id="1180">And the detonator then will ignite a cord and the cord goes at the rate of one second every twenty centimeters, so that the speed of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is about forty miles an hour, thirty miles an hour, you need a cord approximately four feet long so that when the first <span class="spatial object">wheel</span> detonates the thing, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> will have passed approximately fifteen meters and it will blow right under the wheel of the <span class="spatial object">tender</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Again this is this is...now we're doing with professionals. </sentence><sentence id="1182">The problem with most of the partisans that existed and the stories that you hear about partisans...these were all amateurs. </sentence><sentence id="1183">This is this is this is killer stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Highly specialized. </sentence><sentence id="1185">So uh we lay the <span class="spatial object">TNT</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1186">We lay the fuse, but we don't put the fuse on top of the <span class="dlf">rail</span>, because we are going to do it only when we get a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1187">We don't want to blow up a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Uh and so that's how we do it for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Uh we know by sound how this thing works. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Uh we can tell a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="1191"><span class="populated place">Batko</span>" knows how to tell a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1192">We go back to the <span class="dlf">embankment</span> about midnight, maybe eleven o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1194">By that time it rains. </sentence><sentence id="1195">The <span class="dlf">field</span> that is between the <span class="dlf">embankment</span>...you know, it's only about two hundred meters but it's a it's a soggy <span class="dlf">field</span> and uh between the <span class="dlf">field</span> there is a <span class="dlf">path</span> which is beaten but everything else has been plowed. </sentence><sentence id="1196">I mean this is September. </sentence><sentence id="1197">This is a <span class="dlf">wheat field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1198">It has been plowed, and "Batko" says, "You just make sure that you're in there where the <span class="dlf">path</span> is." </sentence><sentence id="1199">So we go back up. </sentence><sentence id="1200">When the uh when when "Batko" says, "I've seen we've got a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>," and we go back up on the <span class="dlf">embankment</span> and we crouch against the <span class="dlf">embankment</span> and we wait until we see the lights of the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1201">You have to see the lights of the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span> because if the Germans have what's called a <span class="spatial object">draisienne</span> [NB: a <span class="spatial object">handcar</span>], which is a little <span class="dlf">platform</span> or a a little <span class="spatial object">armored car</span> ahead of it...they usually used to push a flat <span class="spatial object">car</span>...later by the way they had hostages on the on the <span class="spatial object">flat car</span> with them from the <span class="populated place">local villages</span> but this time they didn't...you want to make sure they don't blow up the uh <span class="spatial object">flat car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And of course this was still early, and I don't think on the first <span class="spatial object">train</span> the Germans expected anything. </sentence><sentence id="1203">You know, they used a <span class="spatial object">rail car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1204">This is the main <span class="dlf">rail line</span> between

three <span class="dlf">lines</span> that were going north-south were critical to the ability of the Germans to shift troops back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1208">They were running out of

you blow up that <span class="dlf">line</span>, usually it gets cleared up in about a half'a day. </sentence><sentence id="1211">The the objective...Yah, I mean you cannot disable the <span

it's it's a bee bite. </sentence><sentence id="1216">It's not deadly stuff, but that's what guerrilla warfare is all about. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So so uh we have to wait until we see the lights of the of the uh of the of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and as we go back to arm this thing, uh "Batko," who is going to do that, hands over to me the detonators.

think that the the two Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep with others because of food or whatever and so in November we got uh we joined a bigger group because we were going to move our

went after us, they pretended that they were Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1331">These were Vlasov ...these were the Vlasov guys, and so I got separated in November from the, from the squad.

away, and uh soaking wet uh we started marching east. </sentence><sentence id="1337">By that time we decided we are going to just move towards the front, and uh then I joined another brigade and then starting in December we started slowly fighting our way east. </sentence><sentence id="1338">I only went on one more raid in January, and by that time I had pleurisy and I was bleeding and...I was...after February I didn't fight anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1339">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I mean just could hardly walk. </sentence><sentence id="1341">Uh I crossed the

</sentence><sentence id="1346">Uh the Russians immediately got separated from us because they were all suspect of being collaborators, using the partisans purely as being a cover for them and there

</sentence><sentence id="1347">Uh early in uh March we also picked up five Americans fliers who were wandering through the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> who uh who had been shot down and
