<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well, that's what it was at that particular time, our returning back to <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> was used, since I had papers to be housed, and to be fed. </sentence><sentence id="69">So it was sort of used like vacationing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">After all, now we are free birds on ourselves. </sentence><sentence

that no foul things could happen towards me in that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="74">So, we all went to that particular time, I received my medals, well I -- well I already said, being on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and all of a sudden, I found myself that I'm going to work for the <span class="building">KGB</span>, which this was the farthest thing of my mind that I ever expected to happen. </sentence><sentence id="75">But I am the -- took soldiering before, when I escaped the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and I figured I'm continuing the same way.

person. </sentence><sentence id="81">However, when I came to <span class="populated place">Boronivitch</span>, which that was sort of the <span class="region">re-region</span> to where I was going to work, in that <span class="building">office</span> there, and I passed all the tests they wanted me to know, I told them that I wanted to go now for a little bit vacation with the two guys that they enlisted themselves in the militia, and not in the KGB, because their education was below mine, and therefore they wouldn't pass to go into the <span class="building">KGB</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">And I wanted to go back to their <span class="populated place">settlement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">Besides, I wanted, by any chance of all, maybe there was someone of my family, who by -- by any kind of way, survived, and if anything, probably that would be the place to meet them. </sentence><sentence id="84">On the other hand, I was separated from the partisans, the Jewish partisans, who were natives of <span class="populated place">Darechen</span> -- of that -- of that <span class="populated place">city</span> where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was that I escaped to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">I had my desire to go ahead to meet them, because we were separated, since I joined the other part, which it was in <span class="building">arvens</span>, which I mean the paratroopers, with the General kus -- with General Kustenko. </sentence><sentence id="86">So I was separated from all my past, sort of, in -- in spirit, as well as physically, and I was anxious to go there. </sentence><sentence id="87">So when I put it out that I want to go for two weeks, I was granted, and meaning granted at that particular time, you had to have a permit, otherwise, without a permit, you could have been arrested easily, and who knows where to -- you could wind up. </sentence><sentence id="88">So -- and I came to the <span class="building">house</span> of -- Volodya was the guy's name, and his cousin, and I was greeted like I would have been his brother, no | -- no less. </sentence><sentence id="89">His

just like a fantasy that you dream about, or stuff like this here. </sentence><sentence id="106">So I, again, was very mixed. </sentence><sentence id="107">I worked with him a whole week on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">It was potatoes they do, because at the time of year. </sentence><sentence id="109">It's September when we are talking about, and at that

because his mother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it. </sentence><sentence id="111">So in a way, I was a handy helper, hel -- helping hand there. </sentence><sentence id="112">And to me at that particular time, a certain fantasy got into my mind again, why would I want to continue as a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="113">And immediately I saw a -- a </sentence></p><p><sentence

of, in a way of speak. </sentence><sentence id="118">Look at it. </sentence><sentence id="119">We both for the war, he was against Nazism, he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to <span class="country">Germany</span>, to work with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="120">But look what had happened to the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="121">I had no one to come to, he comes back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">And he going and working, and coming at night, between meeting up with the boys and the girls. </sentence><sentence id="123">Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it the fantasy, because real, I was not looking for that. </sentence><sentence id="124">So I must call it a fantasy got into my mind, and that's what I thought, who knows? </sentence><sentence id="125">Maybe I'm going to get lost right now to these new world, and forget about the world that I lived in. </sentence><sentence id="126">And come Friday, the whole thing came to a change, whereupon Volodya says to me, "Harold, aren't you going to go to <span class="populated place">Darechen</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="127"><span class="populated place">Darechen</span> meaning the <span class="populated place">city</span> nearby -- not so nearby, but from where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="128">And he knew these partisans, these same guys from <span class="populated place">Darechen</span> fought together. </sentence><sentence id="129">Where he says to me, "Aren't you going to see your Jews, over there?" </sentence><sentence id="130">He all of a sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to myself, what happens Sunday now? </sentence><sentence id="131">Their <span class="building">church</span> was still on over there, it was not destroyed, and what if he asks me -- I go with him on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and work with him together. </sentence><sentence id="132">I associate in the same groups of people. </sentence><sentence id="133">What will it be, how will I feel if I'm asked to go to the <span class="building">church</span> with him together? </sentence><sentence id="134">And I did not know at the moment, so when he start talking about, and using that word, you Jews, instead of using the word, aren't you going go see our friends, the partisans, over in <span class="populated place">Darechen</span>? </sentence><sentence id="135">You know what I mean, or maybe naming someone? </sentence><sentence id="136">But he said you Jews. </sentence><sentence id="137">So I felt a separation going on, and I -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="138"> This is a verbatim

says, "Wait a minute now, I cannot hide myself." </sentence><sentence id="142">Oh, I cannot run away, because each sort of day is something that it isn't totally open. </sentence><sentence id="143">And I immediately said to him, "Of course I want to see, but you know how we worked every day long hours, and hard work, how was I to disrupt you and me from that work, and ask you about going to <span class="populated place">Darechen</span>? </sentence><sentence id="144">But since you don't plan on working perhaps tomorrow," because Saturday -- I did not observe S-Saturday, so anything like that at that time, because under the Soviets, religion was another part of life that you did not practice. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I said to him, "If time permits you, I will be very happy that you give it to me, and I will also ask you to please let me go to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q:

involved with all of these here things, on every occasion daneech, even though, at the time when I raised little children -- I took, in 1953, as I -- I don't know, I believe I forementioned it, the

things. </sentence><sentence id="1591">So that's what it was, my part. </sentence><sentence id="1592">I only wanted to put up as good of my memory as I remembered what I went through.
