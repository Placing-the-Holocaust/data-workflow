<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: What year was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: It was in "38 to "39. </sentence><sentence id="73">I remember being--just coming in, and then suddenly they would, they would attack bearded Jews in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and then if they saw somebody that they thought lived in that <span class="region">area</span>, they would just beat them up, too. </sentence><sentence id="74">And that happened. </sentence><sentence id="75">That's about all, but there were a number of Zionist movements and even Revisionist* movements, so that the Jews had quite a free life there. </sentence><sentence id="76">The government had no discrimination, officially. </sentence><sentence id="77">Of course, if you wanted to have certain jobs, then there were discriminations, so, in general, I would say <span class="country">Belgium</span> had a certain enlightened attitude towards the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="78">We were not affected, other than by having those 10,000 refugees from <span class="country">Germany</span>, by what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> until May the 10th. </sentence><sentence id="79">When we woke up and <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> was bombed by the Germans and we discovered we were at war, we were invaded. </sentence><sentence id="80">It was very fast and the 13th or 14th of May they had already reached almost the <span class="env feature">sea</span>, the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81"><span class="country">Belgium</span> is very small and as you know, the king capitulated within a week, I think. </sentence><sentence id="82">Because we had a small <span class="building">hotel</span> right at the <span class="env feature">sea shore</span>, my father took a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> and just left everything in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and reached that place, but we stayed only there for one day, because we heard that the Germans had already occupied, were already reaching the <span class="env feature">sea</span>, and so we followed the flow of those thousands of refugees that clogged the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and occasionally were attacked by the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, you know, just came down, swooping down and machine-gunned the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="83">And I had a small-- my brother is 15 years younger, so I had him. </sentence><sentence id="84">He had whooping cough and I was just carrying him on my back and he was just having his spells on my back and vomiting on us. </sentence><sentence id="85">It was a terrible place because we used to be on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and then hide, jumping off the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and just going by foot. </sentence><sentence id="86">The French at first hadn't opened the, hadn't opened the <span class="dlf">border</span>, so we were camping there for I think two days without having food or anything and then suddenly they opened the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we could come down to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">Somehow I thought that--because everybody was going towards <span class="populated place">Arras</span> and the <span class="populated place">northern cities</span> near the <span class="dlf">border</span> because they hoped that they would get to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">We--my father--found some kind of a private <span class="spatial object">car</span> and they brought us down to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">And we found later on that most of those refugees who tried to go to <span class="populated place">Arras</span> were bombed at the <span class="building">station</span> and killed. </sentence><sentence id="90">He managed to get to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and we stayed there for one night when my father again heard that we had to register as refugees, especially if we weren't Belgian, and so he went to the police. </sentence><sentence id="91">There he--that's when he had--at first he was a very great admirer of the French, he thought they were--the French revolution was really the representatives of what a <span class="country">republic</span> should  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mean--and a freedom-loving republic. </sentence><sentence id="92">And that's when he had--the first time, he asked, and he said that we would like to stay in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> if we could, and the man said, "You dirty Jew," and hit him and said, "You better report tomorrow to the--" what they call the <span class="dlf">caserne de tourelles</span>,deg which is a <span class="building">military barracks</span>, where then we found that all the refugees were being channeled towards various parts of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">The second time that we realized how antisemitic actually police was, was in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">There were many refugees from all over, most Jews. </sentence><sentence id="95">And <span class="country">Italy</span> was then a <span class="country">Fascist country</span> and was just going into, was then entering the war. </sentence><sentence id="96">There was an Italian worker who was totally uneducated. </sentence><sentence id="97">The police was assigning to each <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, you know, a person in charge, and I say my father was the most educated person in that place and he was a really respectable-looking man, but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and uneducated and put him in charge because, he said it openly, "I'm not going to put any Jew in charge of a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>." </sentence><sentence id="98">So that was the thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How long were you in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Only 48 hours I think--72 hours. </sentence><sentence id="130">Because we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish refugees in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and so they evacuated and we went with other Belgian non-Jews into-- we ended up after a long ordeal on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and <span class="spatial object">buses</span> in <span class="region">central France</span>, in the <span class="region">Ardeche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">It's a small state, a small department, which the <span class="populated place">capital</span> had about 4,000 inhabitants and we ended up in a <span class="populated place">hamlet</span> where we stayed for three months over the summer. </sentence><sentence id="132">It was a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, I became a farm boy. </sentence><sentence id="133">As a matter of fact, I keep in touch with the farmer I met. </sentence><sentence id="134">I have been several times to this <span class="populated place">hamlet</span> 50 years later. </sentence><sentence id="135">He's still alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: How did you connect with the farmer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Oh, they put us up in a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">They put us up in a <span class="building">factory</span> that was--that only worked during the winter because they didn't have electricity and in the winter there was enough water to get the--to farm the--it was a silk, they were doing, something was just silk thread or something--and we were barracked there, at a <span class="populated place">village</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="147">And within a few--when in June we came there in May, the end of May. </sentence><sentence id="148">On June 18th, I think, <span class="country">France</span> capitulated and Petain(r) took over. </sentence><sentence id="149">The Belgian refugees who were non-Jewish were repatriated. </sentence><sentence id="150">There was also another Jewish family who also was--chose to go back to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">The reason why is because rumor spreads very quickly that there were <span class="populated place">camps</span> all over <span class="country">France</span>, especially near the <span class="env feature">Pyrenees</span>, <span class="populated place">Saint-Cyprien</span>, <span class="populated place">Anjouleme</span>, Corse, where the conditions were extremely difficult, and they said they were very harsh towards the Jews in particular, and so we heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="152">And as a matter of fact, we heard that the oldest sister of my mother, her husband, her daughter, and her grandchild were there, and there were conditions so bad that they also chose to go back to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And when 5 Barracks turret (French). </sentence><sentence id="154">6 Petain, Henri (1856-1951); French marshal who corroborated with the Nazis and lead the French Vichy government during W.W.II. </sentence><sentence id="155">Bruce Wetterau, World History (<span class="populated place">New York</span>: <span class="building">Henry Holt Publishing</span>, 1994), 838. </sentence><sentence id="156">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="157">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="158"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection another Jewish family in that little <span class="populated place">village</span> called <span class="populated place">Saint-Julien du Corse</span>, population including I think the animals, was 600 people; but it was spread over miles and miles. </sentence><sentence id="159">It's a <span class="populated place">hamlet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">We chose to stay there, until the winter came, in which we then moved to the <span class="populated place">capital</span>, which is <span class="populated place">Brive</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And there we--suddenly on November, I think in November, were told that we had to report to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Agde</span>, the next morning, just to take the bare essentials, leave everything else and leave and go to <span class="populated place">Agde</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">And that's in November "40. </sentence><sentence id="163">We then reported to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">That was a real <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
