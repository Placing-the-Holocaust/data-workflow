they could ask you what was your mother's maiden name, what was your grandmother's maiden name, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2314">So people of course, and we weren't the only ones who were in

sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="4620">They were willing to take me into the sixth grade, and then I would learn Portuguese, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4621">So anyway, I had to learn
