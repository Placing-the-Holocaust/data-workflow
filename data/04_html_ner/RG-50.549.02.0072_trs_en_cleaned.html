I'd -- in order to begin, I'd like to ask you if -- if you, in the last 14 years since the interview that I saw took place, is there anything about your experience during the war that you've learned since then, that you'd like to go back and talk about it? </sentence><sentence id="12">Know -- how much you remember, exactly, about your interview, but I'm assuming that you -- it was clear to me that you've been doing research, and finding out more and more about what happened to you, since you were so young. </sentence><sentence id="13">Is there anything that you might want to add to what you already did? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: Let me get to that in one moment, but let me also make a -- not a disclaimer, but a commercial statement in a sense -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="16"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="17">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="18"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="19"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 ;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="76">Do you want to talk about some of things you've done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Well, I have probably spoken in a -- in a gazillion places. </sentence><sentence id="80">I've been involved locally with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council, which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah commemoration that's six, seven, 800 people, attendance thing, and all the largest <span class="building">synagogues</span> in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, I've chaired it for the last five years. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I did -- I've been a member of that commission for 15 or 18 years, but I thought maybe I'd like to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="82">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="83"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 deg become more involved. </sentence><sentence id="84">And that involves with some other elements of the Holocaust thing. </sentence><sentence id="85">Serve the <span class="building">museum</span>, <span class="building">museum</span> visits, <span class="building">museum</span> volunteering, some other things. </sentence><sentence id="86">I have some connection with the <span class="building">legislature</span>, as a consequence I've tried to help the council, and the <span class="building">museum</span> be involved with legislators to come to the <span class="building">museum</span>, or to meet them there, or to speak with them there. </sentence><sentence id="87">These are things I've done, I've -- anecdotally, one of the things I've done is our organizations that have silent auctions, I've been a silent auction museum tour giver in any number of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="88">If you bid on my particular offer, and it's a winning offer, whatever the organization decides, I will in fact take a half a day, and take you and four other people to the <span class="building">museum</span>, and the most interesting group I had once, was a -- a woman, I forget what her organization was, she called, and we arranged, and there were four women, and I, all veterinarians. </sentence><sentence id="89">I don't think they were Jewish, but they were involved in some organization, and they wanted to see the <span class="building">museum</span>, and I was there with four veterinarians. </sentence><sentence id="90">I had never been with that many veterinarians in my life, women or otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="91">Just an interesting combination of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: [ve done that, I have probably been involved in the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the three organizations that are Holocaust organizations in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">There is the <span class="populated place">Washington</span> fre -- th-the survivors and friends organization, with which you may be familiar. </sentence><sentence id="110">There is a <span class="building">child survivors organization</span>, which covers more <span class="populated place">Baltimore/ Washington</span>, and there's a second generation. </sentence><sentence id="111">And now there is a third generation This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="112">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="113"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 deg organization, and I have gotten to know some of the people, I've been involved in some of the meetings, some of the planning, some of the conferences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="123">That's quite a lot, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="124">And do you talk with the schoolchildren? </sentence><sentence id="125">Have you done any of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Well, for example, recently there was a cooperative program within the council and Comcast, and the [indecipherable] <span class="building">Olney theater</span>, here in <span class="populated place">Olney</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And several <span class="building">high school</span> classes were brought -- several <span class="building">high schools</span>, and they [indecipherable] 11" grade class, were brought together for a -- an orientation, a talk, a -- a video, and after that they even did projects expressing the Holocaust in art, music and design. </sentence><sentence id="132">And we spoke to those four <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">The next year, there were four other <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">These have been things that I've done. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was a training program, for example, for the <span class="building">Jewish Social Service Agency</span>, <span class="building">JESSA</span>, and five years ago, I think it was, when we spent four days, one day a week in four weeks, in a very comprehensive training program for their staff, including a visit to the <span class="building">museum</span>, which I, as a volunteer put together for them, with a director of the agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the assumption that if they deal with Holocaust survivors, they ou-ought to know something about the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Is it possible for you to summarize what -- how people react to your presentations when you meet with them? </sentence><sentence id="143">People who may not know a lot about the Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="144">I'm talking about groups aside from survivor groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: React in what way? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="149"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="150">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="151"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="152"> <span class="building">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 y </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: How do they react? </sentence><sentence id="154">I mean, what do they want to know, what -- what do they not know? </sentence><sentence id="155">What does it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Well -- there are probably at least two major kinds of presentation, and I do one because I'm unable, or whatever to do the other. </sentence><sentence id="157">The -- those presentations which are based in the emotional experience, but as I said to you, my emotional experience at the time was very limited, I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="158">So what I do is I do a much more -- not objective, but I guess it's an objective approach to describing what happened, from the eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="159">The reaction to that often is amazement, to the point, and this is again anecdotal, but I spoke to whatever, the fifth grade <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> class of my <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">And the fifth grade <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> class, one of them, included my grandson at the time. </sentence><sentence id="161">And he asked a question at the end. </sentence><sentence id="162">And he became so kind of involved in the description, he said, "Did you survive?" </sentence><sentence id="163">I'm his grandfather, I mean, he was like trying to ask, how did people survive, so he said to me, "Did you survive?" </sentence><sentence id="164">He's forgotten, I mean, this could have been a movie that I was describing. </sentence><sentence id="165">So the reaction tends to be less visceral in some sense, and more factual, because I tend to present factually, rather than emotionally, for many reasons, including the kind of person I am, and the nature of my experience, of people that I know in the <span class="populated place">community</span> who are one, two, three, four, five years older than I, whose experience was different as a consequence, they present differently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="177">That's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="178">Let's g -- let's go back to your chronology, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="179">It was 1949 when you came to this <span class="country">country</span> with your mother and father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
