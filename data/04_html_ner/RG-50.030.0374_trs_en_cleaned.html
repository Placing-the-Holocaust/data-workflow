the best punishment, just for that. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So they hid me every time that the Germans came to arrest people, take them to the <span class="building">stations</span> in the

a nurse of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and the card said she couldn't write to us. </sentence><sentence id="1421">But she wrote to him, and he was in <span class="populated

you need peoples without those damn Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1446">Because on top of it, all of our identity cards had the stamp Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1447">So he said, "I have to" -- "I can give you cards for everybody in your family." </sentence><sentence id="1448">And I asked him how much it would cost, and his response was to say, "How can you ask me how much it can cost? </sentence><sentence id="1449">Such a thing, you don't pay for. </sentence><sentence id="1450">I do it because that's what I believe in." </sentence><sentence id="1451">And he was a poor man, he was not a rich man at all at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And he did it, he gave us cards and that's why we could escape. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Because as long we had the Jew

but I have to say that. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1456">That Mr. Charpentier since he was very young had worked for one of the three or four Jewish families who
