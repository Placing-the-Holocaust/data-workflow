<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> that started to b- bombard the vicinity where the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was moving and the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> itself slowed down. </sentence><sentence id="42">And it was a <span class="region">wooded area</span> and the troops liquidated their <span class="building">post</span>, from the top of the <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. </sentence><sentence id="43">So that what we took and thank God, we were successful. </sentence><sentence id="44">And we were in the <span class="env feature">water</span> there, where -- where we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing our <span class="building">prison</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="45">And then we were -- we hid in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and -- until we met the American troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally stopped, and we sa -- went out from the <span class="env feature">woods</span> onto the open <span class="dlf">streets</span> and we were stopped by a American patrol, who took us to a <span class="populated place">POW camp</span> and then we were interrogated, and set free. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="46"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="47">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="48"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="49"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: You were set free, do you remember how you felt when they approached you? </sentence><sentence id="51">Were you afraid, did you -- did they know who you were? </sentence><sentence id="52">You weren't wearing <span class="building">prison</span> uniforms, you said, you had regular clothes on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: No, no, no, no, we're -- oh, you -- no, I'm sorry, when we -- when we met them, we were in civil uniforms, that's correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no hair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of the head, the <span class="dlf">street</span>, that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a little bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a <span class="dlf">street</span> or a mark to be a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="54">And we had a hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they were -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="55">And we choder -- we showed them our numbers on the arm and then they still didn't believe it, and they ask us when the Jewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes, you know, and t-took us into the <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> and drove us to <span class="building">headquarters</span>, where we met the colonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, from <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we told them, which wasn't very much, because within the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we had no knowledge what was going on outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">So we couldn't be, in that respect, any great help. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>, you and your brother were sort of on your own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: That's right, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that's why my brother traveled into <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, to see what is going on there and o -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial <span class="building">German factory</span> and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the <span class="building">house</span>, which we occupied after his leaving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
