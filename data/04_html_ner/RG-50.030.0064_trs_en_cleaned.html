<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: Tell us about the spoiled childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Well, we had a very large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">My father was an avid book collector. </sentence><sentence id="8">We had over 10,000 first editions. </sentence><sentence id="9">Uh...My mother and I would frequently go on vacations, and my uncle had a <span class="interior space">cabin</span> on the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">We would go there. </sentence><sentence id="11">We would go on ski vacations in the <span class="region">Austrian Alps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">We made trips to my mother's home country of <span class="country">Hungary</span> and things of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="13">It was just a...you know, I had all...I had all the things that a little girl my age could want. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: I don't remember...I don't remember too much about...I have very hazy...hazy memories about that, but...uh...everything changed with the Anschluss. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Why...why is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Uh...Even though I was only 8 years old at the time, I...I did notice there were, you know, the changes I saw. </sentence><sentence id="29">Men with arm bands, SI and SS going through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and I would...and they told me that these were bad people. </sentence><sentence id="30">And then I noticed that they would single out especially well dressed women to...uh...do menial jobs, clean out <span class="interior space">lavatories</span> and work on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And then a law was passed that all Jewish children had to go to a special <span class="building">school</span>, segregated <span class="building">school</span> if you will, and...uh...and I noticed there was a total change of attitude in my classmates. </sentence><sentence id="32">All those kids who had been friends of mine suddenly turned against me and started calling me names, started calling me dirty Jew. </sentence><sentence id="33">And I was not unhappy to leave, but then events...uh...happened so quickly that I never did get a chance to...uh...g0 to a segregated <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">And the other thing I noticed that the....you know, the words ...the yellow star, and the word J appearing on the <span class="building">window shops</span>, you know, shopkeepers and various <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">But it was all...it was all very bewildering. </sentence><sentence id="36">I just knew that something really bad had happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: What about your parents in all this? </sentence><sentence id="47">Did you see a change in attitude at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="51">I did. </sentence><sentence id="52">They suddenly became very worried, and there were a lot of family hush conferences behind closed <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">And then one day the Gestapo came to our...it was shortly after the Anschluss, the Gestapo came to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and took my father away for questioning. </sentence><sentence id="54">And all I knew...I didn't really know what was happening but my mother just said, "Those bad men came and took daddy away," and she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="55">And my father was gone for 3 days and we had no idea where they had taken him to or whether we were ever going to see him again and then he finally did come back and he look rather bedraggled. </sentence><sentence id="56">And  then there was another hurried conference and with my grandparents who lived in the suburb of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and some close friends, we decided that...or my parents decided we had to leave <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and that our only chance was to go to <span class="country">France</span> and it was really a last minute decision and very hurriedly we decided to leave everything behind and just pack a couple <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">And I remember the one memory that I have is my mother telling me that I was to go to my <span class="interior space">room</span> and just pick the few <span class="spatial object">toys</span> that I wanted to take with me and to be fast about it. </sentence><sentence id="58">And I remember that I was started piling up a whole pile of my favorite dolls and mother came and she said, "Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="59">You can't take all this." </sentence><sentence id="60">And she picked two dolls, and she said, "You can take two dolls. </sentence><sentence id="61">Period." </sentence><sentence id="62">And I was crying, you know, didn't really...I felt it was terribly unfair to do this to me. </sentence><sentence id="63">And so we just...they just threw some clothes in <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and...uh...we went and said goodbye to my grandparents and...uh...that was the last time that L...I was to see them again. </sentence><sentence id="64">We took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> at night and...uh...went to...uh...<span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">I remember the only recollection I have the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was stopped at the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and there was a period of anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="66">I could see that my parents were extremely nervous, but everything went fine and we actually made it safely to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> about...was about the end of 1938. </sentence><sentence id="67">And we were trying to start a new life. ( </sentence><sentence id="68">Sigh) And, of course, it didn't work out this way. </sentence><sentence id="69">We...we got to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and...uh...my father was...succeeded in finding some work again as a journalist and rented a beautiful <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">Uh...My mother...my grandfather on my mother's side had succeeded in going to...uh...<span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">So he had invited us to come over and we made a one-month's trip to <span class="country">England</span>, visited him and we came back to...uh...<span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">I was enrolled in the <span class="building">school</span> which was correspond about the 3rd grade. </sentence><sentence id="73">Didn't speak French at the time and I...I was just thrown into a <span class="interior space">classroom</span> with the other children. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was sink or swim, but...uh...within a matter of months I picked up the language and felt quite comfortable and </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: Slowly down if you would a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: I would like to know what those few months in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> were like for you as a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: Well, at first there was the sheer wonderment. </sentence><sentence id="107">You know, it's <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">It was an extremely exciting <span class="populated place">city</span> for me. </sentence><sentence id="109">It's a beautiful <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">And there was so many...so many things to do. </sentence><sentence id="111">And there were so many sights and sounds, and also the fact that I really did not know the language and the way I learned it is my parents would send me to the <span class="building">grocery store</span> and they would say what I was to say because they know...knew a little bit of French. </sentence><sentence id="112">And I would repeat it and it felt strange to...you know, I was saying things I didn't really understand. </sentence><sentence id="113">Uh...But in <span class="building">school</span>, everything seemed to be going alright. </sentence><sentence id="114">You know, there are a lot of memories that are not so distinct from that period so there are just little glimpses here, you know, like little cameos here and there that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="115">I...uh...did find one good friend in my age and we used to pal around and just walked around in the nearby <span class="env feature">woods</span> and went to the <span class="building">zoo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">You know, things that kids our...our age do. </sentence><sentence id="117">But..-uh...that's about all I remember until....until the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="118">And...uh...then again, we...we started hearing rumors of impending war 1939. </sentence><sentence id="119">And...uh...we started hearing about air raids, and I remember that at <span class="building">school</span>...you know, we were told we would all have to get gas masks. </sentence><sentence id="120">And so they lined us  up and they fitted us with gas masks and I thought it was just horrible, horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="121">They gave us a big long, <span class="spatial object">lead box</span> which we carried a mask in and we were to carry them with us at all times. </sentence><sentence id="122">And...uh...the one thing I remember is just the suffocating, real disgusting smell of rubber that emanated and the fact that I had a feeling that I was choking. </sentence><sentence id="123">And then...uh...we had air raid drills and my father had cautioned me and said, "You know, if you hear a noise and noise like a siren...if it should happen in the middle of the night, don't be frightened. </sentence><sentence id="124">Just get dressed very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="125">It means we all have to go down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>." </sentence><sentence id="126">And...uh...one night I actually did hear the noise, and I went to my dad's <span class="interior space">room</span> and I said, "Daddy, is the noise where we have to go to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>." </sentence><sentence id="127">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="128">And I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="129">So we...we did go and there was a...there was an air raid and, you know, and we were just sitting there in the damp <span class="interior space">cave</span> and everybody wearing a gas mask. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was really a sight out of science fiction almost, and one time there was an air raid while I was at <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And all my teacher all herded us into the <span class="building">air raid shelter</span> and the bombs started dropping. </sentence><sentence id="132">We could hear them outside and we were terribly frightened. </sentence><sentence id="133">And when we came out, you know, we were wondering, you know, was...was the <span class="building">house</span> going to be there? </sentence><sentence id="134">Were my parents still going to be there? </sentence><sentence id="135">It was a very....you know, it was a lot of anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="136">Uh...And then as the Germans were approaching, you know, the French wanted to deny access so they...they blew up...they were going to blow up some <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, but they decided against it, but they blew up <span class="spatial object">petroleum tanks</span> and the personal recollection I have that on that day when they blew up the pet...petroleum <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Sevran</span> which is just across the <span class="env feature">river</span> ___ <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">My mother and I had been out shopping and it started to rain and suddenly the rain became down was a black gooey kind of rain very, you know, like oil. </sentence><sentence id="138">And so what had happened apparently is that the oil from the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> had mixed with rain so it was falling down, was almost pure oil and when we got...our clothes were just totally ruined and when we got to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, the curtains were all black and everything. </sentence><sentence id="139">And they cautioned us not to drink the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And just as we came in, I had drunk a glass of water and then the announcement came over the radio, "Don't drink the water." </sentence><sentence id="141">And I was just terribly frightened. </sentence><sentence id="142">I thought, "Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="143">I'm going to die." </sentence><sentence id="144">And the little girlfriend who happened to be visiting said to comfort me, "Oh, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="145">You're not going to die right away. </sentence><sentence id="146">Just in a couple hours maybe." ( </sentence><sentence id="147">Laughing) And...uh...then at that period when the Germans were very close, you know, there was an exodus that we couldn't...we couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="148">My father was drafted into the...uh...an arm of the...of the French army which was four foreign nationals. </sentence><sentence id="149">And first they sent him to a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Normandy</span>, and again he was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="150">We didn't know where he went, whether he would come back and...uh...we...we took us...we finally got word of where he was held and they had put him into another place...uh...in the <span class="building">hospital</span> called. , </sentence><sentence id="151">and he was working there I...we found out as a cook. </sentence><sentence id="152">And it took us...my mother and me several weeks before we were allowed to visit. </sentence><sentence id="153">We would go there early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="154">We would stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> waiting to be let in with the other wives and children, and then they'd say, "Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="155">Come back tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="156">And this was going on for several...several weeks and we finally got to see him. </sentence><sentence id="157">And he was actually working as a cook because as a Viennese, you know, they thought he could make some pastries. ( </sentence><sentence id="158">Laughing) And he said he'd been fairly...fairly well treated, but then he was transferred again to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we didn't know again for a long time where we had...he had gone. </sentence><sentence id="159">And then...uh...we got news that they had put him to do...uh...<span class="dlf">street</span> work, and he was working  with...uh... you know, an ax and a shovel and he had gotten blood poisoning from the friction. </sentence><sentence id="160">You know, dirt had gotten into it and he was near death at that point and a...uh...one of his fellow...uh...workers just took a <span class="spatial object">kitchen knife</span> and opened the wound and drained it and saved his life, so they did discharge him and he came back to us looking, you know, very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="161">And then he got word that he would be transferred to a...uh...a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, <span class="populated place">work camp</span> in...uh... somewhere in south of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">We...we didn't know where he was going to be and just remembered that one thing, he took me on his knees and he said, "How would you like your daddy to be a soldier?" </sentence><sentence id="163">And I...I said, "Well, does that mean you're going to have to go away?" </sentence><sentence id="164">And he said, "Yes," and I said...and I started to cry and I said, "Oh, Daddy. </sentence><sentence id="165">Please don't leave me with Mommy because Mommy is so nervous." ( </sentence><sentence id="166">Laughing) And..but he did...he did go and...uh...1 remember that after he left, the...we were still...we had a pretty nice <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in a nice <span class="region">area</span> of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, but things were...had turned really bad. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then the Germans actually, actually came in to the...to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and on the day...just on the day that they marched in, I had gone out shopping and a woman came running over to me and she stopped me and she said, "Honey, don't go any further because." </sentence><sentence id="168">German which was on the main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">The Germans are on the , and please we have heard horror stories. </sentence><sentence id="170">You know, they would butcher children and rape women and so everybody was just terrified. </sentence><sentence id="171">So I ran back in and told my mother and I wouldn't go out unless...uh...my mother was with me and as soon as they came, we noticed that things got to be extremely bad. </sentence><sentence id="172">All the food disappeared and everything was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="173">We could only obtain things on the <span class="building">black market</span>, but we had no money so we weren't able to buy anything. </sentence><sentence id="174">We had...winter came. </sentence><sentence id="175">We had no...no heat and things just went from...from bad to worse. </sentence><sentence id="176">And at...at that period, you know...uh...the...uh...you know, after the Armistice was signed and <span class="country">France</span> was divided into two <span class="region">regions</span>...uh...we were in the <span class="region">occupied region</span> and my father, when he was in <span class="region">Southern France</span>, was in what was still the free, the <span class="region">unoccupied zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">And he start...he wanted us to join him. </sentence><sentence id="178">At first, of course, when he went there we...we didn't know where he was, and we finally got word that very... The news...news was scarce because news was censored. </sentence><sentence id="179">You weren't allowed to write letters, so all you could get were preprinted cards. </sentence><sentence id="180">And on the cards, you had to fill out....you know, they had preprinted sets of statements and they would say I am in good health; sick or dead. </sentence><sentence id="181">And you have to check off what you had. </sentence><sentence id="182">And then it said, "T haven't heard from...and there was a blank for that, and...uh..something like, you know, I don't...I forget, but it was very sketchy and so you had to use your ingenuity to kind of convey the message, so I just maybe my father finally managed to tell us where he was in case that we should try to...to join him. </sentence><sentence id="183">And then we got word that he had managed to get a visa for all of us to the <span class="country">United States</span> and he said, "Please, just do anything to get out of there." ( </sentence><sentence id="184">Sigh) But as fate would have it, I came down with the measles. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I was very ill, and by the time I recovered the visas had lapsed and already, and we had lapse...lost our last chance to go to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">I always think, you know, something a trick of fate you know. </sentence><sentence id="187">The...the measles. </sentence><sentence id="188">And could have avoided the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="189">So that...so that chance was lost and by that time there were no more <span class="dlf">passages</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">A friend...some very close friends of ours had actually left on the last <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and we had gotten reports that the <span class="env feature">Atlantic</span> was mined and it was just, you know, too dangerous to even attempt it. </sentence><sentence id="191">And then the Gestapo paid us another visit in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">When they came...and they came asking for my father and my mother said, "Well, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="193">I don't know." </sentence><sentence id="194">And he said, "Well, how come?" </sentence><sentence id="195">You  know, she said, "I don't know." </sentence><sentence id="196">And he said, "Well, do you have any letters from your husband?" </sentence><sentence id="197">And she said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="198">And he said, "What kind of wife doesn't keep letters from her husband?" </sentence><sentence id="199">And she said, "Well, I just didn't keep them." </sentence><sentence id="200">And then they wanted to know the whereabouts of...uh...friends of...of my father's. </sentence><sentence id="201">And...uh...my mother said she didn't know anything and so they pulled out a list and she said, "We...okay, you don't want to tell us. </sentence><sentence id="202">We'll tell you." </sentence><sentence id="203">And they started rattling off name on.... "We've never heard of him." </sentence><sentence id="204">And then they started searching the <span class="building">house</span>, and they just removed everything from <span class="interior space">closets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">They took <span class="interior space">drawers</span>, overturned them, you know, just looking for any kind of document. </sentence><sentence id="206">Anything that would have been helpful to them. </sentence><sentence id="207">Then they started going through the <span class="spatial object">bookcase</span> and they start throwing down books and my mother knew that in one book, she had actually kept the names and addresses of friends of ours which we would have needed had we...you know, if we were able to get away. </sentence><sentence id="208">We had a...that was our way to contact them. </sentence><sentence id="209">And they stopped short of that one <span class="spatial object">bookcase</span> where that particular book was. </sentence><sentence id="210">They just gave us their search, and just stopped short of that one <span class="spatial object">bookcase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">So my mother kind of breathed a sigh of relief, and then they almost apologetically said, "Well, you know, we had orders. </sentence><sentence id="212">We had to do this." </sentence><sentence id="213">And at one point I remember...it's just...a little child recollection, one of the officer's dropped his cap and well brought up child that I was, I picked it up and I gave it to him. </sentence><sentence id="214">And he looked at me and he said, "You...that child doesn't look too bad. </sentence><sentence id="215">We saw a little girl next <span class="dlf">door</span> was a really Juden Cop." </sentence><sentence id="216">And so they left, but my mother was trembling, you know, with rage, everything. </sentence><sentence id="217">And she yelled after them, "You dogs!" </sentence><sentence id="218">And then she said, "Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="219">What have I done?" </sentence><sentence id="220">you know. </sentence><sentence id="221">But fortunately, they didn't...they didn't hear her. </sentence><sentence id="222">And so at that point, she started making inquiries on how to get to the <span class="region">unoccupied zone</span>, and we knew first of all you had to have a guide across because the <span class="dlf">border</span> was heavily guarded between the two <span class="region">zones</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">And you had to have money to pay a guide which we didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="224">And so she tried to sell our household goods, but she was told by the Consiers that there was a law that Jewish people could not sell anything. </sentence><sentence id="225">So she couldn't do that, but she managed to somehow, you know, sell her wedding ring. </sentence><sentence id="226">And that gave us a little bit of money and then through a grapevine that was in operation at the time, she found out the name of a guide in...near the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, and made arrangements for us to go there. </sentence><sentence id="227">So, again, we just...just threw a couple of things in <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>, left all our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, everything behind and set out. </sentence><sentence id="228">And I am not really clear on how we...you know, it's a distance about several hundred miles from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">I think that we rode <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and sometimes we walked, but Iam really, you know, sure but we got there. </sentence><sentence id="230">But, however, we had to be in the <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Mondinotso</span>, which near <span class="populated place">Bordo</span>, at a certain date to meet our guide. </sentence><sentence id="231">But because things were rather haphazard, you know, in traveling and delays, we got there...we were several days late. </sentence><sentence id="232">And by the time we got there, the guide had already left on another assignment, and there was no one there to help us across. </sentence><sentence id="233">And..uh..the ...uh...I guess it was the family of the guide told us, "Well, the only thing you can do is try it on your own." </sentence><sentence id="234">And she said, "Wait until about 2 o'clock when the <span class="dlf">border</span> is unguarded. </sentence><sentence id="235">Because at that time, the Germans are away having their beers and their having their siesta. </sentence><sentence id="236">So at that point, you could probably risk getting across." </sentence><sentence id="237">Now we spent sometime in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, you know, wondering around and we had gotten there early in the morning and then we waited. </sentence><sentence id="238">We tried to lay low. </sentence><sentence id="239">We went...stopped in a <span class="building">cafe</span> and there was some German soldiers there and we pretended to be tourists...French tourists. </sentence><sentence id="240">And one of them started a conversation with my mother and she  kind of you know, laughed it off. </sentence><sentence id="241">And...and then we headed for the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">And we saw was just <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, and there was no one in sight. </sentence><sentence id="243">My mother lifted a piece of <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and crawled across and I guess she threw her <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> over. </sentence><sentence id="244">She had two little <span class="spatial object">cases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I was to follow her. </sentence><sentence id="246">And in the process, the little dress I was wearing got caught on one of the spikes of the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and I was impaled on the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">And...uh...then my mother realizing what happened, she looked back and she came and she gave my dress a sharp yank and I was...I was freed, and...uh...but then as soon as we got across, you know, it seemed to me that I was hearing voices. </sentence><sentence id="248">It was probably the wind in the <span class="env feature">trees</span> but everything was so quiet, but I kept hearing voices saying, "You are arrested. </sentence><sentence id="249">You are arrested." </sentence><sentence id="250">So I was so...you know, wrought my imagine was so wrought up. </sentence><sentence id="251">And sure enough, a few feet...we had gone a few feet and we were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="252">And those were the French police which in many cases were much nice than, you know, any...anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="253">They're the local police there and they asked us what we were doing there and why we were there and we..my...you know, my mother just made up a story...uh...but it turned out that they were only looking for smugglers, and contraband, cigarettes, and that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="254">And so they weren't really interested in us, and we didn't look like very threatening types. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so they let us go and we managed to get onto a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and finally go across into the <span class="region">free zone</span>, and we joined my father in a..-uh...in the , <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">He was...uh...in the...in the <span class="populated place">work camp</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Longglad</span>, and he and his other comrades had been put to work doing odd jobs, working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, working on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, working in the <span class="building">soap factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">And... uh...there were people there from all walks of life, all nationalities, and they were called...they were called Prestetiers which was their term for, you know, those type of...those type nationals. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh...My father had found a little...an abandoned <span class="building">house</span> for us in the nearby <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Kalvison</span>, and so we headed there and found the <span class="building">house</span> and it was really dilapidated. </sentence><sentence id="259">It was something straight out of the middle ages. </sentence><sentence id="260">It had a stone hearth, it kept laying down. </sentence><sentence id="261">It had <span class="interior space">stone floors</span>, and it, you know, clearly hadn't been lived in for many, many years and the first thing we saw was a scorpion just standing from the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">And... uh...when...you know, there was hardly any <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">It was sort of a kind of Charles Adam's type of <span class="building">house</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="264">Laughing) And when we went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> that night, we heard strange noises <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and I was terribly frightened and looked like somebody was bowling. </sentence><sentence id="265">And my father went to investigate and there was all those rats up there rolling things around. ( </sentence><sentence id="266">Laughing) And then, you know, we figured...uh...and then suddenly, when we started sleeping, we started itching. </sentence><sentence id="267">And so we looked and we had only candles and we looked and there was all those bed bugs that were in...inside the...the woodwork of the...of the <span class="spatial object">bed frame</span> and we spent most of the night killing bed bugs, but we survived. </sentence><sentence id="268">The only thing is that when it rained there... uh...and we in kind of a <span class="region">low lying area</span>, the whole place flooded <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and we had to bail out. </sentence><sentence id="269">But at least, you know, we were safe. </sentence><sentence id="270">We were in a <span class="region">free zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">We weren't hunted anymore. </sentence><sentence id="272">We had a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over our head and that's all that matters. </sentence><sentence id="273">And so I resumed the semi-normal activities. </sentence><sentence id="274">I was enrolled in a <span class="building">local school system</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="275">I made a few friends. </sentence><sentence id="276">And we were, of course, heavily indoctrinated at the time. </sentence><sentence id="277">We were made to march on the <span class="dlf">country roads</span>, singing songs to the glory of Marshall Petain. </sentence><sentence id="278">And I remember that they had a contest for Mother's Day in that <span class="building">school</span>, and we were all to do something because at that point, the words...the slogan was motherhood and you know, the <span class="building">church</span> and the family. </sentence><sentence id="279">And they were trying to encourage people to have a large family, so motherhood was very big. </sentence><sentence id="280">And they wanted us kids to...to knit something  or crochet, and I was never able to do anything with my hands, so I said that I would write...oh, the heck with it, I'll write a poem for Mother's day. </sentence><sentence id="281">And it was very corny, but they loved it because the poem got first prize. </sentence><sentence id="282">I got a letter from Marshall Petain (laughing) which unfortunately I did not keep. </sentence><sentence id="283">And...uh...then my...my gift, the choice of the prize was I could have a book or I could have a sausage. </sentence><sentence id="284">And that was big deal, big choice because food was extremely scarce again. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I...1, you know, I debate...I said, "Well, now a sausage. </sentence><sentence id="286">After I eat it, it's gone. </sentence><sentence id="287">A book will last forever, so I picked the book." ( </sentence><sentence id="288">Laughing) My mother didn't like the poem because it was very sentimental and she said it kind of nauseated her, but they like it so that was the main thing. </sentence><sentence id="289">We started really suffering from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="290">Uh...My father where he was, he got some kind of gruel and, you know, some anemic soup, but where we were there was just nothing to be had, and we lived on mostly ...uh...green peppers and tomatoes. </sentence><sentence id="291">There were no potatoes and on the one bright event in that part of our lives was that neighbors for our father's birthday gave us three potatoes, and that was a wonderful gift. </sentence><sentence id="292">And we figured out all kinds of of ways to...to fix those three potatoes so that they would last longer. </sentence><sentence id="293">And the only thing to eat were grapes because that <span class="country">country</span> was abundant in grapes, and I would take part in the grape harvesting and in that way I would get to eat all the grapes I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="294">So during...that season that was something I had to eat. </sentence><sentence id="295">And I remember that because...uh...I was a <span class="building">school</span> child. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was...by that time, I was 12 years old, and we would get a small ration of milk, a little container of milk for...for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="297">And I remember that on the way <span class="building">home</span> I would stop by the <span class="spatial object">fountain</span>, village fountain and add water to it to give me the illusion that it was a little more. </sentence><sentence id="298">But it was the first time that we, you know, we really knew what it was to be very hungry, to go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> at night hungry, to wake up hungry, and not to have any heat. </sentence><sentence id="299">In the winter, my father had heard, for instance, that there was some <span class="dlf">railroad trestles</span> to be had so he brought these <span class="building">home</span>, but they were covered with tar so they made a horrible smoke and...and scent with that. </sentence><sentence id="300">Uh...But you know, we, you know, we...we still managed to get along, you know, muddled by. </sentence><sentence id="301">And then came the bad news. </sentence><sentence id="302">We heard that all of <span class="country">France</span> is going to be occupied. </sentence><sentence id="303">So again our last, you know, <span class="building">refuge</span> was about to be gone. </sentence><sentence id="304">We...we were once again...we had, you know, we had the Gestapo breathing down our neck, and ...uh...again we thought, "Well, we're going to have to...we're going to have to leave." </sentence><sentence id="305">And my father was...uh...told by the commander of his <span class="populated place">work camp</span> that he would have to report somewhere else and possibly be sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">So at this point he decided to go sort of AWOL. </sentence><sentence id="307">And he went <span class="building">home</span> and he put on his pajamas and went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, had a local doctor who was very sympathetic to the plight of Jews, refugees, issue a certificate that he was suffering from a serious heart condition, and he could not leave his <span class="spatial object">bed</span> for under any circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="308">So my father did in fact stay in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and if anybody came to the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> asking, you know, my mother said, "That my husband is very, very ill, you know, and if they want to see for themselves they could." </sentence><sentence id="309">And the doctor who issued was also the Protestant Pastor of the <span class="populated place">town</span>, and his wife was very active in the various philanthropic...uh...you know, types of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they tried to figure out a way for us to get out of here, and the first thing to do was for us to get IDs because if we were going to travel anywhere we needed to have IDs which all the French people had to have anyway but we could not have our real names. </sentence><sentence id="311">So they managed with the major of the <span class="populated place">town</span> to issue us fake IDs and they changed our name to Sabier, which might sound French name and they changed our birth dates and the place, and they made us  citizens of <span class="populated place">Alvis Lorraine</span>, and they did that because my parents, at least, still had an accent. </sentence><sentence id="312">And saying that there were from <span class="populated place">Alvis Lorraine</span>, then they would be quite natural because they would speak just like people there. </sentence><sentence id="313">And so we...we had that, and then the...uh...the pasteur's wife figured out...she had heard about the <span class="populated place">children's camp</span> ...uh...somewhere....think there was...I'm not sure exactly....it was...maybe in the or somewhere, that I could go to. </sentence><sentence id="314">And she thought that perhaps I should be sent there because we didn't know what lay ahead, and she thought maybe I at least I could be saved and so my family thought about it and we talked about it and then in the last minute, they decided not to, because they said, "We'll...let's... whatever comes, let's...we want to face together," and I didn't want to be separated and it turned out to be a very wise decision because we found out later on that all the children from this <span class="populated place">camp</span> had been deported. </sentence><sentence id="315">The German...so it was just one of the things. </sentence><sentence id="316">Now, through the...uh...through the pasteur, again, the <span class="env feature">grapevine</span> was in work, we found out...he gave us the name of another Protestant Pasteur in a <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> which was about, oh, 10 miles from the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">And the idea was for us to try to find refuge in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, which had retained its neutrality and was still really the only place that we...that we had left to run to. </sentence><sentence id="318">But again we knew that the <span class="dlf">border</span> was heavily guarded and that the Swiss were not exactly crazy about having that...that many people come, although they wouldn't necessarily turn them back. </sentence><sentence id="319">Uh...But it was difficult, and..-uh...some people were...had been turned back. </sentence><sentence id="320">They would...uh...they would let children in, but people under 18 were frequently...if they were caught close to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, they were turned back to the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="321">So we knew that was a lot of danger, but we had to risk it. </sentence><sentence id="322">And so the idea was, again, for us to find someone, a guide, who could lead us across to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">And we were given the name of a Protestant Pasteur that we would see in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>, and he would kind of ____. </sentence><sentence id="324">So, again, we just left in a great hurry. </sentence><sentence id="325">We left all our belongings with the neighbors and saying that, "Okay, when we know where we are, you can send it to us," and we never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="326">Uh...So we...basically, we just had the clothes on our back. </sentence><sentence id="327">Very little money, and our fake IDs. </sentence><sentence id="328">And that's how we set out. </sentence><sentence id="329">When we reached the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>, we looked up the pasteur. </sentence><sentence id="330">The pasteur had left. </sentence><sentence id="331">He'd gotten scared. </sentence><sentence id="332">That there had too many...you know, he had been turned in, and he just got frightened and he said, "Sorry, there is just nothing we can do." </sentence><sentence id="333">And they gave us the name of a very rich Jewish family that happened to live in that <span class="populated place">town</span> and they said maybe they can do something for you. </sentence><sentence id="334">So we went over there. </sentence><sentence id="335">And they said, "Well, how much money do you have." </sentence><sentence id="336">We said, "We don't." </sentence><sentence id="337">He said, "You know we have to have money to get across the <span class="dlf">border</span>." </sentence><sentence id="338">And we didn't have any money and I'm...you know, I'm sorry that fellow Jews didn't come off too well at that point, but...uh...the only thing they told us was to go to the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> and see if they could help us, and gave us a name of a certain priest who had been active in helping Jews. </sentence><sentence id="339">So we went to the <span class="building">church</span> of the <span class="building">Notre Dame</span> in <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>, and we asked for the...the priest. </sentence><sentence id="340">But he had left. </sentence><sentence id="341">He was gone. </sentence><sentence id="342">So his housekeeper said, "Okay, well, we can give you the name of these people in the <span class="populated place">bordertown</span> of, you know, it was just a very small <span class="populated place">town</span> on the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">And they had a <span class="building">farm house</span> and you go see them and...uh...they could find you a guide. </sentence><sentence id="344">Uh...So, again, we...we set out and we reached the <span class="populated place">bordertown</span> and we got there with...early in the morning, and they said, "Well, you know, it's much too dangerous to try to attempt to do anything right now, and so this is what you do and they pointed to a fairly high <span class="env feature">mountain</span> just behind the <span class="building">farm house</span> and they gave us a  couple...some provisions and they said, "You climb up that <span class="env feature">mountain</span> and you stay there." </sentence><sentence id="345">And you know, "under cover until night fall and at night fall, my husband will come and look for you and he will whistle twice and when you hear the whistle, you answer. </sentence><sentence id="346">You come out hiding and you identify yourselves and he will lead you down and he will lead you to your guide." </sentence><sentence id="347">So we went up there. </sentence><sentence id="348">We went...climbed on top and it was a very, very arduous climb and we weren't in the best of shape to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="349">And we finally got up there and we kind of sank down on the bare <span class="env feature">pine needles</span> and waited and...uh...it was October and as, you know, in <span class="region">mountain country</span> it gets cold very early in the season and it started getting cold, and we didn't really have anything to cover ourselves with, but we figured, "Well, the guide is supposed to come any minute now." </sentence><sentence id="350">And then it got darker and then suddenly we saw some lights go on, and there were...there was a whole mass of them down in the <span class="env feature">valley</span>, and we figured it must be <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">We were looking right at <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">We were on the <span class="dlf">mountaintop</span>, looking down on <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">It was the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> called Mountain of the <span class="env feature">Salav</span>, and we felt at that point, really felt like the...you know, Israelites looking at the <span class="region">Promised Land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">It was so near. </sentence><sentence id="355">You know, we could almost touch it and yet it was so far and we wondered if we would be denied like Moses, you know. </sentence><sentence id="356">Say okay, you can look at it, but you can't go in. </sentence><sentence id="357">And then it got really dark, and my father finally said, "Look, I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="358">There must have been something with the guide. </sentence><sentence id="359">Either we missed him or he didn't see us. </sentence><sentence id="360">We didn't hear him or something went wrong, but we can't stay because if we stay on this <span class="dlf">mountaintop</span>, we're going to die of exposure or starvation. </sentence><sentence id="361">We have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="362">So we decide to climb down and try to find a <span class="building">farmhouse</span>, anything, just to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="363">And...but it was pitch black, and we really didn't have any idea where we're going so we decided to go Indian file, and just holding hands and marking and I remember the...it was like, you know, three people traveling in a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="364">We were banging into <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">We were stumbling on <span class="env feature">rocks</span> on the way, you know. </sentence><sentence id="366">We were falling and it was just...and we had no idea what directions we were going or whether we ever go down the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">We were just sort of following instinct. </sentence><sentence id="368">And then after awhile, we had gone for what seemed hours, we saw light in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="369">So we went toward the light and almost like by miracle, we wound up at the same <span class="building">farmhouse</span> where we had started out the night before. </sentence><sentence id="370">And it was just providence, really. </sentence><sentence id="371">And we knocked. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was late. </sentence><sentence id="373">And we knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and the farm wife came and she said, "What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="374">She was just aghast. </sentence><sentence id="375">She said, "My husband went to look for you and he whistled and you didn't answer, so he thought that something happened and so he left." </sentence><sentence id="376">And we said, "We never...we must have got our signals crossed, but we never heard him." </sentence><sentence id="377">And she said, "Unfortunately, the guide who was supposed to take you across has left. </sentence><sentence id="378">You missed the connection because you were supposed to leave, you know." </sentence><sentence id="379">So she said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="380">Can't do anything now," so she pointed to a <span class="building">stable</span> and she said, "There's some straw there," and she gave us a glass of milk and some bread and she said, "Go there in the <span class="building">stable</span> where you be safe and...uh...in the morning we'll figure out what to do with you." </sentence><sentence id="381">And so very, very early morning...and she said, "You know, you've got to get out of here in a hurry because some guy has already come by, you know, and asking questions, and she said, "you've got to get out." </sentence><sentence id="382">She says, "I made up a story." </sentence><sentence id="383">And so she said, "Look, I'm going to send you"...she named the name of the next <span class="populated place">town</span>...uh...<span class="populated place">Cologne</span>...she said, "I lived...and you will look for a <span class="building">bakery</span> there, and you go in and you tell the baker who sent you and he will lead you out his <span class="dlf">back door</span> which is in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>." </sentence><sentence id="384">You know, the other  <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">You go out the <span class="dlf">back door</span> and you're in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and you'll be safe. ( </sentence><sentence id="386">laughing) And we thought, "Well, that sounds...that sounds good to us." </sentence><sentence id="387">you know. ( </sentence><sentence id="388">laughing) So we...we set out for the <span class="populated place">town</span> and we went around and we couldn't find the <span class="building">bakery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">And...uh...as in any small <span class="populated place">town</span>, three strangers with a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> wondering around are very conspicuous and we knew that, you know, at any moment, we'd be caught. </sentence><sentence id="390">And my father said, "Why don't you go," because we were right on the <span class="dlf">border</span> and my father sent me and said, "Go look. </sentence><sentence id="391">Go check it out. </sentence><sentence id="392">You know, you're a kid. </sentence><sentence id="393">You know you won't be so noticed." </sentence><sentence id="394">So I went ahead and I saw the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and I saw the guards standing there and it was heavily guarded and I came back and I said, "No way," you know, "We're not going to make it." </sentence><sentence id="395">And next thing you know, a big <span class="spatial object">limousine</span> pulled up and a guy...guy got out and headed straight for the <span class="building">police station</span> and then the next thing was two policemen came out and arrested us and took us to the <span class="building">station house</span>, you know, because the apparently was a person who was, you know, a snitcher. </sentence><sentence id="396">The French have a cute name for it. </sentence><sentence id="397">They call it a <span class="building">Mooshab</span>, but it's somebody who tells on people. </sentence><sentence id="398">And so again, the questioning started. </sentence><sentence id="399">They wanted to know what we're doing, and my father again made up a story. </sentence><sentence id="400">He said that they were going to put me ina <span class="building">home</span> for children in the <span class="region">area</span>, and that the priest had sent us, you know, but they didn't...just didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="401">And then they took us in. </sentence><sentence id="402">They frisked us. </sentence><sentence id="403">They took my...a matron took my mother and me in a <span class="interior space">room</span> and told us to strip and...uh...and...uh... the matron said to me, "Aren't you afraid?" </sentence><sentence id="404">I said, "No." ( </sentence><sentence id="405">laughing) And then...and then...uh...they asked to see our IDs, so my father produced our fake IDs and they said, "Who do you think you're kidding. </sentence><sentence id="406">Anybody looking at them can tell these are fake. </sentence><sentence id="407">I mean, look at that <span class="spatial object">stamp</span> there." </sentence><sentence id="408">And my father, "Oh No. </sentence><sentence id="409">No. </sentence><sentence id="410">I assure you." " </sentence><sentence id="411">Oh, come on," you know. </sentence><sentence id="412">And he said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="413">Tell you what I'm going to do. </sentence><sentence id="414">I am going to call the mayor of the <span class="populated place">town</span> where those IDs were made out. </sentence><sentence id="415">We'll see who's telling the truth." </sentence><sentence id="416">So by that time, my father started crying. </sentence><sentence id="417">We were all crying and we said okay, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="418">Goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="419">So we sat there and waited and the guy was gone for a very long time and he came back and he said, "Well, you pulled it off. </sentence><sentence id="420">The mayor of the <span class="populated place">town</span> has confirmed your identity. </sentence><sentence id="421">You are free to go." </sentence><sentence id="422">And we never knew whether he had just pretended to phone, to give the appearance of...in front of the others of doing his duty or whether in fact the mayor of the <span class="populated place">town</span> had, you know, sensed what was up and said, "Yal, Sure." </sentence><sentence id="423">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="424">All we knew was that he said we're free to go. </sentence><sentence id="425">And we just couldn't believe that, and their whole demeanor changed because actually, they didn't want to hurt, you know, people like us. </sentence><sentence id="426">They, you know, they had orders but by and large, our experience with the French police had always been extremely good. </sentence><sentence id="427">They did not like what was going on anymore than anyone else and they would try to help whenever they could within the limits that they were entitled. </sentence><sentence id="428">And so they turned to be very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="429">They gave my father some cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="430">They gave me a bar of chocolate, and...uh...they said, "Okay, you go. </sentence><sentence id="431">But please don't try this again. </sentence><sentence id="432">Don't. </sentence><sentence id="433">Don't because if you do, we're going to have to turn you over to the authorities this time." </sentence><sentence id="434">And so we figured, "Okay, but where are we going to go." </sentence><sentence id="435">You know, you hit the end of the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">Where...where are you going to go. </sentence><sentence id="437">We have to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">We had only what we were wearing. </sentence><sentence id="439">We had no money. </sentence><sentence id="440">And there was no other safe place for us to go to, and so the only thing that we could figure out to do was to go back of this <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>, go back to the <span class="building">Catholic church</span>, and see if they could do anything for us. </sentence><sentence id="441">And so we started out on the <span class="dlf">road</span> and then suddenly we heard somebody calling our name and there was a woman on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> pedaling furiously and she says, "Are you the  people who just left the <span class="building">station house</span> a few minutes ago." </sentence><sentence id="442">And we thought, "Oh, my gosh. </sentence><sentence id="443">Now what?" " </sentence><sentence id="444">Yal." </sentence><sentence id="445">And she says, "Well, I'm the wife of one of the officers there and he was worried about you, and he thought maybe you should come back with us and have dinner because you looked so starved and everything you know. </sentence><sentence id="446">Maybe you should give yourself a chance." </sentence><sentence id="447">But we just...we just didn't...even though she seemed perfectly nice, we just didn't trust her. </sentence><sentence id="448">And we said, "No, we really have to be going." </sentence><sentence id="449">And so she gave us a loaf of bread that she happened to have with her, and wished us good speed and we went on our way. </sentence><sentence id="450">And we found out that there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> leaving for <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> that day and so while we waited on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> we saw a <span class="spatial object">train</span> with sealed <span class="spatial object">cars</span> go by. </sentence><sentence id="451">And one of the people who happened to be standing there said that these had contained the people who had been caught on the <span class="dlf">border</span> and were on their way to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">And we thought, you know, we could have been, you know, it was so close. </sentence><sentence id="453">We could have been on one of those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="454">We finally made it back to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">We went to the <span class="building">church</span> and the priest, that same priest whose name we had gotten earlier still wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="456">And we said, "Well, you know, what are we going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="457">And she said...the person who was the housekeeper there said, "Well, we having a visiting priest here, Father Lashora, and he's here to fix the...uh...the <span class="building">clock tower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">Maybe you could...uh...you could talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="459">And so we sought him out, and my mother and I first, and we spill our story and he apparently felt sorry for us and he said, "Look, I have a little <span class="populated place">parish</span> about 10 kilometers from here. </sentence><sentence id="460">It's a little <span class="populated place">mountain parish</span>, and maybe you can come and stay with me until I can figure out what to do with you. </sentence><sentence id="461">And he asked my mother if she could cook. </sentence><sentence id="462">And she said, "Oh yes, I can cook and clean." </sentence><sentence id="463">And he said, "Fine, and you can help out." </sentence><sentence id="464">And my mother said, "What about my husband?" </sentence><sentence id="465">He said, "Oh, you've got a husband?" </sentence><sentence id="466">He seemed a little disappointed, but "Okay, let him come too. </sentence><sentence id="467">Let the husband come too." </sentence><sentence id="468">So he told us how to get there and...uh...we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and then we had to walk up. </sentence><sentence id="469">It was pretty steep. </sentence><sentence id="470">It was...uh...700 meters, so it was quite a good climb, and so we arrived at the <span class="building">parish house</span> and it...on the <span class="env feature">mountaintop</span>, there was only the <span class="building">church</span>, the <span class="building">parish house</span>, and the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">And then all around there were <span class="populated place">villages</span> where the people from the community went and came to Mass and attended as children attended <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">But there was just those three <span class="building">buildings</span> on the <span class="env feature">mountaintop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">So we found the...the <span class="building">Parish house</span> and the priest gave us one of his <span class="interior space">guest room</span> and he said, "Well, we'll try to, you know, to figure out something. </sentence><sentence id="474">Don't worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="475">Just rest for the timebeing." </sentence><sentence id="476">And...uh...he told us, of course, "Stay put. </sentence><sentence id="477">You know, don't go outside and don't even open the <span class="dlf">curtains</span> because people are going to come up to Mass, and we don't want anybody seeing you." </sentence><sentence id="478">So we just stayed in that <span class="interior space">room</span> all day long and met his housekeeper who was not very well disposed toward us. </sentence><sentence id="479">She was a rabid...uh...she wasn't exactly anti-Semitic, but she just loved Marshall Petain, and she just ...uh...and she just didn't like to have three strangers suddenly descending on her and she was worrying about all the extra work that was going to be and so on. </sentence><sentence id="480">And, as a matter of fact, she was so angry that she just refused to work, and so my mother took over. ( </sentence><sentence id="481">Laughing) And there was also a law there: a priest cannot keep people as guests longer than 3 days without informing his bishop. </sentence><sentence id="482">You know, that was a <span class="building">church</span> rule no matter who it was. </sentence><sentence id="483">So after awhile, he said, "Look, you know, I'm having a problem now. </sentence><sentence id="484">We're going to have to figure out...uh...what to do and...at that point my father said, "Look, you've been so nice to us and we really appreciate it, but we really think we ought to be going again and try to get back and cross into <span class="country">Switzerland</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="485">And he wouldn't hear of it. </sentence><sentence id="486">He said, "I have made  inquiries and it's much too dangerous and I...I won't have it. </sentence><sentence id="487">1 won't expose you to that kind of danger. </sentence><sentence id="488">What I have to do is find you a safe place somewhere in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="489">Now to do this, he had to take some of the <span class="populated place">village</span> people into his confidence because, obviously, half these people saw me there. </sentence><sentence id="490">And...uh...so they...some of them were told we were Jewish, but not that we were Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="491">He told we were French from <span class="region">Alce Lorraine</span>, and we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="492">And those people had never seen Jews before in their entire lives, and later on I was told that they wondered what these people looked like and the only thing they had been told was that the Jews had killed Jesus Christ, and then later some little classmates that I had made friends, they told me that they had wondered what those Jews looked like. </sentence><sentence id="493">And he said, "You know, looked just like the rest of us." </sentence><sentence id="494">You know, very, very surprised. </sentence><sentence id="495">And...uh...but you know, so he had to tell some of the <span class="populated place">village</span> people that he also told them, Please, you know, don't tell anybody because this is very dangerous for me and for everybody else." </sentence><sentence id="496">In...in a small <span class="populated place">French village</span>, a priest has a lot of authority and people being very devout, I think he used a little bit of pressure and he told them, you know, threatened them will hell fire and damnation if they would denounce us. </sentence><sentence id="497">And so they figured well, they didn't want to take that chance. </sentence><sentence id="498">He was also well liked and respected so they didn't want to cause trouble for him. </sentence><sentence id="499">So a handful of people knew of our existence. </sentence><sentence id="500">And as their...the local <span class="building">grade school</span> teacher, who was...he was a young guy and his wife, who ran it from a one-room <span class="building">school house</span> there, and he...himself was on the lam, so to speak, because all the young men up to a certain age was supposed to go and do forced labor in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="501">And so those that didn't went <span class="interior space">underground</span> and they were the start of the resistance movement, you know. </sentence><sentence id="502">And so himself, you know, was in danger and he was most helpful with issuing us ration cards and just identity cards and enrolling me in the <span class="building">school system</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="910">Do you want to...to continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: Yal. </sentence><sentence id="914">With the help of the...uh...villagers and priest, found a small <span class="building">house</span> in one of the <span class="populated place">villages</span> in the <span class="env feature">valley</span> and so we...uh, you know, settled in there. </sentence><sentence id="915">Uh...then the priest made me an offer. </sentence><sentence id="916">He had an herd of sheep which he kept to supplement his meager income as a country priest, and he would sell the wool of the sheep and occasionally the meat of the sheep and he also did odd jobs for the villagers. </sentence><sentence id="917">We pay a job and that's why he was there that day fixing a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">And so he said, "Look, I have a little shepherd boy, who has just left. </sentence><sentence id="919">How would you like to keep my herd of sheep in exchange for <span class="interior space">room</span> and <span class="spatial object">board</span>." </sentence><sentence id="920">He said, "This way, you wouldn't be cramped, all of you in the little <span class="building">house</span> and you would have better nourishment. </sentence><sentence id="921">You would be out in the fresh <span class="env feature">air</span>." </sentence><sentence id="922">And so it sounded like a really good idea to me and so I moved up to the <span class="populated place">parish</span> and had a little <span class="interior space">room</span> there and I would just take out the sheep to the <span class="dlf">pasture</span> every morning and bring them <span class="building">home</span> at night when I wasn't in <span class="building">school</span> usually some nights when you go take the sheeps out and I kind of enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="923">By that time I hardly had any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="924">The clothes I had were in rags and any people who happened to venture up  there, they took me for shepherdess, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="925">Couldn't possibly be anything else. </sentence><sentence id="926">And then I was...he turned over to me other chores like helping kids with the catechism, make them recite the catechism, and I would go and I was a little heathen. </sentence><sentence id="927">I was not really given any training in the Jewish faith because my parents were agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="928">I mean they just...they didn't believe in anything and this is a fact that later on I came to regret because I had a sense of...you know a loss of identity. </sentence><sentence id="929">I didn't know who I was. </sentence><sentence id="930">All my little <span class="building">school</span> mates were one thing or another, and I just didn't know where I fitted in. </sentence><sentence id="931">And I had a...a spiritual hunger that somehow was never satisfied and if I had been given some training, it would have helped. </sentence><sentence id="932">So I started out really with a clean slate and I was very much impressed by the Mass, because it was very theatrical and very beautiful and I just really went along with it and I learned all the hymens and I was singing...I learned the entire Mass in Latin. </sentence><sentence id="933">I taught catechism, but I never...I never became a Catholic at the point and what is really laudable is that the priest himself never made any effort to convert us. </sentence><sentence id="934">Never! </sentence><sentence id="935">It never even came up because he felt it wouldn't be the right thing anyway you know. </sentence><sentence id="936">It wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="937">It just...it wouldn't be right. </sentence><sentence id="938">What he was doing was he felt it was his Christian duty, but with any thought of, you know, recompense or anything, he was just doing what he had to do which so many other people in that period did. </sentence><sentence id="939">And I had all the little duties. </sentence><sentence id="940">They gave...they put me in charge of ringing the <span class="building">church</span> bells and going to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> nearby, watering <span class="spatial object">graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="941">I enjoyed that life. </sentence><sentence id="942">It was the life on the <span class="dlf">pasture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="943">It was close to <span class="env feature">nature</span>. </sentence><sentence id="944">It was you know, as commonplace, you know. </sentence><sentence id="945">I developed a deep love for..for <span class="env feature">nature</span>, and never really...uh...felt good about living in <span class="populated place">cities</span> ever since then. </sentence><sentence id="946">Uh...So I had my <span class="interior space">room</span> board and the priest shared everything he had with me. </sentence><sentence id="947">All the food, and so I wasn't too badly off, and he had a...he had some <span class="env feature">fruit trees</span> and he had food and he had a <span class="dlf">vegetable garden</span> and later on, he turned over to us little <span class="dlf">plot</span> of <span class="env feature">ground</span> where we could cultivate our own vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="948">And my parents were still <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>...no...in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, but then some trouble developed. </sentence><sentence id="949">Uh...There was a <span class="building">mill</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span> and where people brought grain to be <span class="env feature">ground</span> and the grain was then made into oil. </sentence><sentence id="950">And somebody had broken in during the night and stolen the oil and so next thing we knew, the <span class="populated place">village</span> was crawling with police again. </sentence><sentence id="951">And, you know, the __ got really edgy and the...you know, they questioned us and we just got off, but it was...it was touchy for us, for my parents to stay there after that. </sentence><sentence id="952">And so when the priest heard what had happened, that things had deteriorated, he decided that they had to...they had to leave and he tried to find them another place to stay and he just...there was just nothing there...pretty sparsely populated and there was... So he decided...finally, he made them a proposition. </sentence><sentence id="953">He was a little bit embarrassed but he said, "Look, I have an unused <span class="interior space">bar room</span> at the bottom of my...on the <span class="building">parish house</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, <span class="interior space">sub basement</span>, and if you could be content with that, I would give it to you and you could be safe there." </sentence><sentence id="954">And my parents said, "Sure," you know. </sentence><sentence id="955">So they showed them <span class="interior space">bar room</span> and he gave them a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, an iron <span class="spatial object">bed stand</span>, and he put in a little <span class="spatial object">wood stove</span> and a <span class="spatial object">table</span> and <span class="spatial object">chair</span> and that was about it, but it was extremely small. </sentence><sentence id="956">They had no <span class="dlf">windows</span> and just one <span class="dlf">door</span> leading out to the...to the <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and the <span class="env feature">woods</span> surrounding there. </sentence><sentence id="957">And basically, for the next 3 years until the end of the war...uh...my parents stayed in the <span class="interior space">boiler room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="958">Never left, except on very rare occasions to go to the nearby <span class="env feature">woods</span> because...uh...the only way they could cook and heat the little <span class="interior space">room</span> was to put some wood in the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> so that the...the priest showed them how to go and cut down <span class="env feature">trees</span> so my father would go on a regular basis and just saw down <span class="env feature">trees</span> and chop them up for wood. </sentence><sentence id="959">And then the priest also taught my father how to  look for edible mushrooms. </sentence><sentence id="960">And it really was a good supplement to a diet because they were high in protein and there wasn't much else around to eat, so that was one of the main staples in those days and occasionally he would slaughter a sheep and then we would have...he would share some meat with us and he did give us a little <span class="dlf">plot</span> of <span class="env feature">ground</span> so eventually I planted a little <span class="interior space">vegetable garden</span> and we had some fresh vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="961">Uh... as a child could go out because you know, I wouldn't be noticed so I occasionally went to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> to buy a few staples that were rare, able to buy. </sentence><sentence id="962">And... uh...my mother occasionally went down when it was safe and in exchange for say a dozen eggs, she would do some sewing for the people of the <span class="populated place">village</span> and make some hats, you know, or assist them. </sentence><sentence id="963">But that was only very rarely, because most of the time it just wasn't safe. </sentence><sentence id="964">The other thing was that we didn't have any shoes. </sentence><sentence id="965">My mother had risked somehow kept...I don't how she did it, but she had kept a pair of old ski boots from the good days in <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="966">And my shoes wore out, so I wound up wearing hers but then if I was wearing shoes, she couldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="967">So we kind of took turns doing that. </sentence><sentence id="968">And so I would say that although they did go out occasionally, most of the time they were confined...they were confined to this little <span class="interior space">room</span> where I...and I attended...I attended the <span class="building">local school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="969">And I was...I was 12 years old at the time, 13...going on 13, and I was supposed to take a test, a national test which signals really the end of <span class="building">grade school</span> for most farm kids. </sentence><sentence id="970">After that point, they just stop and... However, even though I did all the preparatory work for the test, the teacher felt that it would be too risky for me to actually go because you had to go to the...uh...you know, nearby big <span class="populated place">town</span> and you had to fill out forms and you had...uh...you know prove who you were. </sentence><sentence id="971">You had to have birth certificates. </sentence><sentence id="972">And so he decided no, I wasn't going to take the test. </sentence><sentence id="973">But he...he couldn't tell the other kids why, and so they thought that I couldn't take the test because I was too dumb. </sentence><sentence id="974">And at that age, it hurts you know. </sentence><sentence id="975">They were making fun of me and started calling me names. </sentence><sentence id="976">And then some of them started acting really nasty and called me dirty Jews and one little boy beat me up and then I...when I told the priest about it, he put a stop to that, you know, and there wasn't too much problem...uh...after that. </sentence><sentence id="977">Uh... There was another problem. </sentence><sentence id="978">The...uh...the priest had a nephew, his sister's son...uh... son who was in the French Miless, and that was a paramilitary organization, which in many instances was worse than the Gestapo in their cruelty. </sentence><sentence id="979">They were just totally ruthless. </sentence><sentence id="980">Now the nephew, who lived in a nearby <span class="populated place">town</span>, occasionally came to visit his uncle and there was no way that he could keep his presence from the nephew and somehow you know he found out about it, and when he did he immediately threatened...he renounced his uncle and us to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="981">And....uh...the priest said, "Okay, now if you do this, I will denounce you to the resistance which by that time was coming into its own and was getting quite strong. </sentence><sentence id="982">Right across the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, we could look at the famous <span class="region">plateau</span>, the <span class="env feature">Glerair</span>, where whole bunch, you know, resistance fighters were killed, and they were all around us in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="983">They would come down at night and <span class="populated place">villages</span> would feed them so they were a very real presence. </sentence><sentence id="984">And then later on there was scrimmages. </sentence><sentence id="985">You know, they would put <span class="dlf">road blocks</span>, prevent <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> from going by and they were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="986">So the threat of turning him over to the resistance was real enough that he held off from doing anything, but he vowed that, you know, he would come back and have his day. </sentence><sentence id="987">So we...after...after that, the priest and us too, you know, we...we lived in constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="988">Uh...and then, you know, the Gestapo...we, I mean the German troops were all over <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> and every time I went there I...I had to...a couple old friends I made there, and every time I went down  there, I...you know, I could see them and I really felt uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="989">I just couldn't, you know, get away fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="990">And we had very little news from the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="991">The only thing was that the...uh...the housekeeper had a...a radio in her <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and we listened to the BBC so we ....uh...and sometimes to ...uh...the newscast from <span class="country">Switzerland</span> so we did get some news. </sentence><sentence id="992">My father...my father, having been a journalist, was especially deprived, you know, not being able to have access to any kind of a news. </sentence><sentence id="993">And we started hearing about the advance of the Russians and we had a map and we put pins there and so we knew that our deliverance was...was getting close. </sentence><sentence id="994">I mean we knew that much. </sentence><sentence id="995">And I think the one thing I remember from that period was that they had a code word for the landing in <span class="populated place">Normandy</span>, and it was...uh...a friend will come tonight, and that one just absolutely stuck in my memory and the other one was Aunt Julie ate chicken for lunch twice, you know, and just... think as long as I live I'll remember that. </sentence><sentence id="996">And so, you know, we were...we had a fearing that we would be rescued, but then things started getting really bad again. </sentence><sentence id="997">You know, there were maydays and they would loose some <span class="region">territory</span> and my father became very, very pessimistic, and he started talking about our future, always in the conditional...if we survive, and he started telling me now, if you should be separated from your mother and father, I want you to try to contact this person and that person and he just...you know, he hadn't totally given up hope but he...he was getting depressed. </sentence><sentence id="998">And...uh...there were, you know, there were more incidents of run-ins with the...uh...with the Gestapo and the resistance movement which, for us, it was dangerous because they were always...they were always crawling around so that we had a...a kind of prearranged signal. </sentence><sentence id="999">Whenever there was some...uh...German troops nearby, somebody would give the alert and then the young teacher who was also in danger, and my parents would climb up to the <span class="building">clock tower</span> and there was a bunch of hay there and they would just hide in the hay until the "all clear" was sounded. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And...uh...the priest had also by that time taken in another young man who was trying to get away from forced labor in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1001">He was that age, so he was not only hiding my parents, but he was hiding this young man who was not Jewish, but he just didn't wanta go to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Uh...Finally...uh...one time, we...we were...bunch of us, with the teacher and I, were sitting outside and we saw <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> coming up the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> and all these men in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And we thought, "Oh, this is it," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1004">"This is it!" </sentence><sentence id="1005">And we started...I gave the alert and we all ran back into the <span class="building">house</span> and I alerted my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1006">They barred a <span class="dlf">door</span> and....uh...late...and then we...I just went and stayed with my parents <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and we...we...we were sure it was the Gestapo coming up and the German troops. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And then later, we heard them leave and then the next thing we knew, the housekeeper knocked on our <span class="dlf">door</span> and she was in tears and she said, "No, it's not the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It's...uh...the priest's nephew and his family. </sentence><sentence id="1009">They were caught by the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1010">They had torched their <span class="building">house</span> and his wife and baby had been forced to flee so he had just come, dropped his family off at the priest, and left and later on, he was shot by the Resistance." </sentence><sentence id="1011">So here were all these...all these people...uh...being with us, but ...uh...you know, when she first knocked on our <span class="dlf">door</span> and she said, "Don't be afraid." </sentence><sentence id="1012">For some reason, I...I was more afraid than I have been so. </sentence><sentence id="1013">But at least, you know, it wasn't...it wasn't what we thought. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And...uh...then...uh... we started seeing RAS, <span class="spatial object">RAS planes</span> going overhead and we knew they were on their bomb Curran. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So we knew that, you know, something had to happen soon. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And then one morning, that young man who the priest had also taken in, pounded on my <span class="dlf">door</span> and said, "Eva, they have landed. </sentence><sentence id="1017">They have landed." </sentence><sentence id="1018">And I, you know,  this must have been the happiest day of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And, of course, that was only...that was only the beginning, and it took quite awhile before all of <span class="country">France</span> was liberated and...uh...the part where we were in and but finally...finally came to that at the point where we, you know, where we knew it was over. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Unfortunately, by then the news...we had been able to communicate with some of our friends, with relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1021">We...we didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I had a...uh...my father had a sister and...uh...her sister had a daughter in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and we had...we didn't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1023">We didn't find out til several years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1024">But we got the news that my grandmother, my father's mother who was in her 70s, had been taken away in the middle of the night and taken to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> where she succumbed shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And my grandfather, whom they had not taken at that point with all the, you know, excitement, everything, had a stroke and...uh...he remained at <span class="building">home</span> as I was told later for several weeks and he was totally out of his mind and, you know, and he never really regained full consciousness and wind up dying too. </sentence><sentence id="1026">So later on, my cousin submitted both their names to the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> where they are on that roll with the rest of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1027">So that was a terrible blow for my father, and I remember he went out in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and just wanted to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="1028">He just didn't want to talk to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And I know that later on, I had really, you know, guilt feelings about that, about surviving. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Cause I loved my grandmother and I said, "Oh why...why was I...why was I left to live and...and not her," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And I really felt guilty about being alive, and it took me years...years to identify that feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I didn't have it in concrete form. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I just knew I felt guilty and then I finally, you know, came to terms with it, but it took many years before I actually came to terms with that. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So basically, we were free to go, but the priest had gotten attached to us and he wouldn't let us go.(Laughing) And he said, "Look, where are you go? </sentence><sentence id="1035">You don't have a <span class="building">home</span> to go to? </sentence><sentence id="1036">What... You don't have any money? </sentence><sentence id="1037">You don't have a job? </sentence><sentence id="1038">What are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1039">So he talked my father into staying a little while longer. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And he sent me to <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> and I attended the <span class="building">Letsa</span> for...for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And then finally my father, you know, he was getting restless and he went ahead to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to see what he could do and he did find some kind of work there and a place for us to stay, a furnished <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And so we did rejoin him and it was a very, you know, it was hard to part with the priest. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And but at that point, you know, he promised...he made us promise that we would come back to at least to see him on a vacation and we did, and...and we kept that promise, but I also had made a vow to myself and that was to tell the world what he had done for us. </sentence><sentence id="1044">I vowed that some day the whole world would know, and I did. </sentence><sentence id="1045">It take many years, but it came to pass. </sentence><sentence id="1046">But finally my father said he had found a place to live, so we came...we went back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and we joined him and things were almost worse than they had been...uh...at the...at the beginning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1047">There was absolutely no food. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And we depended on care rations from people in the <span class="country">United States</span> and clothes that the people who had succeeded in going overhead was sending us. </sentence><sentence id="1049">There was no heat, you know, and I became very ill because of all the...uh...being undernourished and had and pleurisy and I was ill for 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And then my parents gave me a choice. </sentence><sentence id="1051">They said, "Look, you still...our life is just half over, but you have your...1 was barely 16 at the time, and you still have your whole life in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="1052">So you decide. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Do you want to stay in <span class="country">France</span> or do you want to go to <span class="country">United States</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="1054">And, of course, I didn't have to think about it very long. " </sentence><sentence id="1055">I want to go to the <span class="country">United States</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1056">Because I heard wonderful <span class="dlf">streets</span> and, you know, the <span class="dlf">streets</span> are paved with gold and everything which was  Just, you know, I had by that time seen some Hollywood movies and so naturally I.... was no question in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1057">They put our name on the quota in 1946, and it took 2 years for our names to get to the head of the quota and but by the time they called us, we just had to leave....period...you know. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Two days and go. </sentence><sentence id="1059">We...you had to have a sponsor, somebody over on the other side guaranteeing that you would not become a welfare case and affidavits and...and we had...my mother had a brother who <span class="building">station</span> who gave the affidavit in...in...so that was...so we...we came over by...by <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Nine day trip. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Landed in <span class="dlf">New York Harbor</span> in May of 1948. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: Well, it was bad because we were taken to a _____ <span class="building">shelter</span> first, although my uncle couldn't have put us, he put us in a <span class="building">shelter</span>, and then his wife, fearful that we might cost too much money, put my mother and me to work in a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1220">So this was our introduction to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Was not too pleasant and...uh...we didn't stay there very long. ( </sentence><sentence id="1222">Laughing) My mother's health started breaking down almost as soon as we got there. </sentence><sentence id="1223">She developed high blood pressure. </sentence><sentence id="1224">She had a series of strokes, and so really from that time on she was almost an invalid, very, you know, almost not able to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1225">We..the only place we could find was in a <span class="building">tenement</span> on the <span class="region">upper east side</span>, you know, <span class="region">east side</span> bordering on <span class="populated place">Harlem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And...uh...my father had trouble finding work. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Of course, I didn't speak English so I had to start all over again learning. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I was 18 at the time, so I did..I did learn it, and...uh...immediately it was... really I had to go to work to...to support the family. </sentence><sentence id="1229">But I had no skills. </sentence><sentence id="1230">You know, I had no work experience, and I had to do a bit of fudging. </sentence><sentence id="1231">I looked to the want ads, and I saw somebody wanting a bookkeeper and I had never done bookkeeping, but I figured, "Okay, well." </sentence><sentence id="1232">Anyway, it happened to be a <span class="building">publishing company</span> and I guess I convinced him to hire me and they soon found out that I really didn't know anything about bookkeeping, but they felt sorry for me, I guess, and they kept me and I stayed there for 5 years, and sorting mail and doing really menial jobs, but it was a beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And...uh...37 dollars a week.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1275">A: There is one thing, a kind of a happy footnote that I had vowed to...uh...you know, tell the world about the priest that saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And then I found out only 3 years old that the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> actually solicited testimonies from survivors, like me, about their rescuers and I was put in touch with some friends that I feel had kept in touch with in <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> and I went through all the <span class="dlf">channels</span>, submitting testimony and sent it off there and took it 18 months before I had a reply and they finally...uh...did inform me by letter that our priest had been accorded the honor of just among the <span class="country">nations</span> that he would a have a <span class="env feature">tree</span> planted in his name in the Garden of the Just at the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span>, and that he would be awarded a medal of the Just. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And then the people who knew him in <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> and others...and some of the members of the Jewish community in <span class="populated place">Annecy</span> organized a commemorative ceremony which they're having from time to time recognize people who had been honored by the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span>, and so they had a ceremony on May 6th and for...for Father Lashora who was our priest. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Father Lashora died in 1959, as a matter of fact, so this was all post humorously, and it was for him and for other priests who had been recognized only one of whom was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And they had 400...400 people present there. </sentence><sentence id="1280">They had representatives from the...from the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span>, the Minister of <span class="country">Israel</span>, representatives from the local Archbishop and the Minister of <span class="populated place">Annecy</span>, and the mayor, and it was a truly ecumenical kind of gathering. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And then we...the current priest of that <span class="building">parish</span> now accepted the medal in the name of the priest and the medal...on the front of the front of the medal it says to Father Lashora, from the grateful Jewish people, and on the back it says, "He who saves a life saves all of humanity." </sentence><sentence id="1282">And then we...we decided that we put the medal in a glass case and put it in his old <span class="building">parish house</span> to be preserved forever. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And I was invited to give...you know to just briefly tell the story as the Father priest was involved in our rescue, and with that I felt that I had finally given him the proper recognition that he deserved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
