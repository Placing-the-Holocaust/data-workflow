<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What happened when...how did your life change? </sentence><sentence id="51">when the Nazis invaded <span class="country">Europe</span> (sic), what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: My...there was a lot of change. </sentence><sentence id="55">My oldest brother was in the service, and he fought on the front, at the <span class="dlf">Grebbeberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was very difficult because when the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> capitulated we didn't know if my brother was alive or dead. </sentence><sentence id="57">Every day in the <span class="populated place">village</span> there was news of other soldiers who had fought at the front and who had survived. </sentence><sentence id="58">But we never received any news whether my brother was still alive, and everyone was very sad and worried. </sentence><sentence id="59"> My father went every day to ask about his son, and every day there was news of this one who had returned, or that one who had returned but no news of the oldest son, and finally my father said I am going to go look for him. </sentence><sentence id="60">So then he spent three days searching in <span class="building">barracks</span> and in <span class="building">schools</span> and the war was already six weeks past, six weeks over. </sentence><sentence id="61">After...... After three days my father found him. </sentence><sentence id="62">He was not wounded, he was alive, but he was very apathetic and didn't quite know where he was or who he was. </sentence><sentence id="63">He found him in a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And brought him <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">That's how the beginning of the misery. </sentence><sentence id="66">That's how the war started. </sentence><sentence id="67">In the beginning it was a little bit difficult but in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> it was fairly peaceful still. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: What was it like every day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: My brother worked everyday at the <span class="dlf">farm</span> and slowly but surely he recovered. </sentence><sentence id="85">Daily life was fairly quiet and normal at first in a little <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">You didn't notice so much. </sentence><sentence id="87">Then they started rounding up people. </sentence><sentence id="88">At first they took doctors and and people who had done something wrong in their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="89">My uncle was also a doctor and was picked up. </sentence><sentence id="90">At that point, people went on strike here and there. </sentence><sentence id="91">In 1942, in the beginning of 1942, they even picked up my father because he had not delivered milk as he was supposed to. </sentence><sentence id="92">That was his way of striking. </sentence><sentence id="93">At seven in the morning, the Germans came with a big <span class="spatial object">truck</span> [used for raids] and all around our place they they were were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="94">And took my father along. </sentence><sentence id="95">I helped my father get dressed. </sentence><sentence id="96">He was still in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> because he was a little sick and he didn't have (his) papers. </sentence><sentence id="97">My mother was walking in the <span class="interior space">hall</span> with the mayor of our <span class="populated place">town</span>, because the mayor had come along because he had to point out the people who were striking because the Germans didn't know where they were living. </sentence><sentence id="98">He was also restraining my brother who was very angry because after all he had been in the war and wanted to attack them. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I was in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> helping my father get dressed and getting his things together. </sentence><sentence id="100">He didn't want to take his wallet and he didn't want to put his coat on but the Germans said he had to take his coat because it is cold on that open <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">So then there was a panic because he left without his ID papers. </sentence><sentence id="102">And we were afraid if he if he didn't have his ID papers he would never get back. </sentence><sentence id="103">Then I biked out. </sentence><sentence id="104">I got on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and rode out of the <span class="populated place">village</span> where they were picking up other people, with his ID papers. </sentence><sentence id="105">I found my father at the <span class="spatial object">German car</span> and gave him his identification papers even though the Germans yelled at me that I was not to go near the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and I succeeded in giving it to him. </sentence><sentence id="106">Then I went <span class="building">home</span> but first I stopped at the <span class="building">church</span> and there I burst in to tears. </sentence><sentence id="107">I went <span class="building">home</span> to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="108">And then this <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was standing at the neighbor's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">He also had a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">I thought my goodness, now the neighbor will also be picked up but that wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="111">They were simply asking the neighbors to keep an eye on us. </sentence><sentence id="112">To make sure that nothing would be taken away and that no livestock would be removed and  it was the neighbor's responsibility to see to that. </sentence><sentence id="113">It was a terribly difficult day. </sentence><sentence id="114">Everyone thought my father would never come back. </sentence><sentence id="115">He was brought to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, but I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="116">01:14: There they took everything away from him. </sentence><sentence id="117">He didn't have very much with him but what he had they took away. </sentence><sentence id="118">But later that same evening we got news that he was on his way <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">But we have no idea why they let him go like that. </sentence><sentence id="120">Sometimes we think the Dutch Nazi Party (NSB) put in a good word for him. </sentence><sentence id="121">Then he told us that in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> they made him read lists of people who had been shot. </sentence><sentence id="122">His predecessors... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="164">Can I ask something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: He had to read lists of names of people who had been shot as an example to him. </sentence><sentence id="168">But he refused. ( </sentence><sentence id="169">Laughter) He was very stiff-necked and stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="170">He said I cannot read. </sentence><sentence id="171">So he didn't have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="172">So then he was allowed to go <span class="building">home</span> but he had the audacity to say, well, I don't have any money to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">He he thought maybe they should bring him <span class="building">home</span> again but he somehow got money and was able to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">We were over-joyed that he was <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="175">The whole <span class="populated place">village</span> had thought he would never return. </sentence><sentence id="176">Later on, boys were picked up from the <span class="dlf">street</span>, young men. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="177"> 01:17: </sentence></p><p><sentence id="178"> They had to go to <span class="country">Germany</span> to work for the Wehrmacht in some way and they went into hiding, <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">That started the period of putting people into hiding and we, from periodically, got one hiding person or another, one fugitive or another. </sentence><sentence id="180">One of them got sick and we brought him to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and we never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="181">Later on we had a young man from <span class="populated place">Enkhuizen</span>, that's in our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, in our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">We also got a teacher from <span class="populated place">Hoorn</span> who was working in the resistance and had to disappear from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="183">He would ask if he could stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="184">A few months later he asked if his son could stay with us who was at that time in hiding in <span class="populated place">Zaandijk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">For three months he sat in a <span class="interior space">attic room</span> which he never left. </sentence><sentence id="186">He went crazy. </sentence><sentence id="187">After that he came to stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="188">He was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="189">Sometimes he spent whole days in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">Eventually he recovered somewhat and we urged him to get out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and to walk outside where other fugitives, were able to walk freely in the <span class="region">country side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">We put them to work. </sentence><sentence id="192">They started to help out a little bit, because doing nothing all day long is very difficult. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="193"> They also walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, but they generally stayed close to the <span class="building">house</span> and our <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">In the fall of "42, Laura came to us, or maybe it was "43. </sentence><sentence id="195">I don't remember the year exactly. </sentence><sentence id="196">After the war we didn't talk about it very much anymore. </sentence><sentence id="197">Laura was brought to us on a Sunday afternoon by two men on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> from <span class="populated place">Hoorn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">The two men were from  the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and asked us if we could take a child. </sentence><sentence id="199">Well, we already had several people hiding in our <span class="building">house</span> and I liked children very much, so we thought there was <span class="interior space">room</span> for one more. </sentence><sentence id="200">And then that was Laura. </sentence><sentence id="201">That was Laura. </sentence><sentence id="202">She was very sad and cried quite a bit because she had already experienced quite a lot. </sentence><sentence id="203">Later on my sister came with her oldest daughter, her little daughter who was a little bit younger than Laura, but we didn't really know how old Laura was until after the war. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="204"> 01:23: </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205"> She was a bit younger. </sentence><sentence id="206">Quickly they started to play and by evening they were having a lot of fun. </sentence><sentence id="207">My father said to my sister, why don't you leave <span class="populated place">Riet</span> here for a while so that the little girl will get used to us and have some to play with......they can play together. </sentence><sentence id="208">It worked out very well and soon she began to feel at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">She had experienced so much she was still quite fearful and in the beginning especially at night she often woke up crying and screaming. </sentence><sentence id="210">She had it difficult. </sentence><sentence id="211">I slept in the same <span class="interior space">room</span> with her. </sentence><sentence id="212">We always did it that way, and when she laid down, I always had to hold her hand. ( </sentence><sentence id="213">Laughter) Well, my niece had to leave again because she was in <span class="building">school</span>, and she played with children in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="214"> 01:25: </sentence></p><p><sentence id="215"> Once in a while Riet and Dick were here with me. </sentence><sentence id="216">They would come and play. </sentence><sentence id="217">For the rest I, we all thought it went very well with Laura. </sentence><sentence id="218">She was very happy and cheerful afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="219">And we loved her very much. </sentence><sentence id="220">And Laura loved us. </sentence><sentence id="221">Every week I wrote a card to her parents, so-called, because we really didn't have any idea where her father and mother were. </sentence><sentence id="222">I had to write it and Laura would dictate. </sentence><sentence id="223">No card every came back. </sentence><sentence id="224">So it was kind of unnecessary and so the war went on. </sentence><sentence id="225">Laura went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">The <span class="building">school</span> was informed they knew it and took care of her. </sentence><sentence id="227">The <span class="building">school</span> was fairly safe although there were searches at <span class="building">school</span>, but they said it would be OK to send her. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was too difficult to keep a child hidden all day long, completely hidden. </sentence><sentence id="229">Even in our own family we had several nieces and nephews who who sort of looked like her and even had dark hair. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="230">Everything ran very nicely and evenly. ( </sentence><sentence id="231">laughter) She did well in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">There were not that many difficulties any more. </sentence><sentence id="233">Of course once in a while there were Germans in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and we would get the news of that and then we would just go on out our <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="234">I would visit my......1 would visit my sister or go somewhere else and would take Laura along. </sentence><sentence id="235">The <span class="interior space">underground</span> took care of it and saw to it that we got food coupons for Laura and the other people we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="236">She was of course afraid of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="237">When she saw a German she would say, he's not going to do anything to me is he? </sentence><sentence id="238">One night the Germans were in front of our <span class="dlf">door</span> and that was very scary. </sentence><sentence id="239">All in their uniforms with their boots and then all the people who were hiding in our <span class="building">house</span> had to lay low. </sentence><sentence id="240">I had....... had to crawl through the <span class="building">house</span> on my knees to warn the adult young men who were hiding of the danger but Laura said, they're not going to do anything to me are they? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="241">And, but it was hard to hide her. </sentence><sentence id="242"> I said just crawl under the <span class="spatial object">blankets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">They won't do anything to you and that's what she did. </sentence><sentence id="244">I think she was with us about two years. </sentence><sentence id="245">But we didn't know if her father and mother were still alive or where they were or if they still lived. </sentence><sentence id="246">When she came to us, she said her name was Laura Cruck (ph), but that was not her name and she didn't want that name. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="247">She wanted to be called <span class="building">Schouten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">So she was Laura Schouten. </sentence><sentence id="249">We thought it was fine. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="250">The the war caused many difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="251">There were more strikes. </sentence><sentence id="252">Here and there people were picked up and deported. </sentence><sentence id="253">In that same way, in our <span class="populated place">village</span>, a gentleman was taken and all the Jews he was hiding in his <span class="building">house</span> and we never saw any of them again. </sentence><sentence id="254">In the <span class="populated place">villages</span> here and there people would be shot and <span class="dlf">farms</span> would be plundered or set on fire. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="255"> It got very scary. </sentence><sentence id="256">But somehow our <span class="dlf">farm</span> stayed safe and many people came from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> to ask for milk , food, potatoes and grain. </sentence><sentence id="257">At night there was alway after we had milked, there was always a long <span class="dlf">line</span> of people asking for a liter or two of milk. </sentence><sentence id="258">We also had to set apart part of our <span class="region">land</span> for the Germans and give food, part of our crop such as beans or grain, my father had to give to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="259">We had to grow kidneybeans for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="260">My father sold all the beans himself to people who were happy to have them. </sentence><sentence id="261">For the same price that they would get from the German army or that they would have to pay in the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">In a few days everything was sold out and as far as the Wehrmacht was concerned the harvest had failed. </sentence><sentence id="263">This was our way of striking or resisting. </sentence><sentence id="264">One night a gentleman came to our <span class="building">house</span> and asked if he could sleep over, that he wouldn't need any food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="265"> 01:36: Most people who came to the <span class="building">house</span> asked for food. </sentence><sentence id="266">Once he was inside he was quite a big man. </sentence><sentence id="267">Inside of his coat he had a Jewish star. </sentence><sentence id="268">He asked if he could sleep in the <span class="interior space">hayloft</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="269">He said, don't worry, I have my own food. </sentence><sentence id="270">When he took his food out of his pocket it was three large carrots and that was his food. </sentence><sentence id="271">So then we had to cook some food for him so he would have something to eat, but the next morning he took took off and we never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="272">Every day more people would come from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> with <span class="spatial object">carts</span> and with <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> asking if we had anything for them to eat or to get some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="273">It got more and more difficult, these people who came from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> with their <span class="spatial object">hand carts</span> on barefeet, very very thin and sick. </sentence><sentence id="274">They were, they were all...they would return with sick people in the <span class="spatial object">carts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">Sometimes they were dead. </sentence><sentence id="276">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody. </sentence><sentence id="277">Once in a while the resistance would shoot somebody, either a German or a Dutch person who had betrayed an other Dutch person, and then there would be terrible retaliation and several people in the <span class="populated place">village</span> would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="278">They would grab a few people in the <span class="populated place">village</span> as prisoners and they would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="279">Leaflets would be thrown from <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">One time a nephew was walking in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, in an other <span class="populated place">village</span> and he was met by some Germans. </sentence><sentence id="281">He had some of these leaflets in his pockets and they took him and we  never heard a word of from him again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="282"> My uncle who also had, was also hiding two young men had his <span class="building">house</span> raided and he and the two young men were also taken along and taken prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="283">He he spent three months in <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and later he was brought to <span class="populated place">Vught</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">Those two people who he was hiding did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="285">My uncle was supposed to be sent on transport to <span class="country">Germany</span> but the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> were on strike and so he didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="286">So in the end he survived. </sentence><sentence id="287">Well, then the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="288">The Germans capitulated. </sentence><sentence id="289">But even that same day two boys who were in the resistance in our <span class="populated place">village</span> were still shot. </sentence><sentence id="290">The whole <span class="populated place">village</span> was in an uproar that some, that just at the end two more were shot. </sentence><sentence id="291">We said to Laura, now your mommy and daddy will come soon, but of course we really didn't know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="292"> Actually they were only a few <span class="populated place">villages</span> away from us in a little tiny <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">I thought how can they hide people in that little tiny <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">One week after the war, on a Saturday, they came to our <span class="building">house</span> to see Laura. </sentence><sentence id="295">We told Laura here comes your mother and father, but Laura didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="296">She didn't know what she was seeing, that she was seeing her father and mother again. </sentence><sentence id="297">And she didn't want to have anything to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="298">Which was terribly sad for her father and mother. </sentence><sentence id="299">Of course we were happy because it showed that she had had a good life with us. </sentence><sentence id="300">They wanted to go back to <span class="populated place">Berkhout</span>, where they had been hidden that same evening and take Laura with them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="301">Laura did not want to come along. </sentence><sentence id="302">So I took Laura on the back, on the back of my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I went along to <span class="populated place">Birkhout</span> to that little <span class="building">house</span> where they were hidden. </sentence><sentence id="303">But she stayed very close to me and the minute I took a step she would stay right with me. </sentence><sentence id="304">So then I suggested to the father and mother that they should come along with me until Laura had gotten use to them a little bit again. </sentence><sentence id="305">So that's what they did and we all bicycled back to my <span class="building">house</span> and the father and mother stayed with us for a week. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was of course very difficult but it went a little better. </sentence><sentence id="307">The father wanted to go back to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> as quickly as possible to see what he could find. </sentence><sentence id="308">To look after his <span class="building">butcher shop</span> and his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">He got a <span class="building">house</span> there and so they left for <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">Laura was very homesick in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">She thought everything at our <span class="building">house</span> was better and the food more delicious than it was in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">She had at...with us she had her friends and everyone knew her. </sentence><sentence id="313">So she went to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> but in the summer vacation she was allowed to come and stay with us again. </sentence><sentence id="314">Well, she agreed to that and she went along to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and when the big vacation came, she came and stayed with us again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="315"> She thought everything at our <span class="building">house</span> was better and on her birthday, the 26th of August, her parents came to get her to celebrate her birthday. </sentence><sentence id="316">But Laura said to her parents,
