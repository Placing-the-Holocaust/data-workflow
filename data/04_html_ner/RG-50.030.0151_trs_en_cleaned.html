<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: I guess happened many things, like in the all world and uh I was very young, uh young boy at the time. </sentence><sentence id="194">But already I remember very well in my family, my father and I guess in that period was "33, "34, was the first time a radio in our <span class="building">house</span> and we (were) not wery rich, I guess, like middle class, we didn't have a radio, so he bought a second-hand radio. </sentence><sentence id="195">And we start to listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">And we started at that time to hear more and more about <span class="country">Germany</span>, about Hitler, about what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="197">So the people start to, to talk and I heard in our family, talking with some friends, talking about what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And people already become to be anxious about what the future will bring because we had some feelings, not to I say we, we kids, but Jewish people said something's starting to, to, to change. </sentence><sentence id="199">It's a quietness and it's a quiet life which was before over there. </sentence><sentence id="200">And if I remember again was a lot of articles in the press at the time about the events. </sentence><sentence id="201">And uh, was some kind of discussion now and people start to talk more, but was only talk at this time about <span class="country">Germany</span>, about Hitler, about the situation in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: And when the war actually broke out, what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Now we come to the period of time when I guess I remember most about what happened and to my recollection I have more lively now, you know. </sentence><sentence id="214">And matter of fact, even before, before the war started, the war started in "41, if I remember June, I say 21, "41, the war started, the German started to cross the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>'s <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">But before "41 already the situation was very tense. </sentence><sentence id="216">Number one, in "39, "38, when Hitler start to act aggressively and to enter <span class="country">Austria</span> in "38 and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> if I remember, we were more anxious and many people, many Jewish people, start to think to emigrate from <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And our lot of <span class="populated place">town</span> is the young organization over there, and uh, always uh Zionist uh movement try to convince people to immigrate to <span class="country">Palestine</span> even before the war. </sentence><sentence id="218">By the events that happening before the war, in "38, "39, the international events start to show to the people, specially to the Jewish people, to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to our <span class="dlf">borders</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">But between or besides the international conditions, uh domestic conditions change. </sentence><sentence id="220">Some fascist organizations like <span class="building">Iron Guard</span> and other organizations start to become more, more aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="221">And they start to take action against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="222">They start on the <span class="dlf">street</span> to, to beat some Jewish people in "39 with some, some, some uh big uh, uh grow of this organization encouraged by Germans, by other groups. </sentence><sentence id="223">So in "30, "39 the situation start to be very tense for all the people. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I have to, to tell you no probably and  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I'm sure that when the German went to <span class="country">Poland</span> and occupied in September, I don't know, September Ist if I recall, beginning of September, we heard by the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, but after two, three days already the Polish troop start to run from <span class="country">Poland</span> and to come toward <span class="region">Moldavia</span> to <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">And one day, one morning, I remember like now, it was four in the morning, we heard a large noise, big noise on the, my <span class="dlf">street</span>, and like a big column of <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> or heavy <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> start to moving. </sentence><sentence id="226">Unusual noise for a small <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">So everybody went out. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was four, five in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="229">And we saw some columns of <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, loaded with uh Polish soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="230">Dirty, uh thirsty, very very uh tired, like escaped from, from the war. </sentence><sentence id="231">And the first thing they always asked for <span class="env feature">water</span>, some food and was a very very depressed situation. </sentence><sentence id="232">It would depress anybody. </sentence><sentence id="233">And to know for yourself as the first time what the war means. </sentence><sentence id="234">We saw on our <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and was in'39, and uh the Polish troops start to, to get out of the <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span>, ask for more food. </sentence><sentence id="235">They start to trade something, want it to be free, and there's long story what happens uh Polish troop. </sentence><sentence id="236">But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh, in the middle of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">So we understand that the situation aggravate and aggravate more and more. </sentence><sentence id="238">So even before the war started in "40 other international events and domestic events starting to, to, to uh, to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations become more powerful. </sentence><sentence id="239">And the political situation start to uh, to be very tense and as we know, in "40 and beginning on "41 was a big change. </sentence><sentence id="240">The king was take over from the throne, was uh expelled out, and uh General Antonescu the power and installed a very fasciest dictatorship together with <span class="building">Iron Guard</span>, which was very extremist, but after the war start a fight for many reasons, not now the place to go to tell between <span class="building">Iron Guard</span> and General Antonescu. </sentence><sentence id="241">And General Antonescu become very powerful and in charge of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="242">And he start uh, "40, end of the "40, beginning of "41, to take some uh very drastic measures against the Jewish people over there. </sentence><sentence id="243">So before the war start, I can say that we felt strong already the impact of fascist dictatorship government in our <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">I can elaborate more if you want what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="279">That's fine. </sentence><sentence id="280">That's fine. </sentence><sentence id="281">Uh, what, talk a little bit about uh, what kind of groups were you in at that time? </sentence><sentence id="282">Were you members of youth groups, were you involved in anything as the war approached, "39, "40? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="289">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="290">This is other interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="291">Like I told you when uh in our <span class="populated place">city</span> and in other probably <span class="populated place">city</span>, there was a lot of uh Zionist organizations. </sentence><sentence id="292">Young organizations, not young, and other political organizations, non-Jewish, with democratic tendency for more kinds of uh political uh beliefs. </sentence><sentence id="293">And they understand, uh many people understand that the time comes to do something. </sentence><sentence id="294">It's not only to wait to see what happen will happen. </sentence><sentence id="295">So there started a lot of discussion between uh young people, maybe old people too, to find a way to organize something to do. </sentence><sentence id="296">And uh, specially I can say, in uh "40, the government, the fascist government, uh issue a lot of laws against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="297">And one of them between many was a uh forbidding children, students, Jewish students was expelled from the <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">And here comes a very, very interesting situation position of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, because when all the students, Jewish students, were expelled from the <span class="building">school</span>, immediately was the Jewish local, Jewish leaders and the rabbis have big meetings what to do. </sentence><sentence id="299">So they decided again maybe my recollection time-wise not exactly month or year, but and "40,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection beginning or end or the fall of "40 or beginning of "41, the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> sent or decided to organize own <span class="building">school</span> for Jewish students. </sentence><sentence id="300">They promised to find the <span class="interior space">space</span>, to find the teachers, and was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="301">And I recall something about they decide to give the <span class="interior space">space</span> and other <span class="interior space">space</span> available was the <span class="building">Jewish community center</span> and start to organize the first <span class="building">high school</span> in the, in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">And there a lot of professional people who never in their lives they were teachers. </sentence><sentence id="303">They offer their service to be teachers. </sentence><sentence id="304">They got engineers, we have architects, and maybe other professional people, lawyer I remember, who become teachers. </sentence><sentence id="305">So we start to have our, our <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">So we start an hour of <span class="building">school</span> to discuss a lot about what has to be done and besides uh learning and teaching and the teachers, the students start to talk about to do something. </sentence><sentence id="307">So we start to organize some group, as a mixture of Zionist young people, non-Zionist people, and to have some friends who are non-Jewish in other <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">And we start to talk to them as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was very difficult to start to make connections. </sentence><sentence id="310">And was other political parties, democrat parties start to, to, to uh enter, to think about organize some. </sentence><sentence id="311">At that point we decide to organize some group over there to do something because we have some signal from abroad what start to happen to the Jewish people in uh <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">So we start to organize some group and to find a way to fight the German. </sentence><sentence id="313">Because now in the "41 the war started, the Jewish people more restricted in movements. </sentence><sentence id="314">They were confined to their <span class="building">home</span>, specially to the Jewish young people, specially, and uh sent in uh the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and mandatory <span class="building">factory</span> to dig <span class="dlf">trenches</span> for the war. </sentence><sentence id="315">Uh, they close the <span class="building">hospital</span>, <span class="building">public hospital</span>, to the Jewish uh patients, etc. </sentence><sentence id="316">etc. </sentence><sentence id="317">So was started to, to, talk and to think to do something, and we start to organize some groups. </sentence><sentence id="318">At one point between Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: What kind of groups were they? </sentence><sentence id="352">What did they do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="356">The most important thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what was going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict radio sets was taken from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="357">All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning "40, "41, the <span class="spatial object">radio sets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">So was not a way to, to listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">The <span class="spatial object">press</span> was under the control, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. </sentence><sentence id="360">And before the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call communiques about the war. </sentence><sentence id="361">So one of the first things we sought was to find what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="362">So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non- Jewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the people who had radios, have information based on their position, parents" position. </sentence><sentence id="363">And I remember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and two of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh equipment in order to listen what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="364">So this one was the first action, and we start from time to time to have some uh, some news. </sentence><sentence id="365">They succeeded to uh get some information through some if I recall <span class="building">BBC</span> from <span class="populated place">London</span> and from probably from <span class="country">Russia</span> they catch some, some news over there. </sentence><sentence id="366">But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put together this <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, during the day they dismantled the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> because if some police came in  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="building">collection house</span>, they don't find the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put together. </sentence><sentence id="367">Was a very difficult operation. </sentence><sentence id="368">Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put this way, and together parts was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="369">So the first action was to get information and the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. </sentence><sentence id="370">So we start to write the news in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. </sentence><sentence id="371">So was a shade of transmission of the news. </sentence><sentence id="372">And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to hide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. </sentence><sentence id="373">So we start to take for example, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some <span class="dlf">holes</span>, and put together and keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. </sentence><sentence id="374">Or other way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of <span class="dlf">doors</span> at one point Iremember. </sentence><sentence id="375">Some, some <span class="spatial object">toys</span> we used. </sentence><sentence id="376">So this is the first part of the action, was related to knowing what was going on and where we stand. </sentence><sentence id="377">Later on we decided to, to start to do more, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the German uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. </sentence><sentence id="378">So in our <span class="populated place">town</span> was a couple of <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">If I recall one was <span class="building">textile factory</span> manufacturing textile to prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. </sentence><sentence id="380">Was a big <span class="building">factory</span> prepare leather, paper and other kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="381">And all this <span class="building">industry</span> at one point works like forced labour, a lot of Jewish young people. </sentence><sentence id="382">And sure non-Jewish people were there. </sentence><sentence id="383">But many, many workmen were sent to fight against the Russians, the <span class="region">front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">So a lot of young Jewish and young, non- Jewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this <span class="building">factory</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="385">So in this place is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="386">Say, if I recall, to slow down the production for example. </sentence><sentence id="387">To start to uh, to break some <span class="spatial object">machines</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="388">And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. </sentence><sentence id="389">Was not maybe very big, we don't blow <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight against the <span class="country">Germany</span> and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="390">Some non-Jewish young people refused to go in the <span class="building">Army</span> to fight the war along the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="391">So uh all kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="392">At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and many nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go some place close. </sentence><sentence id="393">For example where the Germans keep their <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and to open the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, the <span class="spatial object">gas tank</span> and to put say some sand inside. </sentence><sentence id="394">And we discuss at one point to start to bring some small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put it some place where you know that the Germans uh <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span> will go through in some places. </sentence><sentence id="395">But was interesting because uh, many people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. </sentence><sentence id="396">Some, now, maybe appear very easy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the <span class="dlf">street</span> was a big deal to do. </sentence><sentence id="397">Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six o'clock no Jewish on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the Juda as they call it. </sentence><sentence id="399">But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I..(PHRASES MISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do because no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. </sentence><sentence id="400">And was a good feeling that later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will come to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. </sentence><sentence id="401">So anyways they will come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. </sentence><sentence id="402">But was a strong feeling among many people that have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="403">You know how many people died towards the <span class="region">front</span>, how many people died in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection people, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. </sentence><sentence id="404">They don't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="458">So you were part of this group. </sentence><sentence id="459">You were doing these things. </sentence><sentence id="460">Uh, what about your family during this time? </sentence><sentence id="461">How were you living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="468">What happens to the Jewish population? </sentence><sentence id="469">And I have to make a short or long paranthesis about this. </sentence><sentence id="470">The Jewish situation in <span class="country">Romania</span> during the war was different than in <span class="country">Poland</span>, in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in eastern uh <span class="region">western Europe</span> even because of political situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he gave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. </sentence><sentence id="471">They kept, the fascist government in <span class="country">Romania</span>, they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the <span class="region">territory</span>, of the <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. </sentence><sentence id="473">So they decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">To use them, to put them to work as a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">Was more useful. </sentence><sentence id="476">They can because they took a lot of young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the Germans against the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="477">So a lot of <span class="building">factories</span>, they don't have manpower, labor. </sentence><sentence id="478">So they want to use the Jewish people like a labor this <span class="building">work factory</span> as they put a lot of people over there. </sentence><sentence id="479">Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, to build uh defense uh <span class="dlf">lines</span>, at the front. </sentence><sentence id="480">So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were not sent to <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="481">Was used to work. </sentence><sentence id="482">Some were sent in different <span class="populated place">camps</span> in the <span class="region">territory</span> which the German took from <span class="country">Russia</span>, in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, and maybe come back, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="483">They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="484">But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="485">Because when they keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the <span class="building">factories</span>, they give something. </sentence><sentence id="486">They pay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. </sentence><sentence id="487">I don't want to express how much was, but say enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to buy other product which was if there was a <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">And other interesting thing I guess, now talking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the <span class="env feature">land</span>, and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some <span class="region">land</span> or <span class="dlf">farm</span>, two, three, four, five miles from the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, they come everyday in the <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="489"><span class="building">Special market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="490">Or they have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the chicken. </sentence><sentence id="491">And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day, before the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our <span class="dlf">door</span>, some meat sometimes, fruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. </sentence><sentence id="492">When the war started this farmer, or some farmers, continued to come to the <span class="populated place">city</span> to sell their products and many times they help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="493">They say start to give some products. </sentence><sentence id="494">They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue to, to work the <span class="env feature">land</span> and they come with the less product to the <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="495">But was some way to, to get something. </sentence><sentence id="496">And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people around. </sentence><sentence id="497">This only because big deal. </sentence><sentence id="498">They start to sell maybe their <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, they some goods whatever. </sentence><sentence id="499">Maybe they have some gold. </sentence><sentence id="500">Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start to sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="501">So was  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection some, some kind of connection to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="502">But the problem what important first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the <span class="building">public hospital</span> closed to the Jewish patients say so the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> start to organize some <span class="building">clinic</span> and to use some Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. </sentence><sentence id="503">They start to, to get a way to get some medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. </sentence><sentence id="504">We can't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. </sentence><sentence id="505">So many people start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical conditions over there. </sentence><sentence id="506">And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people didn't have food. </sentence><sentence id="507">So the most important thing was to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="508">Everybody everyday was the fight to keep, to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="509">So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="510">But people survived. </sentence><sentence id="511">Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some, some food to, to, to eat over there. </sentence><sentence id="512">And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a part of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. </sentence><sentence id="513">The fascist government start to take the <span class="building">houses</span> from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="514">And this is, a Jewish family has a <span class="building">house</span> is ten <span class="interior space">rooms</span> whatever. </sentence><sentence id="515">Most of the time they took all the <span class="building">house</span>, or nine <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, and they let the Jewish owner to stay in one <span class="interior space">room</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="516">Five, six people in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">And they give the rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="518">Sometimes, being a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, most of the <span class="building">houses</span>, they have some <span class="dlf">garden</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="519">So they start the Jewish people to, to uh to <span class="interior space">garden</span> a little. </sentence><sentence id="520">To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes maybe some tomatoes to put over there. </sentence><sentence id="521">Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="522">But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day somebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh formation to dig uh <span class="building">fortification</span> and many people didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="523">Was taken to say different part of the <span class="country">country</span> to work in the uh forced labor in the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="524">And many didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="525">We don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="526">So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and to be like your family to go through, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="527">And something else which probably could happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh history research will go further. </sentence><sentence id="528">But we know in "42 starting, Germans start to, to be defeated on the <span class="region">Russian front</span> and was a discussion about to open the <span class="region">second front</span> by <span class="country">United States</span> uh Army with uh Allies. </sentence><sentence id="529">So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, <span class="region">Russian front</span>, Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come back. </sentence><sentence id="530">They brought very bad feeling to their family. </sentence><sentence id="531">So non-Jewish family start to understand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. </sentence><sentence id="532">So they suffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their uh children to go to the war. </sentence><sentence id="533">They lost their children. </sentence><sentence id="534">Was tough for them even to, to get food over there. </sentence><sentence id="535">So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="536">Some neighbor would give sometimes say uh a bottle of milk to help, a loaf of bread, start to be some connection again because the people understood that on one hand the Jewish suffered, but they suffered too. </sentence><sentence id="537">It's not like to help the Jewish people, and maybe was, maybe, maybe was some opportunistic situation because they say this good, good relationship with the Jewish after the war. </sentence><sentence id="538">Who knows, you know. </sentence><sentence id="539">So uh the situation was tough, and many non- Jewish people took out many special fascist organization, took advantage, took all the Jewish business, all the <span class="building">Jewish factory</span>, all the big <span class="building">Jewish house</span>, or small <span class="building">Jewish houses</span>, so the only hope of the Jewish people was to, to get out of the war and we know that there be  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our <span class="region">territory</span> or to the Russian army, start the offensive about the Germans over there. </sentence><sentence id="540">So every day, every minute start to follow the news, where is the front is moving. </sentence><sentence id="541">And I recall like now when was <span class="populated place">downtown</span>, our <span class="populated place">town</span>, was a big map of the <span class="region">Russian front</span> showing how deep the German troops and others to penetrate in <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">How they move from say uh eastern, uh <span class="region">western part</span> of the <span class="country">Russia</span> through <span class="populated place">Kiev</span> to <span class="region">Caucasus</span> to <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> to <span class="populated place">Leningrad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">And everyday in "<span class="populated place">41</span>, the <span class="dlf">line</span> of the <span class="dlf">front</span> moving further and further. </sentence><sentence id="544">And we look at the <span class="spatial object">map</span> sometimes and we were very afraid. </sentence><sentence id="545">The further the German went, uh further our our hope was diminished, right. </sentence><sentence id="546">But after a while we knew the situation was changed. </sentence><sentence id="547">The Germans start to uh to be defeated. </sentence><sentence id="548">But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same place. </sentence><sentence id="549">They didn't move to show how far they come back. </sentence><sentence id="550">So we start to, to find every way to get information, were we stand. </sentence><sentence id="551">Each day the front came closer, closer to our uh <span class="region">land</span>, to this small <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">So uh, the more we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our <span class="dlf">border</span>, the more we think that maybe we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="553">But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot of discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="554">And was a lot of discussion about American troops would come through the <span class="country">Greece</span> at one point, to the, to open the <span class="region">second front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">And to come to <span class="country">Greece</span>, by the <span class="country">Romania</span> to cut the German and probably the Russian to go toward <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="556">But as you know, doesn't happen and the Russian came first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: What happened to you? </sentence><sentence id="650">This is 1942, the tide is turning, the Germans are being pushed back. </sentence><sentence id="651">What are you doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="655">A: Uh, well, at one point say in the "40's, "41, I was in the uh <span class="building">high school</span>, <span class="building">Jewish high school</span>, in "42. </sentence><sentence id="656">I start to be involved with a lot, with this organization who start to fight against the fascist regime. </sentence><sentence id="657">And in the "40, end of "42, "43 probably, I was sent to work in a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658"><span class="building">Textile factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="659">So I was a worker over there. </sentence><sentence id="660">And being over there I was involved together with other young people over there in kind of organization to sabotage the production and we try together to connect other people in other <span class="building">factories</span> and other <span class="building">schools</span> to start to act against the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="661">But at one point, say I was over there and basically the night I came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="662">Some people were sent to work outside of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="663">They have to stay to sleep in special <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">But some people work in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, had the permission to come <span class="building">home</span>, which was a better situation. </sentence><sentence id="665">So basically I come <span class="building">home</span> every night. </sentence><sentence id="666">I left the <span class="building">home</span> in the morning, I came - but in eight, in uh "43, in the "43, in the fall of "43, part of our organization was discovered by police, by security forces. </sentence><sentence id="667">And we start to be followed. </sentence><sentence id="668">So we stop for a while our activities. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="689">A: Basically, we start at one point like I told you before to spread the news. </sentence><sentence id="690">One of the big activities, to spread the news, to try to find out, to write what is going on at the front. </sentence><sentence id="691">And to put in all kinds, to work on a way to transmit this news, small papers. </sentence><sentence id="692">We started in the <span class="building">factory</span> to sabotage say the equipment, the heavy equipment. </sentence><sentence id="693">We started to dismantle some, some uh part of the <span class="spatial object">equipment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="694">Uh we start to cut some textiles over there. </sentence><sentence id="695">Uh we start to put to prepare outside the <span class="building">factory</span> some planks, some wood with nails and we start to from  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 time to time to go close to some <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span>, <span class="spatial object">German vehicle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">Not <span class="spatial object">German vehicle</span> who went to the front, to put the <span class="env feature">sand</span> or even to sabotage the tires, was over there. </sentence><sentence id="697">So this kind of uh activity was basically, and uh in "40, uh, was end of "43, the police discovered. </sentence><sentence id="698">They have an agent which introduced in our organization, and to the agent that we work with him, probably was wired to some people. </sentence><sentence id="699">He knew a lot so the spring of "44 they arrest uh five, six people in our organization and I was sent to the <span class="building">prison</span>, to the <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">And I was interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="701">I was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="702">I was there beaten to, to give information about other people. </sentence><sentence id="703">Finally, we, was in the spring of "44... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: OK. </sentence><sentence id="727">So basically I was arrested in the spring of "44. </sentence><sentence id="728">And I was in our <span class="building">local police</span> interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="729">And after a while in the same time after two or three weeks, they decided to evacuate the <span class="building">police headquarters</span> because the front start to move in "40, in the spring of "44 very close. </sentence><sentence id="730">And <span class="populated place">Moldavia</span> was the first part to come under the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="731">So they start to evacuate. </sentence><sentence id="732">The government tell uh <span class="building">offices</span>, authorities. </sentence><sentence id="733">So decided to send us another place to finish interrogation and to prepare the paper to be uh, to <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">So we was sent to a <span class="populated place">city</span> call <span class="populated place">Gala_i</span>, on the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">And over there starts some interrogations and start to prepare based on declarations made by uh the agent, the informant agent against us in the <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="736">Because we fight against the Nazi, you can't fight against a dictatorship, Romanian dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="737">But meantime, the war start to be closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="738">And they, try to remember, with some a lot of <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, <span class="spatial object">war planes</span> from <span class="country">Russia</span> start to fly over the <span class="populated place">city</span> and maybe some <span class="spatial object">American flights</span>. </sentence><sentence id="739">So every day, every night was some Allied movement, what you call it, air (air raid), air raids was over there. </sentence><sentence id="740">So one day they decide it's not safe. </sentence><sentence id="741">So they decided to send us, this group of young, was not only young people because we met other people over there, to move from this <span class="building">prison</span> to other <span class="building">prison</span> more safe and prepare to go to the <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="742">Was a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span

</sentence><sentence id="744">And one night they took irons, they put chains on our legs, and chain our uh arms, and sent to other <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="745">But in fact was not kind of regular <span class="building">prison</span>, was a <span class="building">monastery</span> as was transformed in a <span class="building">prison</span> like this. </sentence><sentence id="746">And we stay over there waiting for the trial. </sentence><sentence id="747">Was in uh uh "44. </sentence><sentence id="748">And in the spring of "44, toward May "44, start the Russian, recall the <span class="region">Russian front</span> was uh broken, the Russian victories against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="749">They come very close. </sentence><sentence id="750">They, they took uh <span class="populated place">Kiev</span>. </sentence><sentence id="751">They took <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence

they come to give some bread or some water, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="761">And was very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="762">Most of the people become sick over there. </sentence><sentence id="763">Was, was the spring of "44 if I recall and we cannot talk to anybody over there. </sentence><sentence id="764">Any connections. </sentence><sentence id="765">The first

from uh <span class="populated place">Gala_i</span> to <span class="populated place">Ploe_ti</span>, was the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="766">We stand, we cannot sit because of our <span class="spatial object">chains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="767">We sit together, or stand together, will start to talk. </sentence><sentence id="768">Anyway, we become very sick when we come to <span class="populated place">Ploe_ti</span> and <span class="populated place">Ploe_ti</span> in comparison with <span class="populated place">Gala_i</span> was a nice place because being a <span class="building">monastery</span> we have the right like everybody there, to walk out in the <span class="dlf">garden</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="769">There was some place under surveillance but one hour per day or one hour every day. </sentence><sentence id="770">So was a big change for us. </sentence><sentence id="771">And, and this uh place, we could talk a little more free with other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="772">Was not only political prisoners, how you call it, maybe they were criminals, maybe whatever they were, but they had some information about the war. </sentence><sentence id="773">And one day we find out that the <span class="building">Ploe_ti</span> was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="774">We saw them very heavily that uh, uh <span class="dlf">front</span> was again broken <span class="country">Moldavia</span> as the Germans started to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="775">Uh through <span class="env

day, I saw the, we saw that the people over there who uh ran the <span class="building">prison</span> start themselves to pack and to go. </sentence><sentence id="777">And they told us they would take us to our <span class="populated place">city</span> back. </sentence><sentence id="778">So one day we were put together in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and went to <span

</sentence><sentence id="970">And one day one my friends, and there was a general system which worked probably, he start to talk to me more and more and talked about what represent the German occupation, what represent the German war, against become the Russian, how's our situation and start to uh convince me, I guess, we have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="971">And as the beginning, I can't say my friend didn't tell me about any organization. </sentence><sentence id="972">He want to convince me that he has to do something. </sentence><sentence id="973">The first stage of you know, uh, his work with me. </sentence><sentence id="974">I have to convince me to do something. </sentence><sentence id="975">And he talk, and he start to give me some books to read. </sentence><sentence id="976">Was other things at one point, organization, some, some German book, if I recall, , American book, Upton Sinclar, it's a book __. </sentence><sentence id="977">OK. </sentence><sentence id="978">Uh we have some books by Russian, also Maxim Gorki they start to give us, uh some French also if I recall, Jaures, if I recall. </sentence><sentence id="979">So give some books, start to discuss, and after a couple of months, like very casual discussion right, uh he told, hey, if you agree that let's do something, let's do something, already there's organization you know, in <span class="building">school</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="980">We are doing something. </sentence><sentence id="981">We can get together. </sentence><sentence id="982">A lot of people think I got it, we have to do something or the German. </sentence><sentence id="983">So uh in this way he introduce me to one other member of organization, but I want to tell you something here, because now I talking with you start to recall something. </sentence><sentence id="984">Because of dictatorship, because of the terror, was not an organization like today we say hey, hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="985">Let's make organization. </sentence><sentence id="986">Let's have a meeting, call a meeting. </sentence><sentence id="987">No. </sentence><sentence id="988">Was some rules, and one of the rules of the organization and on work on the fight against <span class="country">Germany</span> is that one member has to know only other member they contact. </sentence><sentence id="989">So uh, if you were my contact, say to whom I talk, I know only you. </sentence><sentence id="990">And I got working directions, instructions from you only.

</sentence><sentence id="992">So he will know only me. </sentence><sentence id="993">So this organization, we don't know exactly to a point exactly how many people there were or what exactly is doing. </sentence><sentence id="994">But at one point, he introduced me to the other, say one or two uh colleagues, who happened to be  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 colleagues, and to get together and to see what we can do. </sentence><sentence id="995">More specially against the Germans and happened two of these uh colleagues in the <span class="building">school</span>, in the <span class="building">school</span>, later on worked on the same in the same <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="996">So when we went in this <span class="building">factory</span>, <span class="building">textile factory</span>, we start to discuss during break what, how to sabotage the work over there because they produce for the war. </sentence><sentence id="997">And how to maybe to talk to other friends in other <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="998">So first of all we start to slow down the work, and we start to talk to other people around. </sentence><sentence id="999">There are a lot of young people. </sentence><sentence id="1000">We was out to tell them about organization, about anything. </sentence><sentence id="1001">By talking about the tough situation of the people, the fact that the war have some big impact on our lives, to do something. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And to convince them to slow down, don't work, don't get . </sentence><sentence id="1003">So [remember two or three people in a couple of weeks start to become sick, start to, to, to go around a lot, start to walk, claims their equipment doesn't work. </sentence><sentence id="1004">So all kinds of uh action in order to, to, uh reduce the production. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And many of us start to at one point to cut some electrical wiring over there, which to make mortars. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Some parts we start to, to, to break some part of the <span class="spatial object">equipment</span>, so after a while there has to be a lot of uh maintenance, repairs, and there is not enough repair parts. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So one of our objectives inside was to, to slow the production ...to our possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1008">The second was like uh political action I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1009">You talk to the people to convince them that the uh fascist government is not good. </sentence><sentence id="1010">That we have to do something, that we have to fight for liberation from German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Was like uh political activity, to have more and more people to think like what we were thinking about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: That's interesting, a matter of fact, like I told you, during the war exactly, we don't know exactly the components of this group because say I know one or two people, maybe four people, and other know other people. </sentence><sentence id="1067">But basically what we find out that most of the groups was a conglomerate of people from different political uh what you call, uh beliefs. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Was many people, Zionist young people, think to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Was Communist we sort have to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Was social democrat. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Was other democratic members of all this party before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="1072">So was like a united front to fight against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And the Communist uh representative, a big deal probably, after the war we find out and organize this group. </sentence><sentence id="1074">They have an active part. </sentence><sentence id="1075">But the most important at this point was to fight the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1076">In different ways. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And uh many people thought that it is not necessary to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1078">These others because there was a big danger. </sentence><sentence id="1079">You expose your life. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And was the feeling specially in end of "42 when we know, people know that the war will be lost by <span class="country">Germany</span>, there's anyway, the Russian or American will come and liberate and <span class="country">Germany</span> will leave. </sentence><sentence id="1081">But the problem, as you know, when the German troop retreat, they kill not only Jewish people, other people. </sentence><sentence id="1082">So if I don't be killed from nothing, the last day it could happen something over there. </sentence><sentence id="1083">So many people think doesn't worth to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1084">When to fight, because the liberation come anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1085">The most important to keep, to keep us alive. </sentence><sentence id="1086">But other, many people thought is to do something, to give our contribution to the fight against the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1110"> 5 these other things. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Uh did you do any other kinds of sabotage-type of activities? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1112">A: Oh, I remember other kind was I was involved was to hide them. </sentence><sentence id="1113">They give me something to hide in my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Some books, some materials, sometimes even I didn't know what's inside. </sentence><sentence id="1115">But they told me they trust me to find a better way to hide than some materials. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And I remember we work not only to hide to say to dig in the uh <span class="env feature">soil</span> something, but to use some <span class="building">houses</span>" <span class="dlf">walls</span> or to, to take out some bricks and put back, and we have in our <span class="interior space">yard</span> a very old <span class="spatial object">car</span>, uh and I don't know, the engine, took some apart and they put inside. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And interesting thing was that we tried to uh have for this organization some people who have some connection with the government, some connection. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So that we can use for information. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And for example, I knew a former colleague, non-Jews, who was, his father was in the Army, and at one point we start to talk with him about, to meet him and to talk about the war, about the, what's going on, and he had some good feelings about our fight. </sentence><sentence id="1120">He went, was ready to do something. </sentence><sentence id="1121">So we use him, at one time to get him to hide in his <span class="building">house</span> some materials. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And he start to get some information from his father which was an Army officer of some type. </sentence><sentence id="1123">He knew more what's going on at the front, what's going on in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, and many times he came to me because when I start my <span class="building">high school</span> he was my uh, my colleague on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, sitting next to me, so we were some friends. </sentence><sentence id="1124">So we start to meet after the war a couple of times, and start to use his information, his situation to give information regarding the situation at the <span class="region">front</span>, regarding the situation in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And other thing interesting say at that time that I have to tell you was a girl in our <span class="populated place">town</span> from a very high-class family, put it this way, was Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1126">But during the war, like I told you, most of the <span class="building">houses</span> was taken by the authorities and given to non-Jewish people or they put some Army commander or officer, give some <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So uh the family of this girl which was famous in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, they have their own <span class="building">factory</span> was taken but had the position, had in their <span class="building">house</span> an officer of the Army, a high, high-level officer. </sentence><sentence id="1128">So we start to talk to this uh girl. </sentence><sentence id="1129">She was very nice girl. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And she had a bad situation. </sentence><sentence id="1131">She died many years ago in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1132">But she start to go from time to time inside the <span class="interior space">officer's room</span> through some <span class="dlf">doors</span> they have over there. </sentence><sentence id="1133">He has two, three <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And she start in one hand to use the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> to listen what's going on and she start to, to look through, through his papers and find what's going on in uh local political and army situation and basically, she didn't have very, very deep political conviction but she feels that she wants to help somehow the fight against the Germans to, to give her contribution here. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So was a way to, to find more and more information what you want and to help and she, we gave to her to keep books and to give some other written material which were uh some leaflets for example I remember was at one point against the Germans, against the war. </sentence><sentence id="1136">We distributed sometimes to some people this, and we hide it through her even in the <span class="interior space">officer's room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1137">So this was a very, very interesting uh story you know. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And uh, during the the end of the war, through her we find a lot of information. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1284">Q: In doing your underground work, what was the worst moment you ever had? </sentence><sentence id="1285">The worst experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: My worst moment, put it this way, was, (PAUSE) I cannot say the worst moment, was maybe was many moments. </sentence><sentence id="1289">One was when being in <span class="building">police</span> when was in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the same time was other two, three people which were taken, and I was in a <span class="interior space">cell</span> with a small <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1290">During the night I couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1291">But all of a sudden I, I heard some steps. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And I saw two policemen bringing somebody, some <span class="interior space">corridors</span>, and after a while I realized that the prisoner was one of my colleagues over there. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And they brought him as kind of <span class="interior space">basement</span> not far away from where I were, and start to beat him, talk to him over there. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And I heard his screams and I heard his cries and I watched you know what happened over there and I realized, for me was the worst moment because probably was almost dead over there. </sentence><sentence id="1295">But here, specially I knew like a comrade and like a nice person which I talked to many times and such a situation was horrifying. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And was horrifying to understand what happened to his mind and his feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Was something which one is the worst moment. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And the second worst moment I guess was for me when we were transferred from one <span class="building">prison</span>, from <span class="populated place">Gala_i</span>, to <span class="populated place">Ploe_ti</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I told you before. </sentence><sentence id="1300">We was put in a kind of <span class="building">prison</span>, in a <span class="building">monastery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1301">By this <span class="building">monastery</span> was probably, I don't recall, six, seven kilometers, probably five miles, from <span class="populated place">Ploe_ti</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1302">We were in chains, and the hands cuffed, so from <span class="building">Ploe_ti station</span> to the <span class="building">monastery</span> was not any communication. </sentence><sentence id="1303">We have to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So during the walk, during the night, was night, to start to walk and the <span class="building">monastery</span> was on a kind of <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We have to uh, <span class="dlf">road</span> winding and climbing. </sentence><sentence id="1306">After ten minutes, fifteen minutes, almost nobody could no more walk because the chain on the legs makes them uh, wounds, wounds you because. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And they at one point start to bleed. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And they couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And almost I fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And other people fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1311">At that moment, we stop for maybe a couple of seconds, and once the policemen start to come to us and say, go, don't, we have to, to get to the <span class="building">monastery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1312">You have to give you a way to catch back our <span class="spatial object">train</span>, so don't care about you. </sentence><sentence id="1313">So it was like the end of the world for us. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Finally, one of uh our colleague have an idea to take some handkerchiefs or our shirt, I don't remember, to make a knot to our uh chains and to tie it to our belts so the chain doesn't fall down on our ankles here. </sentence><sentence id="1315">So we try to do this for a while, but again start to fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1316">So the worst moment probably, we walked two hours say, close to two hours, but I thought was eternity. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And then a funny moment happened when we went to this uh <span class="building">monastery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They have a big <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Was not inside the <span class="building">monastery</span>, was outside. </sentence><sentence id="1320">The kind of place where they kept probably some uh <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> to take uh care about the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And they push inside. </sentence><sentence id="1322"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for

I was surprised because the third was not an agent, was other colleague, was , was my connection. </sentence><sentence id="1344">He made the declaration before that he knew me. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1471">A: Uh, I mentioned manuscript about this Traian or Trane. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I don't know how to pronounce  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 because was a very interesting person, very strange. </sentence><sentence id="1473">Was a mixture of good and bad. </sentence><sentence id="1474">But was uh like an interesting story, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1475">So being this guy, young man in 40's, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1476">He was young guy in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> I know. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I remember like now that his father was an invalid from the first war and saved some license invalids from the war, first war, to sell cigarettes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1478"><span class="building">Tobacco shops</span> to have, to give a way to make a living for the, who are veterans. </sentence><sentence id="1479">So I know about him. </sentence><sentence id="1480">I know him on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, maybe on the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1481">So one day in "40 when the Iron Guard become very powerful, "40, I guess "40, maybe beginning of "41, I saw this guy Triane, his Iron Guard uniform on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Green uniform, military uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And he starts to yell and to beat some people who think they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And for a while, at the end of the "40, maybe beginning of "41, the Iron Guard was part of the government of the dictatorship of General Antonescu, was most extremist right say wing, fascist wing. </sentence><sentence id="1485">And some places they put their people in charge of the security forces. </sentence><sentence id="1486">The police we call them. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So this young man become the chief of security, of police in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1488">Iron Guard security. </sentence><sentence id="1489">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1490">After a while, when uh <span class="building">Iron Guard</span> was defeated by General Antonescu. </sentence><sentence id="1491">It's a long story. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Many run out of the <span class="country">country</span> and many disappear, there's a fight on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1493">It's a long story, don't want it in details, but I didn't hear anything about same person called Traian. </sentence><sentence id="1494">When I was arrested, and moved from our <span class="populated place">town</span> to <span class="populated place">Gala_i</span> to <span class="building">prison</span>, was by, moved by a uh <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, I saw the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with other people was this guy Traian. </sentence><sentence id="1495">After say three years maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And I was surprised what he's doing with the people who fought against the German, because a part of Iron Guard. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I didn't know, I couldn't ask him. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Was dark, we went to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1499">After Gala_i, we was transferred to this <span class="building">monastery</span> where was more free, so we start to talk between them. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Talk to him, to talk to other people. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And I asked one other uh colleague who was with me in organization, what's doing this guy here because he was an Iron Guard, and we fought against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And let's tell you his story shortly. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And looks first of all, he was condemned to death by uh fascist organization being an Iron Guard leader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1504">So he have a bad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the <span class="populated place">town</span> and later on come back and he was hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. </sentence><sentence id="1505">He's former roommate or colleague or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1506">So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a death penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="1507">After a while, one of the sons of the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist movement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over there to him. </sentence><sentence id="1508">So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and let him try to go to send him to some <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="country">Russia</span> with Jewish people, non-Jewish people, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh packages, some products or some <span class="building">grocery</span> or some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1509">So he agreed to go again like a what you call <span class="interior space">underground</span> to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So he went a couple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh transmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that was in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1511">One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from hiding, probably to go in uh special <span class="building">house</span> to have some lady relationship, with some prostitutes or some <span class="building">bordello</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And he went over there and some policemen around recognize him, so they put him under surveillance and they follow him, and they follow where he went. </sentence><sentence id="1513">So the police, the fascist police start to survey the <span class="building">house</span> and finally  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 they decided to arrest some people of the <span class="building">house</span>, including him. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So he went together with this group and our group when all was the same time to the police. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And he, he was again put under trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like helping the anti-fascist movement. </sentence><sentence id="1516">But he was all the time afraid that he was put there because he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and he told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and he want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And probably my feeling he was a little opportunistic. </sentence><sentence id="1518">He knew, he was smart guy. </sentence><sentence id="1519">He knew that the situation would change anyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. </sentence><sentence id="1520">So after uh the German left and uh become independent uh <span class="country">country</span> again if I can say, he was in charge for a while like security chief, security force in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Bac_u</span> but now like presence of communists. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And happened he married a Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1522">But finally after a while, put it this way, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with him, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be democratic, to be communist and to help the communists. </sentence><sentence id="1523">So he was, we found this true, expelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some place in our small <span class="populated place">town</span> to work like in accounting. </sentence><sentence id="1524">But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how some people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the color of their shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Some people have some convictions, something. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of their life. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Didn't want to change. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Other, according to the circumstances, feel more safe for them to, to change their convictions. </sentence><sentence id="1530">To say I'm sorry for yesterday, but now I'm changed. </sentence><sentence id="1531">I'm with you. </sentence><sentence id="1532">So this happened many times and even now days you see many places over the world the same, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="1533">But was interesting you know how they were alright, the people were alright.
