<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3999">A: Why is it relevant? </sentence><sentence id="4000">I think that it's relevant because people are -- most people in this <span class="country">country</span> and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what happens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as they were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message is still fresh. </sentence><sentence id="4001">You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is the only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides. </sentence></p></dialogue>
