years after us. </sentence><sentence id="26">Actually I was born on the <span class="dlf">street</span> called <span class="dlf">4</span> and my sister was born in the <span class="interior

space">apartment</span> and <span class="building">office</span> that I lived til the second war world IL I have very fond memories of my childhood, and my parents really tried their best to...to make us, me and my sister very happy. </sentence><sentence id="27">As soon as I was born I had a nanny and the nanny became a very big part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="28">And even my father who was the real father was afraid of my nanny because she became the boss. </sentence><sentence id="29">She adored my mother, but she actually was the only ones that stood up against my father and I...it was sometimes when I used to go up and <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, it reminded me about her attitude, and her friends because every day she used to take me to the <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">When I used to go to the <span class="dlf">park</span>, I had to be dressed up...uh...like a little princess. </sentence><sentence id="31">I... had to wear a little hat, and I had to wear gloves and new shoes. </sentence><sentence id="32">And when she came there, she met all the other nannies and they were talking and gossiping about their ladies and their bosses what they do there and what they...and what they were and how they spent their evening. </sentence><sentence id="33">And one...one wanted to tell the life of their ladies more interesting than the other. </sentence><sentence id="34">If my nanny decided that the dress I was wearing this day was not good enough, she didn't even consult my father or my  mother, she just went to the <span class="building">store</span> where we had credit. </sentence><sentence id="35">She bought me material. </sentence><sentence id="36">She went to the <span class="building">dressmaker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">She ordered a dress and this was it. </sentence><sentence id="38">And so my father got the bill and he asked what happened? </sentence><sentence id="39">How come you're spending so much money on little girls that will grow up? </sentence><sentence id="40">She used to say, "I cannot...I cannot allow my little girl look worse than any other one. </sentence><sentence id="41">Do you want us to be poor? </sentence><sentence id="42">Do you want people to think that we are poor? </sentence><sentence id="43">We have...we have to have appearances." </sentence><sentence id="44">And my father doesn't even say anything. </sentence><sentence id="45">When I had...when I was 6 years old, and my parents send me to a <span class="building">private school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">This was a <span class="building">school</span> that Jewish children used to go, but we were taught only Polish. </sentence><sentence id="47">And the name of the <span class="building">school</span> was the <span class="building">Private Coeducational</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">It was called <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, and it was a <span class="building">private co-educational school</span> called . </sentence><sentence id="49">And it was located on the <span class="dlf">street</span> on Il. </sentence><sentence id="50">It was a very exclusive <span class="building">school</span> and I have very fond memories about it, because this teacher was a really dedicated and knowledgeable people. </sentence><sentence id="51">The atmosphere was very congenial and we had all the <span class="building">facility</span> that very often I wish my children would have when they were growing up. </sentence><sentence id="52">Because we had slides, we had <span class="building">clinical laboratories</span>, <span class="building">physical laboratories</span> and we had the ____, and we used.to really...had very nice nature trips. </sentence><sentence id="53">And the only thing what I cannot forget how we used to admire and respect our teacher who were really trying their best to make our life interesting and also the lessons that they teach were very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="54">When we studied about the French Revolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about____------ head rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the book. </sentence><sentence id="55">And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big interest in reading, and very soon...as soon as I studied to...I knew how to read, my father on the suggestion of my mother took me to the <span class="building">library</span> and then a new world opened before me because I started to read. </sentence><sentence id="56">I...there were days that I had...I finished a book a day. </sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, in the beginning was just children's books, but a new world opened in front of me and my mother was very happy because she believed very strongly about culture. </sentence><sentence id="58">She used to drag me and my sister to all...to <span class="building">children theatres</span> to ballet. </sentence><sentence id="59">We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata. </sentence><sentence id="60">And she really used to pump culture into us because she used to say...I remember it well, "that the person who doesn't appreciate the music or poetry or finest things of life is really half...half blind and half...hard of feelings, because this everything is free, and you have to really appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="61">Coming back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend and I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never saw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person. </sentence><sentence id="62">She had a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our <span class="building">house</span> and with those little...uh...horse...horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span>, and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were just kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist. </sentence><sentence id="63">And they used to bring all kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a toothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the <span class="building">office</span> and my mother would never ask them how much they can pay. </sentence><sentence id="64">They pay how much they could, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also. </sentence><sentence id="65">So she always imbedded in our mind the concept of charity. </sentence><sentence id="66">This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started to feel the wind of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="67">My father...my father was working as a registered pharmacist in a very big <span class="building">pharmacy</span> that was a <span class="building">government pharmacy</span> from the <span class="building">social services</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">Every worker was involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="69">Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there. </sentence><sentence id="70">They were the students that were on top of the <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">In 1935, my father was told and also his two  colleagues that they have...in order to work there, they have to obtain a Masters Degree in <span class="building">pharmacy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">Of course, they had no other choice. </sentence><sentence id="73">They studied...they were studying. </sentence><sentence id="74">I was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="75">My father used to close himself in...in his <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and work and <span class="interior space">study</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">He used to go on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the medicine from the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">They have to prepare it. </sentence><sentence id="78">And finally when the tests came...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test. </sentence><sentence id="79">The man...the professor that gave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass the test. </sentence><sentence id="80">But he passed the test with flying colors. </sentence><sentence id="81">The written test and the oral. </sentence><sentence id="82">And as he was getting up from the <span class="spatial object">chair</span>...he was practically by the <span class="dlf">door</span>, after he...telling him about so many complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him, "David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the <span class="spatial object">C2 03</span>, and my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer him. </sentence><sentence id="83">And he just didn't pass him. </sentence><sentence id="84">So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it. </sentence><sentence id="85">But after a very short time, a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a <span class="building">government institution</span>, and my father lost his job. </sentence><sentence id="86">I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and my grandmother had 16 children but only four survived because...uh...the children were...died in the infancy, and after 12 children died, she..there was...uh...folklore in our family telling us that she went to a very famous rabbi and the rabbi told her that he...that if you wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white. </sentence><sentence id="88">Even...only in white, even if they grew...grow up and be able to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">And when the child will ask you, "Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in white...I'm dressed in white," then you can take off and dress the child in any colors. </sentence><sentence id="90">And this what happened. </sentence><sentence id="91">And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white. </sentence><sentence id="92">And my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="93">The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to <span class="country">Argentina</span> with one of the sisters went to the <span class="country">United States</span>, and one of the sisters lived with her parents in <span class="country">Poland</span> and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family. </sentence><sentence id="94">And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very close knit family. </sentence><sentence id="95">And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were six children, two brothers and four sisters. </sentence><sentence id="96">One sister, as a young girl, got married and immigrated to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">One sister got married to a very rich man that was a manufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse. </sentence><sentence id="98">Her name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was actually my second mother and my...my mother, as I mentioned you, mentioned to you, was also a professional. </sentence><sentence id="99">And they were a very knit families. </sentence><sentence id="100">The two brothers, one the older brother was a publisher of a Jewish paper in <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span>, and the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice dentistry but opened a...a <span class="building">business</span>...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and dental mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="101">When it happened, the whole family got together. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a <span class="building">pharmacy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">He couldn't buy a <span class="building">pharmacy</span> in <span class="populated place">Vilno</span>, but they found for him a <span class="building">pharmacy</span> in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Soley</span>, but then a very tragic thing occurred. </sentence><sentence id="104">They didn't want to sell a <span class="building">pharmacy</span> to a Jewish pharmacist. </sentence><sentence id="105">So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion  had to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the <span class="building">pharmacy</span> was bought. </sentence><sentence id="106">This happened in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="107">And my...my...actually my family split because my mother and my sister had to go to <span class="populated place">Soley</span> and find an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> near the <span class="building">pharmacy</span> for my father and we stayed in <span class="country">Poland</span> because my...we were going to <span class="building">school</span>, and my mother was practicing in <span class="populated place">Vilno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">And this was the time that the very tragic event occurred. </sentence><sentence id="109">My mother got sick. </sentence><sentence id="110">My mother developed cancer, and when my father took her to the doctor and she was operated on in one of the best <span class="building">hospitals</span> in <span class="populated place">Vilno</span>, she was...she was opened and closed and the professor told my father that she had 6 months to live. </sentence><sentence id="111">The cancer spread all over her body and you have two little girls. </sentence><sentence id="112">You have to live. </sentence><sentence id="113">But no...don't count on your wife. </sentence><sentence id="114">It was a terrible tragedy for us. </sentence><sentence id="115">We were, as children, not told about it. </sentence><sentence id="116">And the only thing that...that we knew that she was going for treatment. </sentence><sentence id="117">Then it was cobalt treatments and she used to feel really very bad but a little miracle happened because after 6 months she went into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated to her that they...we had to take off the bell from the <span class="dlf">door</span> because everybody would come and just wanted to find out how she is doing. </sentence><sentence id="118">Now I have to tell a little story about our dog. </sentence><sentence id="119">We had a dog called Rex, which is in...with the ____ in Latin. </sentence><sentence id="120">And we actually grew up with the dog because when I was born, my parents bought this dog and she was our best friend. </sentence><sentence id="121">The dog always when we used to eat at <span class="building">home</span>, the dog was stay in the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> under the <span class="spatial object">table</span> we used to throw him the best morsels. </sentence><sentence id="122">The only thing if...when the dog was not present when the guests came and my parents were entertaining their colleagues, it was a thing in our family that the...that the children had to be seen but not heard, and they had to disappear together with the dog. </sentence><sentence id="123">My...when my mother got sick and she was lying in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, the dog was sitting near here and there was no power that you should take away the dog from her <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">The only thing that he used to go...he used to go to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> when he ...where he had his dish to eat. </sentence><sentence id="125">And he would eat, drink a little water and lie on his little <span class="spatial object">pillow</span> near my mother. </sentence><sentence id="126">And the dog...when my mother didn't survive, this what...we felt actually the tragedy in my young life because on May the 22st, the 24th 1939, my mother passed away. </sentence><sentence id="127">And it was something unbelievable because I was sleeping and all of a sudden I was wakened up by the howling of the dog. </sentence><sentence id="128">When my mother passed away, the...the dog started to howl so strong that they had to take him out from the <span class="building">house</span> with the...with the force. </sentence><sentence id="129">And it was such a big tragedy for me because I adored my mother. </sentence><sentence id="130">I was proud of her. </sentence><sentence id="131">The best day of the week was for me Friday because she wasn't working, and she used to take us to all the functions and used to...she used to take us to the <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I was so proud of her because she really was so beautiful that strange men used to tip their hats for her...uh..say to her, call her like princess or madonna or queen. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I was so proud of it all. </sentence><sentence id="134">My...this is my mother! </sentence><sentence id="135">So it was a terrible tragedy for me. </sentence><sentence id="136">We had a tremendous funeral. </sentence><sentence id="137">All the children from my <span class="building">class</span> and from my mother's class...uh...from my sister's <span class="building">class</span> came. </sentence><sentence id="138">And so many colleagues and so many patients that we didn't even realize that she had...that she was known by so many people. </sentence><sentence id="139">And the dog wanted to go in this...in this <span class="spatial object">cortege</span>, but he was...the funeral cortege, but he was taken. </sentence><sentence id="140">When I came <span class="building">home</span> from the funeral, I was very broken up and I really was so desperate

because all the lilacs are growing and the <span class="env feature">air</span> is just perfumated with jasmine and lilacs. </sentence><sentence id="142">It is the most beautiful time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="143">So ona Saturday when ____ my little friends took me out and we were walking through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>  and the sun was shining and the birds were singing and I said to my God, "The life is going on and my mother is not any more with us." </sentence><sentence id="144">I couldn't find peace. </sentence><sentence id="145">My teachers came to visit me and I was a very good student. </sentence><sentence id="146">Have to remember I was a teacher's pet and studying was very easy for me. </sentence><sentence id="147">And all of a sudden...uh...my

</sentence><sentence id="1400">We had to stand up, and they said that young women will be taken to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1401">My sister then

broke out there. </sentence><sentence id="1411">My aunt and my cousin died right there in the epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="1412">My cousin-in-law survived this...this epidemic, and I met her
