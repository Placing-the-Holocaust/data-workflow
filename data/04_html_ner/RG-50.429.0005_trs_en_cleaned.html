<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: And you were good at it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: And I was good at it, without working very hard at it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Did sports start playing a very significant role in your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well once I got to be in the age where I got to be noticing boys it became a very important thing in my life because that was the social life then, you know you went to the <span class="building">gym</span> and uh the boy you had your eye on walked you <span class="building">home</span> and that was a big deal and that was very good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Was sports important in <span class="country">Germany</span> growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes, I think there was hardly the smallest little <span class="populated place">village</span> that didn't have some kind of sports going. </sentence><sentence id="32">If it was just a <span class="building">soccer club</span>, <span class="building">club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">You know they play soccer and, and team sports more but there were very few places where there was nothing going on and that was a very important thing and once I got a little older, maybe 14 or so, we used to go to other little <span class="populated place">towns</span> and compete there and that was really like a lot of fun and you met a lot of new people and, and it was, it was great. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Were there a lot of <span class="building">sporting clubs</span> and... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="39">Has nothing to do with the <span class="building">school</span> as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="40">I think that's why I hated <span class="building">school</span> so much because whenever I came into <span class="building">school</span> on Monday the teachers would make fun of me and say oh you must have had a tough weekend again. </sentence><sentence id="41">Maybe you were playing <span class="dlf">field</span> hand ball or something and why don't you pay more attention to your, your lessons and I think that turned me off more than anything else and I turned more to sports then instead of less, the way I thought I would. </sentence></p></dialogue>
