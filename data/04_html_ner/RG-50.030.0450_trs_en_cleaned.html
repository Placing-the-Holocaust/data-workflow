<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">ERNEST FONTHEIM March 13, 1997 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: ...was Eva Irene. </sentence><sentence id="3">She was born in 1927. </sentence><sentence id="4">My family background was that I am, my parents were completely assimilated in German culture and in the German way of life and there were very few of Jewish observances. </sentence><sentence id="5">My mother went with us to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> on the high holidays, that is the only thing I remember. </sentence><sentence id="6">I remember much more distinctly, however, that we celebrated Christmas, we had a <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span> every year, Santa Claus came and distributed gifts and I grew up really knowing very little about being Jewish except I knew that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="7">My, also my father had a very extensive <span class="building">library</span>, he was actually generally very widely read and widely educated. </sentence><sentence id="8">I do not remember any Jewish books, the books that we had were just general literature, German writers, Shakespeare, of course. </sentence><sentence id="9">The particular pride of my father was a 54 volume edition of the collected works of Goethe, the German playwright and philosopher of the early 19th Century. </sentence><sentence id="10">We were, as far as I can tell, relatively well off. </sentence><sentence id="11">We went on summer vacations every year and I particularly was sent during the summer vacations, from maybe the age of 10 on or so, toa <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">These <span class="populated place">camps</span> were usually all <span class="populated place">Jewish camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">They were headed usually by a Jewish sports teacher and were located, they were different from <span class="populated place">American camps</span> in that they didn't have a specific camp location, but instead the head of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the sports teacher, would contract with some vacation owner of a <span class="building">building</span>, of a <span class="building">vacation house</span>, in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> or near the <span class="env feature">sea</span> to rent that <span class="building">house</span> for a period of about four weeks, I guess, or six weeks, and then he would take the kids to that place and, of course, with a number of assistants and so on. </sentence><sentence id="14">I personally would have liked much better to be going on vacations with my parents, but my father  worked very hard and I was always told that my father needed complete rest and relaxation and that it was just too much of a commotion if we kids would also come along. </sentence><sentence id="15">And usually what happened was, after a few days of being <span class="building">home</span> sick then I got sort of sucked into the activities of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, made some friends and, in some of the cases, actually some <span class="building">school</span> friends of mine from the <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> were at the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so I had already ready-made friends there. </sentence><sentence id="16">From then on, I usually enjoyed these vacations. </sentence><sentence id="17">My contacts with Judaism really became stronger basically out of two events. </sentence><sentence id="18">The first one was Hitler's assumption of power in, generally, 1933, where in the <span class="building">school</span> where I was I was made to feel that I was different. </sentence><sentence id="19">The first year there was very little Nazi activity in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="building">school</span> I went to, incidentally, was the <span class="building">Mommsen Gymnasium</span> named after the German historian of the Roman Empire, Theodor Mommsen, who actually personally was a very liberal minded historian. </sentence><sentence id="21">And <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, in German means really <span class="building">classical high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">That <span class="building">school</span> received, got a new principal in the year 1934, he was a retired Army colonel who had fought in the First World War and also was a through and through convinced Nazi ideologue. </sentence><sentence id="23">And right after his assumption of the principal-ship, he announced in a <span class="building">school</span> assembly that it is his goal to make the <span class="building">school</span> a sort of example for Nazi ideological indoctrination. </sentence><sentence id="24">At that point, many Jewish kids were taken out of that <span class="building">school</span> by their parents and sent to other <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">I stayed in and after one year of that principal, only two kids, Jewish kids, were left, another boy and I. The principal introduced all kinds of new activities like, for example, before the beginning of the school day, the entire <span class="building">school</span> had to assemble for sort of like a military roll call. </sentence><sentence id="26">Behind the <span class="building">school building</span> there was a big <span class="dlf">sports field</span> and we assembled there and had to stand at military attention and while the principal read  a particular paragraph that he had selected for that day out of Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, as sort of motto for the day. </sentence><sentence id="27">And during lunch hour, after we had eaten our food, we usually marched, the entire <span class="building">school</span> in military formation, through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, singing Nazi songs. </sentence><sentence id="28">After one year of his principal-ship, as I said there were two kids left, and he asked us to come into his <span class="building">office</span> and that, in <span class="country">Germany</span>, where the principal in general is a much more fearsome authority than you see now. </sentence><sentence id="29">In addition to that, of course, we knew where he stood, for us it was a somewhat intimidating experience. </sentence><sentence id="30">When we were in his <span class="building">office</span> he told us that he could not really see having Jewish children in his <span class="building">school</span>, which he wanted to make as a purely Germanic or <span class="building">Aryan school</span> serving as an example for all other <span class="building">schools</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">But, he also had no legal way to expel us from the <span class="building">school</span>, so he thought about it and came to the following conclusion, that there were basically two options. </sentence><sentence id="32">Either our parents withdrew us voluntarily or he would simply resign the principalship because he would not be able, under those conditions, to carry out his goals, and with that message we were sent <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">Our fathers got together on the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> and discussed that this was obviously a veiled threat and we were never sent back to that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: I was surprised when you mentioned that you were sent to a <span class="populated place">Jewish camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Yeah, well, after 1933, there was increasing pressure really for, to keep Jews and non-Jews apart. </sentence><sentence id="69">I think maybe in "33 or "34, I may still have been in a mixed <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but after that, such <span class="populated place">camps</span> simply didn't exist anymore. </sentence><sentence id="70">Actually, there was an additional reason, that all youth activities for Germans were progressively taken over by the <span class="building">Hitler Youth Organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">They went on summer excursions, on hikes and so on, and German children initially were just sort of socially pressured to participate, but I think in the  mid-"30's, I don't remember the year, maybe "36 or so, it was actually made compulsory, that every German kid, as a boy, had to be in the <span class="building">Hitler Youth</span> and it had a parallel girls organization which was called, it was a German word, <span class="building">Bund Deutscher Madel</span> , it means Association of German Girls, and girls were compulsorily in that organization. </sentence><sentence id="72">And if there were any organizations outside of the Hitler Youth, they definitely would not be permitted to have any Jewish children in them, so that was not a religious thing, these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">Actually, I remember one <span class="populated place">camp</span> where I was where the head was actually a woman sports teacher and she was a very strong Zionist and she would have Friday evening Shabbat ceremonies and carry on other Jewish activities. </sentence><sentence id="74">And in all the other <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they were Jewish only to the extent that both the head and teachers, as well as all the kids, were Jews, but otherwise, there were no Jewish related activities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Now, prior to Hitler, do you remember any instances of antisemitism, did you get along well with your neighbors and your <span class="building">schoolmates</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="85">No, I mean, I don't remember such instances. </sentence><sentence id="86">I always got along, the strange thing is that practically all, with one exception, all of my friends were always Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="87">That happened somehow naturally, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="88">There was truly no, I wasn't told by my parents to have Jewish friends exclusively, but that's the way it turned out. </sentence><sentence id="89">But even after Hitler came to power, I had, I mean I had no, I do not remember any incidents where I was either attacked or had any violence on the part of my <span class="building">German school</span> children. </sentence><sentence id="90">In fact, initially, my reaction to the Nazi seizure of power was that I felt sorry for myself for not being an Aryan, I mean, a German kid, and that I couldn't participate in all the what I considered fun things that they were doing, games and so on, and it was really only after I was expelled from the <span class="building">German school</span>, actually, let me back up. </sentence><sentence id="91">I said  earlier that my relationship to Judaism changed drastically for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="92">I mean, one was Hitler's accession to power and, which basically forced me to confront my Jewishness, the other was my bar mitzvah, which came up in 1935 and which required me to take, several times a week, preparatory lessons, both for my, for the parshah which I was going to read from the Torah on the Shabbat during services on my bar mitzvah, as well as additional sort of Jewish history and some Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="93">And that, and then on top of it also, in 1935 was my expulsion from the <span class="building">Mommsen Gymnasium</span> by this antisemitic principal, and my parents then transferred me to a very <span class="building">orthodox Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">That has always been a puzzle in my mind, my parents never explained it. </sentence><sentence id="95">There were other <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> which were much less orthodox, but they transferred me to the most orthodox of <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">In fact, it was a <span class="building">school</span> associated with a sort of separatist congregation, the, all of the, the rest of the Jewish community was in one large sort of super congregation, I think that is in most <span class="populated place">European cities</span> like that, where Jewish communal life, is handled by one big congregation and that congregation also is responsible for building <span class="building">synagogues</span> according to different needs. </sentence><sentence id="97">I mean, there were one or two <span class="building">reform synagogues</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and many what was called <span class="building">liberal synagogues</span>, that was the sort of predominant denomination. </sentence><sentence id="98">In spite of the name, the <span class="building">liberal synagogues</span> were about very close to what is called conservative here in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">The service was almost entirely in Hebrew with only one or two prayers in German, however, in most liberal <span class="building">synagogues</span>, <span class="spatial object">organs</span> were also present and otherwise, the service, also the selection of prayers, was basically the same as that in the conservative <span class="building">synagogues</span> and much more extensive than in the <span class="building">reform synagogues</span> in this <span class="country">country</span>, but all of the <span class="building">synagogues</span> were essentially the responsibility of this central congregation and also there were a number of  <span class="building">orthodox synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">But the <span class="building">school</span> into which I was transferred to was from a separatist, very orthodox congregation affiliated with the <span class="building">Agudas Yisrael</span> which is a worldwide sort of umbrella organization of orthodox congregations. </sentence><sentence id="101">I think the reason was that <span class="building">school</span> had an excellent reputation, while it obviously taught a lot of Judaism, Hebrew and Jewish history and so on, but they, of course, they still were governed by the German education law and had to provide, therefore, all of the curriculum that regular <span class="building">German schools</span> had to offer in mathematics and science and literature and so on. </sentence><sentence id="102">But, obviously, that was a tremendous change for me, a change of cultures. </sentence><sentence id="103">Coming from the militaristic <span class="building">Nazi school</span>, now to a very <span class="building">orthodox Jewish school</span> which, at the beginning when I came there, seemed to be without any semblance of discipline. </sentence><sentence id="104">I, myself, have always been somewhat of a rebel in the sense that I resented authority, and even in the <span class="building">Mommsen Gymnasium</span>, which was governed by this Prussian ex-officer, there were a number of boys to whom I also belonged to, sort of tried to get away with things. </sentence><sentence id="105">Now when I came to that <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, I really reveled in the fact that there seemed to be no discipline at all and people even talked back to their teachers and I must say, I enjoyed that very much and in spite of that, the funny thing is I learned. </sentence><sentence id="106">The thing is that the excuse for extreme discipline is always that it is needed in order for the kids to learn, I mean I realize there has to be a certain amount of discipline, but in the <span class="building">German schools</span>, at least at the Nazi time, that was an ideology by itself, in its own right, discipline, of course, as a preparation for later military. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Now, didn't you experience antisemitism from your schoolmates at the <span class="building">Mommsen school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: I don't, no I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="132">In fact, one, I remember that one of my non-Jewish, we weren't really friends, but we sort of spent some time together frequently in <span class="building">school</span> during intermissions and so on, recess is the word, recess, he was, he had joined the Hitler Youth and he had given me a small Hitler Youth pennant with a swastika which I proudly displayed. </sentence><sentence id="133">And, unfortunately, it turned out that on that day we had, at <span class="building">home</span> a party, I forgot what the cause was, there were relatives there and, of course, all the people who came were Jews, and in the middle of it, I burst with my swastika flag and holding it proudly and marched in there. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I remember that my mother took me very forcefully by my arm, took me out to my <span class="interior space">room</span> and gave me a horrific beating and told me that I should never dare to bring that flag <span class="building">home</span> and she tore it up and I felt terribly sorry for myself and felt as a victim of, but as I said, that was in the beginning when I felt that being Jewish was basically a punishment and it took a number of jolts for me to realize really what was behind that and also what my Judaism really meant to me. </sentence><sentence id="135">The antisemitism that I encountered was mainly from the teachers. </sentence><sentence id="136">That principal, maybe I forgot to mention that he also taught, that was I think common in <span class="building">German schools</span>, and he was our math teacher and he made frequent antisemitic remarks and derogatory remarks about Jews in his mathematics class. </sentence><sentence id="137">And then we had a German teacher who was, if anything, even worse and, on the other hand, some of the older teachers were very democratic. </sentence><sentence id="138">Our Latin teacher was an elderly gentleman, in fact was the only teacher with whom, to whom my mother took me after I left <span class="building">school</span>, very, from one day to the next, to say goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="139">And he lived only a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> away from us and we went there and he was, I still remember, very nice to me and shook my hand and wished me all the best of luck for my future. </sentence><sentence id="140">So, I think some of the older teachers were definitely not  Nazis and most of the younger ones were. </sentence><sentence id="141">In addition, of course, the principal who was an elderly gentleman, he must have been already in his late 50's at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: How did you feel hearing these remarks by your teachers? </sentence><sentence id="143">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: I felt hurt, basically. </sentence><sentence id="147">I felt that, I mean, it was really like a physical slap in the face, except this was not physical but emotional. </sentence><sentence id="148">I mean, I felt, even at that time, that the men had no reason to attack me that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Did you talk about this with your parents? </sentence><sentence id="153">Did they make some sense out of it for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: I don't remember it, but it's possible that I did. </sentence><sentence id="157">I don't, I mean there are many things that I don't really understand about my parents and I feel in a way terrible about it. </sentence><sentence id="158">Of course, in the beginning I was too little, but later on I was a teenager and then finally an upper teenager and even 20 years old by the time they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="159">And, but I don't really understand many of the actions they took and their motivations. </sentence><sentence id="160">That is one of the things I have been trying for years and years sort of to reconstruct, no understanding now how they thought and what their mental sort of outlook was to explain why they acted the way they did. </sentence><sentence id="161">It's very difficult, for example, my father's decision during the first years of Hitler not to emigrate was based, that is one thing, one of the few things I can understand, as strange as it may sound. </sentence><sentence id="162">But the thing was that Jewish lawyers, a large group of, the majority Jewish lawyers were disbarred within a few weeks after the Nazis took power. </sentence><sentence id="163">There were two groups of lawyers which were exempted, one were the <span class="dlf">front line</span> soldiers from World War I, which my father was not, the other one were lawyers who had already been admitted to the <span class="building">bar</span> under the Kaiser, that means before the outbreak of World War I and that's the category my father fell in. </sentence><sentence id="164">And many of the  lawyers who were then disbarred lost their livelihood over night and the only thing they could do, unless they wanted to dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, was to emigrate, and most of them did. </sentence><sentence id="165">On the other hand, my father always considered himself lucky that he was exempted because at each stage of the Nazi development of their antisemitic policies, the Jews always were under the illusion that this is the way, okay, the Nazis want to do business and that's, but we can live with it and that's the way it's going to remain. </sentence><sentence id="166">In retrospect, the fact that my father was in one of the exempted groups, was not his luck, but it was his death sentence because otherwise he would have left <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">In fact, one remark I still remember vividly, when the others urged him to emigrate, he would say, here I am a lawyer, if I go to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, all I can become is a <span class="spatial object">dishwasher</span>, and what shall I do with German law in <span class="populated place">New York</span>? </sentence><sentence id="168">You know, logically, that made total sense, in "35, who would have ever thought of <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>? </sentence><sentence id="169">Plus, the thought also was that since Hitler was constantly breaking agreements with the Allies, and particularly with <span class="country">Britain</span> and <span class="country">France</span>, that one of these days they would have enough and just take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="170">At that time, their military force was still much bigger than that of <span class="country">Germany</span> and my father thought if I stay here, then I'll just pick up where I left off in "33 and all of that, you know, if I think back, really made sense. </sentence><sentence id="171">In the framework, I mean putting myself into the framework of my parents at that time and, of course, ignoring the history that occurred later which you know is just hindsight. </sentence><sentence id="172">I mean, obviously, my parents also were, and that may have been in general in those days, very sort of withdrawn in terms of say financial things and so on. </sentence><sentence id="173">I mean, they never discussed any of these things with us even as I got older, but I am now certain, looking back that the income of my father from his <span class="building">law practice</span>, must have plummeted. </sentence><sentence id="174">Because, first of all, many of his clients were  0 gentiles and there was, if a German gentile, so called Aryan, appeared in <span class="building">court</span> with a Jewish lawyer, that already was not one strike, but 10 strikes against him. </sentence><sentence id="175">And most of the judges were fierce Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="176">So, who would want a Jewish lawyer? </sentence><sentence id="177">And so I'm sure that most of the non-Jewish clients must have left him. </sentence><sentence id="178">Of course, he may have picked up some Jewish clients because from those Jewish lawyers who were disbarred, I don't know how that evened out, but I'm fairly certain that his income must have declined after "33.He had actually a very well going practice, he had, I remember he used to talk about one of the most famous German movie actresses he represented in her divorce and then he had some members of the Hohenzollern family, that was the family of the last German Kaiser. </sentence><sentence id="179">In fact, the nephew of the Kaiser and his mother who was a sister-in-law of the Kaiser, were his clients. </sentence><sentence id="180">And, in fact, they stuck with him until the end, that's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="181">But his, their cases did never involve court appearances, he drew up personal wills for them and made property arrangements and advice and things like that, where he didn't really appear in public for them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Let me ask you, Hitler came to power, can you kind of describe to me the progression of events and regulations and policy that altered your life and your lifestyle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: In the beginning, I must say also one thing, is my parents, in retrospect, must have made heroic efforts to insulate us children from all of these events. </sentence><sentence id="212">Initially, we didn't notice anything, in fact, that is a little story that I didn't really plan to tell you, but I was, in January of "33, I was 10 years old then and I had scarlet fever, it's a childhood disease which doesn't exist anymore, but in those days kids had it. </sentence><sentence id="213">And our pediatrician who was also a distant relative, it was still in the days of <span class="building">house</span> calls, came every day and looked me over, looked into my throat and so on, and he came at a certain time, in the morning at  1 some point. </sentence><sentence id="214">And it was sort of a regular routine, the bell would ring, my mother would come into my <span class="interior space">room</span> with him and then he would examine me. </sentence><sentence id="215">On one day, and now I know it was the 30th of January, 1933, instead of coming in, my mother and he were outside the <span class="dlf">door</span> of my <span class="interior space">room</span>, but with the <span class="dlf">door</span> closed, and sort of in a low voice which I couldn't understand, kept talking and talking and talking. </sentence><sentence id="216">And finally they came in and I was very sort of disappointed, not only because of the change in routine, but somehow I wasn't that important and they talked and then I asked them what's the matter, and my mother said in a grave voice, Hitler has just been appointed Chancellor. </sentence><sentence id="217">And at that time, it sort of went in here, out there, it didn't mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="218">I knew I was 10 years old, so I, the German, there had been several elections before so the <span class="building">house</span> walls and <span class="building">public places</span> were plastered with election placards and so I remember having seen, vote for Hitler and vote for Tahlmann who was the Communist party leader, and vote for this man, and <span class="country">Germany</span> also had many parties. </sentence><sentence id="219">And, so vaguely the name Hitler rang a bell, but I had no idea basically who he was, what he stood for and so on. </sentence><sentence id="220">Now, coming specifically to your question, the first real change was that eviction from the <span class="building">Mommsen Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">Before that, the laws, there were laws of course, as I said, about disbarring lawyers, didn't affect me and, unfortunately, it did not affect my father either. </sentence><sentence id="222">Then there were many other, there weren't too many laws, until "35, in "35 the so called Nuremberg laws were passed which actually defined Jews as second class citizens, but that also had no immediate effect, the main effect was also that Jews not only could not marry gentiles, I mean, Aryan gentiles, but even the act of intercourse without being married was a punishable offense, but obviously, I was 12, 13 years old then, that was the last thing on my mind. </sentence><sentence id="223">And second class citizenship had, of course, trickled through and had many  2 other effects which at that point did not affect me. </sentence><sentence id="224">But, as I said, the eviction from the <span class="building">school</span> did and but also, our lifestyle never changed, I mean we went, my parents went on their summer vacations and my sister and I went to our <span class="populated place">camps</span> and we had, I mean we were clothed, we had food to eat and, in fact, oh yeah, one big change also was that the Nazis were totally obsessed with the idea that the Jews were sort of spoiling the German race and most Jewish families, at least middle and upper middle classes, had maids and in those days maids were usually live-in maids, and one of the outgrowths of the Nuremberg laws was that any <span class="building">Jewish household</span> which has a male, a Jewish male in the <span class="building">household</span>, was forbidden to have a German maid who is below 45 years of age. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, we had, I think we had one at that time so we had to dismiss her and took an older woman. </sentence><sentence id="226">You could take an older one, I mean it was all that obsession with that maybe a Jew would then father an illegitimate child with such a maid. </sentence><sentence id="227">I don't know, maybe there were such cases, but they were, it was almost a sickness with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="228">Anyway, I then started at the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> and I remember there were several kids besides myself in my grade who started new there. </sentence><sentence id="229">Now, we were up to grade level in all the general subjects like math, German and so on, but in the Jewish subjects, and particularly in Hebrew, our classmates were already freely translating the Torah, the Tenach, the entire bible, from English, from Hebrew into German, and I could barely sort of read stammeringly and so did the others. </sentence><sentence id="230">So they instituted a sort of second track Hebrew for us assimilated kids; and for the first class the principal, a Dr. Schlesinger came in to give us a little pep talk about the importance of knowing Hebrew for Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="231">And after he was finished, he said, okay, tomorrow will be the first, now he dismissed us, tomorrow will be the first real class and we are supposed to bring, he wrote on the board a certain grammar by so and so  3 which you could buy at some <span class="building">book store</span> that he named, and a copy of the Chumash. </sentence><sentence id="232">And as soon as he said that, my arm shot up and he pointed at me and I asked, what is a <span class="building">Chumash</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">And that question completely floored that principal. </sentence><sentence id="234">He couldn't imagine a Jewish boy asking, being so unbelievably ignorant that he wouldn't know what a Chumash is. </sentence><sentence id="235">And so all he could, yeah and also, he was a short, very thin, wiry man with a reddish goatee, bald head but a fringe of red hair around the back of his head and his entire head, as I remember it, turned red just as his beard, he walked toward me and finally, I guess he took some time to think about what to say, and then he said, you are a Jew and you don't know what a Chumash is? </sentence><sentence id="236">And, of course, that question totally demolished me and I sat down and felt as if I had said something. . . </sentence><sentence id="237">End of side one of tape one.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997, tape one, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Yeah, my immediate reaction was that I was totally embarrassed by the principal's remark and, but soon, as a result of the very strong Jewish education which was part of the curriculum in that <span class="building">school</span>, I started to become more and more interested in that. </sentence><sentence id="268">The name of the <span class="building">school</span>, actually that is very important, was <span class="building">Adass Jisroel</span>, it means <span class="building">Jewish Congregation</span>, a Jewish Community. </sentence><sentence id="269">And we came to the point even where I decided that I wanted to become a rabbi when I grew up, which very much upset my father, particularly. </sentence><sentence id="270">I started to go regularly to Shabbat services in. * * * </sentence><sentence id="271"><span class="populated place">Berlin</span> had many <span class="building">synagogues</span> and, as I said before, there was only one congregation which ran all of the <span class="building">synagogues</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and also the rabbis, therefore, were not confined to one <span class="building">synagogue</span>, so one didn't have to put up with the same rabbi Shabbat after Shabbat the way it is here, for example, in this <span class="country">country</span>, where each <span class="building">congregation</span> has its own rabbi, but instead, the  4 rabbis circulated. </sentence><sentence id="272">But, obviously, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> is a big <span class="populated place">city</span> and it was taken for granted that they would take <span class="spatial object">public transport</span> to go to the various <span class="building">synagogues</span> which were widely scattered in different parts of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">So, I particularly became very fond of two rabbis who were both very dynamic and also gave me a lot of moral support in their sermons. </sentence><sentence id="274">One was Dr. Max Nussbaum who later emigrated to this <span class="country">country</span> and became rabbi in <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span>, <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">And the other one was Dr. Manfred Swarsenski who came to this <span class="country">country</span> and actually founded a <span class="building">synagogue</span> in <span class="populated place">Madison</span>, <span class="region">Wisconsin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">I never saw Nussbaum again, but <span class="building">Swarsenski</span> I visited in the mid-"60's when I went to a scientific conference in <span class="populated place">Madison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">I knew he was there so I contacted him before and we set up a luncheon, we spent several hours together just talking and reminiscing. </sentence><sentence id="278">I, yeah, in that, so the years went by from "35 to "38 and by 1938, I must have been about in 10th grade and in October, 1938, the German police arrested all Jews who had Polish passports, overnight, without any prior warning, in fact, they came in the early morning hours. </sentence><sentence id="279">And put them on, into <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> which were all ready prepared beforehand and they were shipped off to <span class="country">Poland</span> and the only thing the German saw to it was that they had their Polish passports with them because by International law, the Poles had to admit anyone who had a valid Polish passport. </sentence><sentence id="280">And there were quite a number of kids from my <span class="building">class</span> affected by that and even a few teachers who didn't appear the next day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: What were you thinking when all this was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: It was terrible, I mean, I still remember, I mean these kids, that was actually the first fore taste of the later deportations. </sentence><sentence id="298">I mean, people just vanished overnight, the day before nobody knew anything, they didn't know, we didn't know and on the next day, they just didn't appear in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">Our Hebrew teacher was one of them and then several kids, one  5 of them, but that's beside the point here, I met again 30 years later in <span class="country">Israel</span> where he is, by now he must be retired, he was a professor of classical languages at <span class="building">Hebrew University</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: What's surprising me about what you're telling me, is that you, what I'm understanding here is that until 1938, your life went on pretty much the way it had before except for that you changed <span class="building">schools</span>? </sentence><sentence id="304">You haven't described any real hardships or laws or regulations that affected you personally. </sentence><sentence id="305">Is that true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: That's true. </sentence><sentence id="310">I mean, that was my, I mean first of all, it's 50, 60 years later, what I remember, but I think my memory is pretty good as far as that is concerned, that doesn't mean that these regulations didn't exist, but they didn't really touch me personally and, as I said, after I've read a lot of what happened in those days, and I see now that my parents must have made a monumental effort to keep things away from us, that's the only explanation I have. </sentence><sentence id="311">One thing that I noticed also maybe in my life, and that was that earlier, I think in either late "37 or early "38, all <span class="building">Jewish stores</span> were required to put the names of their owners in letters of a prescribed size on the <span class="dlf">store window</span> in, and not in an artistic way, so in a way that identified the <span class="building">store</span> as a <span class="building">Jewish store</span> because no other <span class="building">store</span>, in white paint of a prescribed size, but again, we didn't have a <span class="building">store</span>, I just noticed it, that this is what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="312">Another thing that happened also, was that all Jews were forced to adopt an additional middle name, males the name <span class="country">Israel</span> and females the name Sara. </sentence><sentence id="313">In this <span class="country">country</span> there are many non-Jews, Jewish women, who are called Sarah, but in <span class="country">Germany</span>, the name Sarah is totally unknown, it was purely a Jewish name and <span class="country">Israel</span>, anyway, so, and also the law stipulated not only that we had to take those names, but that we had to use it, particularly in all communications with <span class="building">government agencies</span> or also  6 with <span class="building">commercial enterprises</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="314">Like, I had to call myself Ernest Israel Fontheim, written out. </sentence><sentence id="315">And my father had to do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was, of course, also a humiliation and in addition to that, it was a sort of signal for the recipient, this is a Jew who is writing to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Could you play in <span class="dlf">public parks</span>, could you ride the <span class="spatial object">busses</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: You could do all this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Right, at that time there were no restrictions of any sort to our life, we could go to <span class="building">movies</span>, <span class="building">theaters</span>, I could go to, now there were places which on their own initiative, had posted signs, Jews, "Juden unerwiinscht", that means Jews are not desired here, actually to translate it literally, but what it means really, Jews forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="332">That was already, there were, for example, many <span class="spatial object">benches</span> on <span class="dlf">parks</span>, because again the Nazis with their obsession with sex, had that idea that maybe a German woman might sit on a <span class="spatial object">park bench</span> and then some Jewish man might sit next to her and start to, some dirty business with her and so a German woman cannot be expected to sit next to a Jew on a <span class="spatial object">park bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">But whatever, that started up and then, as I said, certain, maybe some <span class="building">restaurants</span>, but we didn't go much to <span class="building">restaurants</span> anyway, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Did you know about the book, that huge <span class="spatial object">book</span> burning earlier? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: At that time, I don't remember it, I remember it, obviously having read about it, but that happened I think in "33 or "34 and I was 10 or 11 years old and so. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: So your family insulated you to the extent that you weren't particularly distressed or fearful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: That's correct, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="344"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Could you sense any change in your parents or relatives or friends? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Oh, yeah, I mean that I should mention. </sentence><sentence id="347">They were, there was a stream of people who emigrated, you know, some uncle, some cousin, you know, and there was always farewells and friends of mine, their parents emigrated and, of course, the kid then went along. </sentence><sentence id="348">I should say I had a best friend in this <span class="building">Adass Jisroel school</span>, he was a boy, a very interesting boy, in fact, we became best friends initially because we both were new in that <span class="building">class</span>, but from totally different backgrounds. </sentence><sentence id="349">He came, his parents had moved from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they were Austrian Jews, but the parents were, of course, born before World War [ like all of our parents and before World War I, the <span class="country">Austro-Hungarian Empire</span> included <span class="region">southern Poland</span> and particularly, most of <span class="region">Galicia</span>, the <span class="region">province</span>, and his parents actually were orthodox Jews from <span class="country">Galicia</span> who had, however, left there I think before the war already and settled in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and so they were then, by citizenship, they were Austrian Jews and they came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, it might sound strange since <span class="country">Austria</span> at that time was still a democracy, but his father had some business, I think he sort of administered <span class="building">buildings</span> and as an Austrian, he was not subject, he was a foreigner, foreign Jews were not subject to all these antisemitic laws. </sentence><sentence id="350">So we, and in fact, this friend also influenced me in that, and I took him also to services to a <span class="building">liberal synagogue</span> with the <span class="spatial object">organ</span> and he found that very impressive and so we influenced each other. </sentence><sentence id="351">And we stuck together, he was a very bright boy and on the 13th of March, 1938, that was the day Hitler marched into <span class="country">Austria</span>, I'll never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="352">I visited him, I saw his father sit in the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> with his head in his hands like that and crying because he knew that his game was up now, now he was also a German and subject to all the laws. </sentence><sentence id="353">And to see a father cry is an incredibly powerful experience for and also a devastating experience for a  8 boy. </sentence><sentence id="354">Totally devastating. </sentence><sentence id="355">And then the parents finally decided to send their boy out to <span class="country">England</span>, you may know, <span class="country">England</span> had relatively liberal immigration for Jewish children and they, they were of course orthodox, and they enrolled him in a <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> in <span class="country">Scotland</span> and ostensibly for him to become a rabbi which he never did, but that was the rules under which he could get out and into <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">And that was actually the first personal blow in my life. </sentence><sentence id="357">And also for that reason, I never forgot the date, it was January 18, 1938. </sentence><sentence id="358">And I was at the <span class="building">railroad station</span> together with his parents, of course, to say goodbye and he was my best friend and I lost him. </sentence><sentence id="359">But, of course, the year 1938 then had many other, all of those things happening, I mentioned the arrest and deportation of the Polish Jews and then just a few weeks later, two or three weeks later, came the infamous Kristallnacht Pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="360">Of course, the two events were not unrelated. </sentence><sentence id="361">Among the people who were arbitrarily arrested and shipped to <span class="country">Poland</span> was an elderly couple, Grynszpan, who, and the Poles, of course, claimed they didn't know what to do with all those Jews, so they put them into <span class="populated place">camps</span> in inhuman conditions and they had lived in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I'm not sure whether in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> or some other <span class="populated place">city</span>, anyway, they had a son, Herschel, whom they had sent to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to relatives because it became, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> became too oppressive, and he lived with an uncle in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">And when the parents wrote to him a letter of desperation and he became so furious he obtained a gun and decided to assassinate the German ambassador to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, but you know, if a 16 year old boy enters an <span class="building">embassy</span> and says he wants to talk to the ambassador, that's not whom he's going to see, obviously, and so they ushered him into some underling from, a consular secretary or something, his name was Ernst vom Rath, and history probably would never know him if it hadn't been for Grynszpan to pull his pistol and assassinate him there. </sentence><sentence id="363">And the German government, on the other hand,  9 used that as a pretext to stage these pogroms and that was starting the night, from November 9th to 10th, for several days. </sentence><sentence id="364">I mean, <span class="building">synagogues</span> were burned, <span class="building">Jewish shops</span> and now, of course, you see, since the <span class="building">Jewish shops</span> all had to be labeled with the names of the owner, it never said <span class="building">Jewish shop</span>, but it was known that the <span class="building">stores</span> which had the name of the owner in this particular prescribed way, these were the <span class="building">Jewish stores</span> so it was clear for the mob which <span class="dlf">windows</span> to smash and loot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: What were you doing during the time of Kristallnacht, what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Yeah, on that day in the morning, where we lived there were, at least on my way to the <span class="building">station</span>, I had to take a <span class="spatial object">commuter train</span> to the <span class="populated place">city</span>, to that <span class="building">school</span>, I didn't pass any <span class="building">shops</span>, they were all just <span class="building">apartment houses</span>, so I knew nothing. </sentence><sentence id="387">That was the morning of the 10th, now, it was a Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="388">So I took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and I went to <span class="building">school</span> and as soon as I was in the <span class="building">school</span>, I realized what was on, first of all, many kids weren't there and those who were there told horror stories of passing <span class="building">shops</span> that had been smashed and looted. </sentence><sentence id="389">And then the next thing that was unusual is, as you know, the <span class="building">school</span> day starts at eight sharp, the bell is ringing and then the normal thing would be that the teacher would appear at the crack of the <span class="spatial object">bell</span>, no teacher not just in our <span class="building">class</span>, but in the neighboring, in no <span class="building">class</span> any teacher was to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="390">And after some time, I don't remember it was a half an hour, whatever, all the teachers came from the teacher's <span class="interior space">conference room</span> with the following instructions, that there was unrest all over <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and the safety of the <span class="building">school</span> cannot be guaranteed and furthermore, we should go <span class="building">home</span> but we should go <span class="building">home</span> alone, if we go in groups that might attract mobs and just a single boy, you know, can sort of slip under, unrecognized and also we should not go to friends because our parents might get worried, we should only go the shortest way and fastest way <span class="building">home</span> so the parents  0 know we are safe, and there won't be any <span class="building">school</span> for the time being, we will be notified when the <span class="building">school</span> will start up again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: So you went <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="399">The <span class="spatial object">commuter train</span> was an <span class="spatial object">elevated train</span> and it passed by the <span class="building">synagogue</span> where I had my bar mitzvah and what I saw there was really one of the worst horror shocks in my life. </sentence><sentence id="400">It was a beautiful <span class="building">building</span> with huge, three huge <span class="interior space">domes</span>, sort of in Moorish style and from the <span class="interior space">center dome</span> came a huge thick column of smoke. </sentence><sentence id="401">When I saw that I became so obsessed that I forgot the warning that was given to us to go straight <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">At the next <span class="spatial object">train</span> stop I left the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and I raced back to the <span class="building">building</span>, to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and what I saw there is there was a mob of people across the <span class="dlf">street</span>, held back by a <span class="dlf">police line</span> and the fire department was there hosing down adjacent <span class="building">buildings</span> so to prevent the flames from doing damage to <span class="dlf">German property</span> and no hose was directed at the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and that, I just stood there, I was totally sort of hypnotized. </sentence><sentence id="403">That was something; I couldn't even imagine that something like that could happen. </sentence><sentence id="404">And then, there were many antisemitic sort of shouts from the mob, I mean like, I don't know, throw out the Jews or kill the Jews and it never occurred to me that I was one in the middle of that mob. </sentence><sentence id="405">And then suddenly somebody said that in the <span class="building">house</span> where, against which the mob was sort of standing looking at the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, on the <span class="interior space">ground floor</span> somebody knew there was a Jew living. </sentence><sentence id="406">So there were immediate shouts, let's get them. </sentence><sentence id="407">And then the mob turned its back to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and burst into the <span class="building">house</span> itself and then I heard sort of heavy blows against the <span class="dlf">apartment door</span> and I was way outside, I couldn't see what was happening there. </sentence><sentence id="408">And all I could think was, I hope that the <span class="dlf">door</span> is going to hold and I remember that was sort of as if I was trying to influence the <span class="dlf">door</span> to hold, but of course, it  1 didn't and I could hear sort of splintering wood and then after that there was total silence, it lasted for minutes, not a sound. </sentence><sentence id="409">And then I heard again shouts like, get them, get them, and then there was an elderly man, all I remember seeing, he had a huge bald head, he was probably sixty, or I don't know how old he was, and then from all sides there were blows and his face soon was completely bloodied. </sentence><sentence id="410">And suddenly there was a young man who shouted, you cowards, so many all fighting against one single guy. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then some others tried to attack that man and sort of pushed him away. </sentence><sentence id="412">And then once he was pushed through the crowd, there was police already waiting in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> as if this was all staged, I have no idea and he was pushed off into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and the police drove him off. </sentence><sentence id="413">And after I saw that, I turned around and went back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">So the year 1938 was really for me, it was a big turning point. </sentence><sentence id="415">It started out with the emigration of my best friend which was a tremendous personal loss for me, then the arrest of the Polish Jews, who I also knew quite a number including some of my teachers and then the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="416">So I stayed <span class="building">home</span> as we were told on Friday. </sentence><sentence id="417">And on Saturday one of my friends had a birthday party that already was long planned and so I went to it, and we had hardly come there when somebody, I think one of the boys came in saying that his father had just been arrested by the Gestapo and that the Gestapo is arresting the Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="418">So the party never took place, we all immediately raced, in those days, Saturday was a weekday, so my father was in his <span class="building">office</span> and actually it was not too far, it was several <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from where the birthday party was supposed to take place. </sentence><sentence id="419">So I raced to his <span class="building">office</span> and just when I came in, he said he had just received an urgent telephone call from a colleague, a German, an Aryan colleague to see him immediately on an important matter and he asked me to come along. </sentence><sentence id="420">I was at that time 16 years old and so we went, that  2 colleague was two <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from my father's <span class="building">office</span> and was a certain Dr. Kiilz. </sentence><sentence id="421">He was a few years somewhat younger than my father and his father, Dr. Kiilz's father, had also himself been a lawyer, but more importantly, he had been Minister of the Interior in one of the pre-Hitler governments of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> and in <span class="country">Germany</span>, like I think in many <span class="country">European countries</span>, the police is within the <span class="building">Interior Ministry</span> sort of an agency, I mean like somewhat comparable to the FBI here, which is in the <span class="building">Justice Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="422">But there the police, the entire police organization, is national, it's not local like in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">And anyway, the father still had close contacts to high police officials and had learned, therefore, of this action against, for the arrest of Jewish men and in those days, also, everybody was paranoiac, partly with justification, that the Gestapo was listening on telephone calls, so therefore, the son who my father actually knew the son better than the father, who had, I think, done legal cases together with him, and the son did not say anything over the phone, just told my father to see him in his <span class="building">office</span> on an important matter. </sentence><sentence id="424">And my father then was ushered in and asked me to stay outside in the <span class="interior space">waiting room</span> and they were quite a time together there and then they came out again and my father told me that that lawyer had warned him not to go back to his <span class="building">office</span> or, of course, not to his own <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and to, it is safe, however, to stay at places where there are no Jewish males. </sentence><sentence id="425">Fortunately, my father's sister, who was a widow and she had three children, two daughters and a son. </sentence><sentence id="426">One daughter had already emigrated to <span class="country">Argentina</span>, and the son had just left a few months or so before Kristallnacht also for <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="427">So it was just his sister and the remaining daughter. </sentence><sentence id="428">So in other words, there were no males in that <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="429">So my father immediately went there, and the Gestapo came both to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and also to the <span class="building">office</span> to inquire and, of course, we told them he left and didn't  3 tell us where he was going, and in those days the Gestapo still took these relatively stupid excuses and just reappeared a few random times maybe hoping to catch him, but didn't, and that was the second great stroke of luck that my father had after having been permitted to practice law. </sentence><sentence id="430">The thing was that the Gestapo immediately let it be known that those Jews who were arrested were put into <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, with the <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> Jews mainly in the camp <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> which is north of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">And the treatment, of course, was horrible, full of sadism and physical brutality. </sentence><sentence id="432">However, in those days at least there was no killing, no mass killings, I think a few Jews actually did die due to just mistreatment, but I mean which is horrible enough in its own right, but at least most survived and the Gestapo let it be known that anyone whose family can produce an emigration visa to another <span class="country">country</span> will be immediately released and will have to leave the <span class="country">country</span> within one month, giving him one month's time to wind up affairs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="433">So, but as I said, my father was lucky, he was warned, he was never arrested and, of course, the Jewish relief organizations from the Joint here in <span class="country">America</span> to the local ones in <span class="country">Germany</span>, now put high pressure on and the first priority to get those Jews immigration visas to somewhere, anywhere in

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="472">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean that is, no Gestapo, by its very nature is a secret police, they were in civilian and they were, I mean not conspicuous, even though they themselves were everywhere and they had a whole army of informers who were not actually Gestapo but reported to them. </sentence><sentence id="473">And that was a <span class="dlf">network</span>, throughout <span class="country">Germany</span>, maybe I neglected  4 to say that, that belongs much earlier. </sentence><sentence id="474">As soon as Hitler assumed power, there were frequent marches by the SA on, they had a fascination with marches, as I said, this <span class="building">Mommsen Gymnasium</span>, after that Nazi officer took over, one of the things he introduced, as I explained, was during the lunch hour, after eating lunch, we always marched around the <span class="dlf">street</span> singing songs. </sentence><sentence id="475">But the SA, at every, whatever occasion or even no occasion, they would march around and one of their favorite songs, incidentally, was "Und wenn das Judenblut vom <span class="spatial object">Messer</span> spritzt, dann geht's nochmal so gut." </sentence><sentence id="476">which translated means, if Jewish blood squirts from the <span class="spatial object">knives</span> then things will go quite as well. </sentence><sentence id="477">I mean, to sing a song like that, I mean I listened to it even at that time, but the older I get, the more incredible it seems to me that somebody, I mean even who hates some group, to make that into a song is so unbelievable that it defies description. </sentence><sentence id="478">Another song which was a favorite was, I'll say it in German first, "Wir werden weiter marschieren, auch wenn alles in <span class="populated place">Scherben</span> fallt, denn heute gehoert uns <span class="country">Deutschland</span> und morgen die ganze Welt." </sentence><sentence id="479">that means, we will continue to march and even if everything breaks down and falls into pieces, because today <span class="country">Germany</span> belongs to us and tomorrow the entire world. </sentence><sentence id="480">And so, and they had all kinds of other songs, obviously, I mean these are the things that I never forgot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: So even if you were insulated, this had to be fairly alarming. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Yeah, I mean I found it, I mean there were other things that were alarming also. </sentence><sentence id="498">There was a weekly newspaper called <span class="building">Der Stiirmer</span>, the storm trooper, maybe you've  5 heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="499">It was published by the Nazi governor of the <span class="region">province of Franconia</span>, a man named Julius Streicher, and which was full of antisemitic articles and also totally fixated on the sexual aspect of antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="500">The paper, I mean apparently calling to that Jews had infinite sexual appetites and particularly for little innocent blond German girls to seduce them, that was somehow a Jewish command to do that, I mean it was just incredible, I mean the man must have been sick himself, or whoever wrote these stories. </sentence><sentence id="501">And, of course, sometimes they were true. </sentence><sentence id="502">They would intermix it with some true stories, where sometimes a Jew was convicted of some crime. </sentence><sentence id="503">Usually the crimes Jews were convicted of were such things as smuggling money out. </sentence><sentence id="504">In <span class="country">Germany</span> foreign exchange was strictly controlled, because the whole economy was managed and controlled, but you know Jews, rather than letting the Nazis take it all away from them, sometimes tried to smuggle some money out and in some cases they succeeded and in other cases they were caught, and that was always touted as a big crime against the <span class="country">German nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="505">And of course, the story always was that the Jew, they came with nothing and now they are rich, so that is all just taken away from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="506">And stories like that, and then of course, there were also true stories of where a Jew somehow was caught having had a relationship with a non-Jewish girl and if that happened, then the Jew usually came to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and those Jews who were there for, there was actually a term, a German term for that, which translated means sort of defilement of the race. </sentence><sentence id="507">And they were mercilessly tortured and punished and usually, if they weren't shot outright, just died of torture. </sentence><sentence id="508">So that newspaper was not just sold at <span class="building">newsstands</span>, but they had sort of display cases on various strategic points, like in busy <span class="building">railroad stations</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="509">And  6 usually I ignored it, but sometimes I sort of went there and read it and somehow I did not relate it to me, it's a funny thing. </sentence><sentence id="510">End of tape one Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. </sentence><sentence id="527">The interviewer is Randy Goldman, this is tape two, side A. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: What I, what affected me actually more than these vicious articles in the <span class="building">Stiirmer</span>, were antisemitic articles in the general press and I also felt at that time and still feel today, that they probably were much more effective in influencing people than the <span class="building">Stiirmer</span> articles because the articles in the <span class="building">Stiirmer</span>, most of them at least, were so outlandish that, and also they were always accompanied by horrible caricatures where a Jew looked like a, maybe a mixture of a gorilla and a human being and totally distorted, that I am sure many people just couldn't take it seriously, on the other hand, that antisemitic articles in the general press, which were more sort of subdued and not as outwardly ridiculous, and therefore, also probably appeared more reasonable, probably influenced many more people toward increased antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="531">And they were, for example, I have to admit that to some extent, even I was influenced by the constant refrain of the German press was that the Jews were in charge of all the <span class="country">countries</span> that were fighting against <span class="country">Germany</span>, particularly of course, the United <span class="country">States</span>, and there was a whole succession of names that always appeared, one was that, of course, of Felix Frankfurter, the supreme court justice, another one was Herbert Lehman, the governor of the state of <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I remember, and there were one or two others. </sentence><sentence id="532">Oh, yeah, of course, Bernard Baruch, the financier and they made it appear as if they are, these people  7 were sort of behind the scenes manipulating and, of course, Roosevelt himself, whose name was often distorted as Rosenfeld, implying that if he wasn't a Jew at least he was of Jewish descent. </sentence><sentence id="533">And after the war, particularly after meeting American soldiers, and many of them Jewish, I was surprised actually to hear that there was large scale antisemitism in this <span class="country">country</span> and that the influence of these Jews was a relatively minimal. </sentence><sentence id="534">Oh, I forgot one name, of course, that was Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the Treasury at that time. </sentence><sentence id="535">He was probably, I would say, from what I can judge reading history, the most influential, in the government at least, of the <span class="country">United States</span> and I think he was fairly close to President Roosevelt. </sentence><sentence id="536">But it was nothing like that and as the Nazis, and I was, I have to admit now, disappointed because somehow that part of the Nazi propaganda I had started to believe somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="537">And then, by the way, the same thing in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, you know, there were lots of Jewish names, many of these were actually exterminated by Stalin himself, and particularly, many of the original revolutionaries, and starting with Trotsky, of course. </sentence><sentence id="538">And there too, actually, the fact that there was wide spread antisemitism in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, never made it into the German papers, it wouldn't have fit their purposes. </sentence><sentence id="539">Okay, now, the Kristallnacht was not only a, just devastating horrible event in my personal life as well as the lives of all Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but it represented a watershed because that was followed by a avalanche of new laws and regulations totally restricting Jews. </sentence><sentence id="540">What affected us first of all was that the remaining Jewish lawyers were now disbarred. </sentence><sentence id="541">So suddenly my father was not only living in an antisemitic hotbed like <span class="country">Germany</span>, but on top of it, he was unemployed here and my parents made, then from then on really, desperate efforts to get out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">And, but it was, by that time everybody had woken up and I remember once standing in  8 front of the <span class="building">British Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which was in the <span class="building">embassy compound</span>, arriving there at six in the morning, just to get some form to fill out and I think by eleven or twelve or so, finally it was my turn to receive those <span class="spatial object">forms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">I don't know what ever happened, but I don't think, but obviously they didn't go to <span class="country">England</span> and neither did I, so I stood there for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="544">And then, also, that was followed by laws making it illegal for a Jew to visit any place of amusement or entertainment or general culture, that included the whole spectrum, I mean from <span class="building">theater</span>, symphony, opera to circuses, <span class="building">county fairs</span> kind of thing, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="545">Also, <span class="dlf">public beaches</span>, swimming, <span class="interior space">public swimming pools</span>, <span class="building">movie theaters</span>, <span class="dlf">public parks</span> even. </sentence><sentence id="546"><span class="dlf">Parks</span> were much more popular in <span class="country">Germany</span> than they are here because most people in this <span class="country">country</span>, or at least a high proportion, live in their own <span class="building">homes</span> and have their own <span class="dlf">gardens</span>, in <span class="country">Germany</span> the vast majority, at least at that time, lived in <span class="building">apartments</span> and so <span class="dlf">parks</span> were visited by people just regularly, just for recreation, just like people here might just sit in their <span class="interior space">back yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="547">Anyway, they were now outlawed for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="548">I, from the beginning, I and all of my friends, totally ignored the, that law and we just kept going. </sentence><sentence id="549">I remember one rather humorous incident, in the summer of 1940, the <span class="building">Rome State Opera</span> from <span class="populated place">Rome</span>, <span class="country">Italy</span>, gave a one week guest appearance at the <span class="building">Berlin State Opera</span> and I had been an opera fan and on the day when the ticket sales started for the <span class="building">Rome Opera</span>, obviously everybody knew you had to be there early, so I was there, I think, at five in the morning or so, and there was already a long <span class="dlf">line</span>, and while you stand in <span class="dlf">line</span>, of course, for hours, sort of trotting from left leg to right leg and vice versa, you start also with people around you to get acquainted and talk and so on and the advantage of that was that you could then ask somebody to hold your place while you, it's just easier to take a little walk than to stand at the same spot, so I did that also. </sentence><sentence id="550">And while I then  9 took my walk, I walked along the <span class="dlf">line</span> and I saw three other boys from my <span class="building">Jewish high school</span> <span class="interior space">classroom</span> and it was sort of an unwritten law, you know, one Jew might get away, two Jews is already like a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, so we just waved at each other with a grin, without really getting together. </sentence><sentence id="551">And most people I knew did that, but there was a danger. </sentence><sentence id="552">I mean, if the Gestapo caught somebody, I mean the least thing was a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, but as a young person, first of all, I was always sort of defying authority and plus, a young person is always more reckless than an older one. </sentence><sentence id="553">Yeah, let me, actually, in my personal life, what happened then, finally the <span class="building">schools</span> were permitted to operate again and, but then, shortly, that was probably late "38, that date I don't quite remember any more precisely, but then in early "39, most Jewish <span class="building">schools</span> were closed by the Gestapo, including the <span class="building">Adass Jisroel school</span>, to which I was going. </sentence><sentence id="554">And there was only one <span class="building">Jewish high school</span> left operating and that was the official <span class="building">high school</span> of the Jewish community of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but by that time, my parents were really in high gear trying to emigrate and they had the idea that it would be good for me to go to the <span class="building">American School</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">The <span class="building">American School</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, also it was very close to where we lived, it was run by an American principal and it mainly served children of diplomats, I mean not just Americans, obviously, but also British and others who would know English, and also children of businessmen who were stationed in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="556">And therefore, the tuition was, of course, very high and I remember that was the first time sort of I heard about that this was a sort of a big sacrifice for my parents to put me in that <span class="building">school</span>, and actually, I was scared because I would be thrown suddenly into a totally English environment, I mean, the teachers were all Americans, some maybe British, actually, and English was the language. </sentence><sentence id="557">Most kids had English as their native tongue and I had had three years of  0 English at the <span class="building">Adass school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">But fortunately, things turned out to be not quite as bad. </sentence><sentence id="559">It turned out the <span class="building">school</span> followed the curriculum of sort of the basic American school system and the <span class="building">German gymnasium</span> was really a much more rigorous and elitist <span class="building">school</span> and was at least a year if not more ahead of it, so many of the things, for example, in Latin and biology, I remember, we had had already much earlier, so the material itself was often, just for me, a review of things I had learned earlier and, therefore, that made it easier for me to concentrate on the language. </sentence><sentence id="560">I think I made quite a bit of progress there, I don't know exactly how long I was, I wasn't there very long, probably from about February, March "39, until the start of the summer term, which was, I think, May or June "39. </sentence><sentence id="561">In "39 also, was a lot, the first summer in my life where my parents didn't send me to a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="562">And on the first of September, 1939, of course the German Wehrmacht entered <span class="country">Poland</span>, attacked <span class="country">Poland</span>, and I still, I listened to Hitler's speech to the <span class="building">Reichstag</span> in which he explained his rationale and I never forget the words which he said, "since five o'clock this morning, we are shooting back", I mean the fairy tale that the Nazis told the world was that <span class="country">Poland</span> had attacked <span class="country">Germany</span> and that had been going on already for days and weeks, and while he patiently sort of tried to look the other way and tried to come to a peaceful solution and finally he is not taking it anymore and they are shooting back. </sentence><sentence id="563">I mean, it's unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="564">Okay, anyway, that was a Friday, September 1, and I should say actually two days before, on August 30, that was my father's birthday, 1939, must have been his 57th birthday, and at that time already everything was much more subdued and we didn't have a party at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">We just went out to some nice <span class="building">restaurant</span> <span class="populated place">downtown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="566">And while we were sitting there, suddenly a newsboy came in with stacks of news, extra editions, shouting extra, extra, you know, and every <span class="spatial object">table</span> bought a paper and  1 the big fat headline was, general mobilization in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">And so, everybody knew already, see and in <span class="country">Germany</span>, general mobilization was never officially announced because the Nazis had already quietly mobilized and then on the first, as I said, <span class="country">Germany</span> attacked <span class="country">Poland</span>, it was a Friday. </sentence><sentence id="568">On Sunday the 3rd, we took our customary Sunday excursion, we walked through the <span class="env feature">forest</span> near where we lived to one of the <span class="building">cafes</span> at the <span class="dlf">riverbank</span> of the <span class="env feature">Havel River</span> and at that time also, most if not all of the <span class="building">restaurants</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> were sort of wired for public address systems. </sentence><sentence id="569">And while we were sitting there, it was early afternoon I think, the public address system went on with an important announcement from the German government, and it said that the British Ambassador had, at 11:00, I still remember the time, submitted a diplomatic note saying that, requesting that German troops be taken back to the original <span class="dlf">German-Polish border</span> within a certain number of hours. </sentence><sentence id="570">If <span class="country">Germany</span> refused to do that, then <span class="country">Britain</span> in line with its treaty obligations to <span class="country">Poland</span>, will consider itself at war with <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="571">And the French Ambassador had submitted a similar note also. </sentence><sentence id="572">As we were sitting there, I remember that my father broke out into tears and that was the first time that I saw him cry. </sentence><sentence id="573">And he said, this is the Second World War in his lifetime and that he was not going to survive it. </sentence><sentence id="574">What prompted that remark, I never, it was the Holocaust was still so far away as to be unbelievable, but obviously, he must have sensed something. </sentence><sentence id="575">And then we went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">And then the outbreak of the war was followed then by many more restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="577">One was we had to turn in our <span class="spatial object">telephones</span>, we had to turn in all <span class="spatial object">appliances</span>, of course in those days, people had much fewer than today, but still I mean that included such things as <span class="spatial object">vacuum cleaners</span>, <span class="spatial object">phonograph players</span>, I don't know what else one had in those days, it was before  2 <span class="spatial object">washing machines</span> and <span class="spatial object">dishwashers</span>, but whatever one had, it had to be turned in. </sentence><sentence id="578">And in addition to. .. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="628">Q: <span class="spatial object">Radios</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: Oh, yeah, radio, yeah, I think radios, too, yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="631">And then some, up to that time I think Jews religiously obeyed all these things, and that was the first time where people started to sort of balk and not everything was turned in. </sentence><sentence id="632">I knew of many cases where people didn't turn in everything. </sentence><sentence id="633">Also, jewelry, valuables, you know, gold, silver, diamonds, things like that, had to be all turned in. </sentence><sentence id="634">And it was just turned in for a receipt, in other words, there was not thought of even to, for the government to buy it, it was just stolen. </sentence><sentence id="635">And of course, one victim of the outbreak of the war was the <span class="building">American School</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which did not reopen because even though <span class="country">America</span> itself at that time was not yet in the war, but <span class="country">Germany</span> was in the war and <span class="country">Germany</span> was considered a <span class="region">war zone</span>, there was the possibility of air raids and so on, so anyway, the <span class="building">school</span> didn't reopen. </sentence><sentence id="636">And then at that point, I wanted to go back and do my <span class="building">high school</span> graduation so I went back to the <span class="building">high school</span> of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and graduated there in March, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="637">There's a big difference between a <span class="building">high school</span> graduation in <span class="country">Germany</span>, or I think in any <span class="country">European country</span>, and also <span class="country">England</span>, and that in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="638">In <span class="country">America</span>, it is simply sort of an automatic thing, after completing 12 years, 12th grade of <span class="building">school</span> you graduate. </sentence><sentence id="639">They had a rigorous examination, I still remember it was a fearful thing and I studied day and night and, I mean, passed it of course, but it was, it ranks in my memory together with my Ph.D. prelims, I mean each one at their own level. </sentence><sentence id="640">Also, it's a state administered exam, so they, from the <span class="building">state education authority</span>, a sort of high official appeared there. </sentence><sentence id="641">Yeah, and the way the graduation sort of examination goes, was the following. </sentence><sentence id="642">There was first  3 a set of written examinations, each three hours long, one was a German composition, which incidentally, we had several essay topics to choose from. </sentence><sentence id="643">And the topic I chose was the discussion and evaluation of the work of a leading personality of modern times, and I chose Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="644">And later on my father chided me for it and said, since that will be read by a German examination commission that was a mistake that I did that, it might harm me and I said, well, the people know who Iam, I am a Jew and they know that, that's a Jewish <span class="building">school</span>, so anyway, my father was always very concerned with such things. </sentence><sentence id="645">And actually, I got a very good grade for that. </sentence><sentence id="646">And mathematics and so on and that takes place over a period of about a month, these various exams, spaced. </sentence><sentence id="647">And then after that, about I think, after the last exam, maybe two or three weeks, comes the oral. </sentence><sentence id="648">And the German examiners, I mean, they get all the written tests and then one of them appears for the final oral examination. </sentence><sentence id="649">And the oral examination was handled in such a way that the examination commission which consisted of all the teachers that we had in 12th grade, the school principal and the German official were sitting in the <span class="interior space">examination room</span> and we were called in one by one, we were 14, 13 or 14, I forgot, I think 13, we were called in. </sentence><sentence id="650">And before that started, we were all called in together and the German official made a little speech and he was a tall good-looking guy, with a white thick mane of hair, and such a huge swastika party member button here. </sentence><sentence id="651">And, which didn't particular make us, or at least me, feel easy. </sentence><sentence id="652">And he, I don't know, he said a few things, but then he went on to say that he has read so far our written examinations and he wanted to make us a compliment, he said they are far above the average of what he has seen and he wanted to particularly compliment us because he is aware of the difficult circumstances under which we are living. </sentence><sentence id="653">And then  4 he dismissed us and that man was obviously, you know, he must have been a holdover from the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span>, he was old enough anyway for that, and many of these guys were pressured into joining the party or losing their job, and so they all, not all I guess, but many, compromised and joined the party, but that man obviously, to have said that, took already courage. </sentence><sentence id="654">So, anyway, that was the examination and then after that, I was, anyway very Zionist inclined, so I volunteered for one of the <span class="populated place">preparatory camps</span> for emigration to <span class="country">Israel</span>, or <span class="country">Palestine</span> in those days. </sentence><sentence id="655">And there was, they were named by the Hebrew name Hachsharah means preparation. </sentence><sentence id="656">And, but I discovered that I was totally unsuited for communal living, I felt totally unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="657">I mean, the living there was sort of to simulate kibbutz style living, you know, and I was constantly homesick and didn't like it at all. </sentence><sentence id="658">And then for me, fortunately actually, that <span class="populated place">camp</span> was dissolved for some reason and people were distributed partly to other <span class="populated place">camps</span> and partly to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> in a suburb of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and that's where I was put and that was in a southern suburb of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and we were just a small group of boys, there wasn't more than 10, detailed to work in a <span class="env feature">forest</span> which was managed by a forestry official to cut down certain <span class="env feature">trees</span> that were diseased. </sentence><sentence id="659">And I still remember that must have been the healthiest time of my life. </sentence><sentence id="660">It was by that time, midsummer of 1940, and we were working all bare-chested, just some shorts on and sawing down, that was in the days before chain saws and all that, I mean it was really hand sawing, these long band saws where one man grabs the handle at one end and the other on the other and you go back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="661">And then after the <span class="env feature">tree</span> has been felled, then with an ax all the branches had to be cut, apparently they were diseased, but still could be used for some purpose, because we had to hack off with axes all of the branches and then with a special peeler, peel the bark off so that just the bare <span class="spatial object">trunk</span> remained. </sentence><sentence id="662">And  5 the local forester was sort of a fairly decent guy, I mean he got us as Jews, oh yeah, I should have said that with the outbreak of World War II, of course, immediately food was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="663">And not only food, also clothing, everything, shoes, everything you can think of, all consumer goods were rationed. </sentence><sentence id="664">And Jews from the beginning, got less than the, the ration system was a three tiered system, the lowest was called the general consumer and then a higher, the next step up was workers cards, these are for like factory workers, they got certain items more like I think fat, milk, maybe meat, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="665">And then the highest category was heavy labor, these were people like construction, miners, you know, in the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span>, this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="666">But, first of all, Jews were not entitled to any worker's cards even if they did do some work where Germans would have received them. </sentence><sentence id="667">And then our rations were actually shortened even compared to the general consumer. </sentence><sentence id="668">But the forester there, since he wanted also to get work out of us and he knew you know hungry people are not as strong, so he got actually through the local Nazi "Bauern" or farmer leader, peasant leader, whatever, extra rations for us of farmers bread and sausages which were actually delicious. </sentence><sentence id="669">And we were sort of a really nice little <span class="populated place">community</span> there and I spent the summer there and occasionally we had furloughs where I could go into the <span class="populated place">city</span> to visit my parents and so that was over, | think, in the fall of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="670">And then my parents still hoping that maybe something will come of the emigration attempts, my parents did all kinds of things that I never really was aware of fully. </sentence><sentence id="671">And there was, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, a <span class="building">mechanics school</span> from <span class="populated place">ORT</span>, <span class="populated place">O-R-T</span>, you know that exists still today in many <span class="country">countries</span>, and they had a <span class="building">school</span> sort of for mechanics and machine working and so I started there sometime in the fall of 1940, and by that time, however, already the Germans started to draft Jews into <span class="building">factories</span>, namely to replace  6 German workers who had been drafted into the Army, to the <span class="dlf">Wermacht</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">But, my parents were lucky, they somehow they were able to produce doctor's certificates so to exempt them from the "Arbeitseinsatz", that means forced labor, basically. </sentence><sentence id="673">And I was exempted because I worked in that <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Ijust want to ask you a couple of questions here. </sentence><sentence id="719">What was your sister doing throughout all of this, was she just at <span class="building">home</span> with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="722">A: No, yeah, actually, it must have been telepathy, I just thought of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="723">She went, first of all, when she went to <span class="building">school</span>, initially she started in the <span class="building">German public school</span>, but was then transferred by my parents to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, but a much less religious <span class="building">Jewish private school</span> and when all of these <span class="building">schools</span> were dissolved in early "39, just like the <span class="building">school</span> I was in, she was transferred to another <span class="building">school</span>, a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="724">And then there she was until, but that came later, I think in "41, all schooling for Jewish children was simply outlawed by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="725">But until then, she went to <span class="building">school</span> and had her friends, in fact, she had already a little boy friend. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: Your sister was a little bit younger, so at that point when <span class="building">schools</span> were outlawed, were there underground <span class="building">schools</span> or people just stopped going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="732">A: When schooling was forbidden, no I think first of all, she was sent also to the <span class="country">country</span> for, there was, some young Jewish kids were sent to help in harvesting, you know, things in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="733">And then when she came back from there, the deportations were already going strong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: And your parents, were they supportive of your going to these little <span class="populated place">Zionist camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="739">They were supportive, but that time they wanted to get me out, in fact, we already applied for a passport and, in fact, that is one also incident I remember where we  7 went, the <span class="building">passport office</span> was actually part of the <span class="building">Jewish emigration office</span>, which was headed by Adolf Eichmann, and we applied there for a passport for me and for someone here to come along, probably because I was a minor or something. </sentence><sentence id="740">And while we were standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, I mean you went sort of from one position to the next filling out forms and answering questions or whatever, while we were standing in line two very tall and very good looking SS officers sort of walked across the waiting <span class="interior space">room</span> where people are standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, and for some reason, one of them just got pulled to my father for some reason, and walked towards him and asked him why we were waiting there and my father answered that this is my son and he is preparing to emigrate to <span class="country">Palestine</span> and then he said, oh, and then he answered, he asked my father, is he going with the <span class="spatial object">Hechalutz</span>? </sentence><sentence id="741">And sort of in perfect Hebrew, and my father said, yes and then he just turned around and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="742">And I don't, my father didn't seem nervous and so on, but I'm sure he must have been extremely, you know, that guy was, he looked very aggressive and I mean like the image of an SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="743">Anyway, so in fact, that passport I still have, part of my cherished memories, with a big J which after the war I found out, we actually owe the Swiss more than the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="744">Did you ever read about that? </sentence><sentence id="745">That the Swiss pressured the Germans to put the J because <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Switzerland</span> had a treaty for tourist visas, not to need visas for tourism, but that apparently Jews discovered and went there as tourists with their German passports, but then didn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="746">And the Swiss didn't like that and so they told the Germans to do something, put a J in or whatever so that they can immediately recognize the passport of a Jew and then they can refuse them. </sentence><sentence id="747">These nice, neutral Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="748">Yeah, anyway, coming back, where was I? </sentence><sentence id="749">Oh, yeah, I went to <span class="building">ORT</span> to learn mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="750">And actually that turned out to be one of the more useful things I  8 learned in my life, probably more useful than Latin or, I don't know, but anyway, I learned how to operate a <span class="spatial object">lathe</span>, although that I have never done later, and operate various tools. </sentence><sentence id="751">And, as I said, at that time also they started to draft Jews, and on April 30, 1941, also, oh no, I'm sorry, I have to back up there. </sentence><sentence id="752">I want to say that in February of 1941, we received a notice that we have to vacate the huge <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that we still occupied on the <span class="building">Kaiserdamm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="753">That was one of the major <span class="dlf">boulevards</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, within a few days. </sentence><sentence id="754">That was an action that was actually originated by Albert Speer who was a German armaments minister and also in charge of construction in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and he always tried after the war to sort of pretend that he was just a professional and did his thing for the armaments, but had nothing to do whatsoever with persecution of Jews or other minorities. </sentence><sentence id="755">Which is a big lie, I mean that was one of the things which he did, to kick Jews out of their <span class="interior space">apartments</span> and Jews who were kicked out in this way, had to move in then, were restricted to move into so called <span class="building">Jew houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">These were <span class="building">apartment buildings</span> where at least 50% of the tenants were already Jews and then also, you couldn't by any means, of course, displace a German family in such a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">But you had to move into sort of a sublet, into an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> already inhabited by another Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="758">And that was a big blow, that was a huge, we had a huge <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, of course, I never had mentioned that so far. </sentence><sentence id="759">But it was an eight room <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and there were many art pieces in there that my parents had collected, of course, in better times, many oriental rugs and I did mention the big <span class="building">library</span> that my father had. </sentence><sentence id="760">And so, I mean just to, and of course, if I think today for example, if we had to move out of our <span class="building">house</span>, which I think in square footage may be smaller than that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, that would be a nightmare within a few days. </sentence><sentence id="761">You know, you accumulate so many things, personal things, documents, whatever, pictures, and but  9 in addition to that, a new <span class="interior space">apartment</span> had to be found, a new <span class="interior space">room</span> or <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in another <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="762">Anyway, to make a long story short, we thought we had an ideal solution, moving into the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of an uncle of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="763">Now, he was, the man was the brother of my maternal grandfather and his wife and it was a much smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and they were living there and they had a son in the mid or late 30's and then two single women were already living there also who had been kicked out somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="764">End of side one of tape two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim, March 12, 1997, tape two, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Of course, we were not the only family living under such circumstances, it was throughout the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> that Jews were cramped together. </sentence><sentence id="795">That, I guess, was the equivalent of a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> it would have been impossible for the Nazis to sort of institute a real <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in an <span class="region">area</span> where only Jews lived because Jews never were concentrated in one <span class="region">area</span> to such an extent, so they would have had basically to clear some <span class="region">area</span> of non-Jewish Germans and anyway that would have been too disruptive. </sentence><sentence id="796">So, instead, they crammed then the remaining Jews at that time simply into a much smaller number of <span class="building">apartment buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="797">That immediately led to innumerable conflicts. </sentence><sentence id="798">First of all, I think I indicated before, that food was rationed and so it was very important for each family to keep its food supply identified and separate and there were frequent suspicions and some even, sometimes even accusations that somebody else ate somebody else's sausage or at least part of it or that something was missing that should have not been missing. </sentence><sentence id="799">And, in fact, the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> became known throughout the <span class="populated place">community</span> as the <span class="dlf">battlefield</span> of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="800">Because it wasn't just the problem of keeping the food supplies separate, then there was a problem even of preparing dinner for example. </sentence><sentence id="801"> 0 Usually people eat more or less at the same time and they don't eat dinner at four when nobody needed the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="802">And so there was a source of friction in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="803">And of course, with clean up and this was particularly, these things all might seem to be petty, but at that time, the nerves of all or most Jews at least, were so frayed already by years of oppression and innumerable Nazi anti-Jewish measures, that it never took much for people to fly into a rage and to, that was really actually a very tragic outcome of that, but that's what happened in many families, it happened in ours. </sentence><sentence id="804">The fact that we lived with relatives had absolutely nothing to do with it and I think my mother and her aunt became fierce enemies while we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="805">I would like just to back up briefly to a somewhat earlier time when we were still in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, in the big <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on the <span class="dlf">Kaiserdamm Boulevard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">When I mentioned that after the outbreak of the war, the <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> were taken away from Jews, a few days after that measure was instituted, our <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> rang and when we opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, the man who lived in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> upstairs above us was at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, he was a wealthy bachelor, middle aged, I have no idea, but the way I remember him, he was probably then around 50, and he asked to talk to my father in private under four eyes. </sentence><sentence id="807">So my father and he went into my father's <span class="interior space">study</span>, and they spent some time there, and we were all puzzled because there had never been really any social or any other contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="808">And then after, I don't know, some minutes he re-emerged, and they were both, both gentlemen were chatting sort of pleasantly, and our upstairs neighbor said goodbye and left. </sentence><sentence id="809">And my father then turned to us with total surprise on his face, saying that Mr. Kopf, that was his name, just offered that we could use his <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, he just heard that our <span class="spatial object">phone</span> was taken away and he felt that was terrible, and if we had the need to call somebody, we should feel free and not only that,  1 but he even gave us permission to pass his number on to a few, but absolutely reliable, people who may have a need to call us, in that case he would send his maid down and someone could come up and answer the call. </sentence><sentence id="810">And that was, in those days and under those circumstances, was extraordinary because the man surely risked, particularly in the second part of the offer. </sentence><sentence id="811">So there were sometimes such cases also. </sentence><sentence id="812">Another thing that I wanted to mention is that in the same <span class="building">building</span>, on the first <span class="interior space">floor</span>, the Ambassador of a small <span class="region">Central American country</span> was living. </sentence><sentence id="813">I'm not 100% certain any more, but I'm fairly sure that it was <span class="country">Costa Rica</span>, I can't swear it, anyway, my parents when the situation became worse and worse, particularly after Kristallnacht, my parents decided maybe an approach to that man might be helpful in opening some <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and although we barely knew him except you know when we crossed paths on the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> or so on, my father made an appointment and went to see him and all I know is that nothing ever came of it. </sentence><sentence id="814">Okay, back now to February, 1941, after our eviction from the big <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and our move into that much smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="815">That, yeah, that was in February of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="816">Two months later, in April, precisely on April 30, 1941, the <span class="building">apprentice workshop</span> of <span class="building">ORT</span>, where I was apprenticing for sort of mechanic and machine shop work, was ordered closed by the Gestapo, and all students in there were supposed to report to the labor <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">The Nazis, incidentally, had instituted a special <span class="building">labor office</span> for Jews shortly after the outbreak of the war, whose task it was to deal with Jews exclusively and to give them, give Jews jobs mainly in the <span class="building">defense industry</span> or also in other sort of generally considered unpleasant work, like for example, the <span class="populated place">city</span> <span class="building">garbage department</span>, <span class="spatial object">garbage pickup</span> and similar things, and also they ride the <span class="dlf">railroads</span>, certain unpleasant jobs in connection with the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> on <span class="dlf">tracks</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="818">Many Jews had already been drafted to work, my parents succeeded  2 in getting exemptions by doctors, by getting certificates from doctors, I mean neither one of them really was very healthy by that time any more. </sentence><sentence id="819">And, now for our advantage was, I mean our, meaning the students, the apprentices at the <span class="building">ORT school</span>, that we were considered to be sort of already trained mechanics and, therefore, could get some better jobs and all of us wound up at one of the Siemens <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="820">Now before the war, the central <span class="building">Siemens factory</span> was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, although they did have <span class="building">factories</span> in other parts of <span class="country">Germany</span>, but in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was the <span class="building">central factory</span>, and also the <span class="building">central administration building</span> of Siemens was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and it was a huge complex, it took, it was many square miles large, fenced in of course, many, many <span class="building">buildings</span> manufacturing all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="821">In general, <span class="building">Siemens</span> is an electrical equipment manufacturer along the same <span class="dlf">lines</span> as <span class="building">General Electric</span> maybe, at least used to be, before they started building such things as <span class="spatial object">jet engines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="822">Of course, they were entirely into war production at that time and one day after our, after the <span class="building">ORT school</span> was dismissed, we already, we had to report to this <span class="building">labor office</span> and there we were given, you know, pieces of paper telling us where to report the next day and at what time and so on and so that's how I wound up at <span class="building">Siemens</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q: Did you have any choice in this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: None whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="855">In fact, the <span class="building">labor office</span> also was run strictly along <span class="dlf">Nazi lines</span>, I mean we were treated very badly there, I mean with words, nobody was beaten there, but just sort of insulted and we were just told where to work. </sentence><sentence id="856">Some others who were there, by the way, were told to work also, were sent to other <span class="building">factories</span>, but I happened to wind up at <span class="building">Siemens</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="860">Q: Did you feel a bit safer because they needed your output? </sentence><sentence id="861"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="862">A: At that time, the deportations hadn't started yet, so actually I felt, for two reasons, I mean to put it mildly, disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="863">I mean one was that I had just been about, I don't know, seven or eight months at the <span class="building">ORT school</span> and was just sort of getting into it learning all kinds of aspects of the trade, of being a mechanic, and that would be interrupted now. </sentence><sentence id="864">And the second thing, of course, that I knew I would be working for the German war production which didn't really make me obviously happy. </sentence><sentence id="865">At <span class="building">Siemens</span>, the Jews who worked there, and I think that is true of all other <span class="building">defense plants</span> also, did not work sort of scattered around throughout the <span class="building">factory</span> here, maybe one <span class="spatial object">machine</span> operated by a Jew and next to him by a German worker. </sentence><sentence id="866">Instead, the Jews were all in one particular department where all workers were Jews except for the foreman, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="872">And in this way we also could be easier controlled. </sentence><sentence id="873">Number two, we were not permitted to walk through the <span class="dlf">factory area</span> unescorted. </sentence><sentence id="874">Now, that meant the shift started at 6:00 a.m. and it was already quite a walk from the <span class="dlf">factory gate</span> to the <span class="building">building</span> where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="875">So we had to be at the <span class="dlf">gate</span> at 5:45 to be picked up by a guard which then led us to our <span class="building">department</span> where we then punched in, we had to punch in before 6:00. </sentence><sentence id="876">If somebody missed that guarded walk from the <span class="dlf">gate</span> to the <span class="building">department</span>, then a separate guard had to be sent and the foreman made a point of waiting after 6:00 and the person had no way to get to the <span class="building">department</span> and then he would send somebody down, the person then would come and, of course, punch in after 6:00 and there was a rule that every late appearance has to be reported to the Gestapo and so that was a very powerful incentive to be on time. </sentence><sentence id="877">Even at that time, at which deportations hadn't started yet, because nobody wanted to get entangled with the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="878">Furthermore, since we were not permitted to walk through the <span class="building">factory</span> alone, that also meant that there was no way how we could walk  4 to the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> or <span class="interior space">restrooms</span> whenever the individual need arose for a person. </sentence><sentence id="879">Instead, twice a day, we were also under guard, conducted to the <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">One was at 9:00 and the second time after the lunch hour, around 1:00 or between 1:00 and 2:00. </sentence><sentence id="881">That meant if somebody, for example, needed to go in between, that person had to report to the foreman and depending on the foreman's mood at that particular instant, he could either tell the person, well, you just have to wait, sorry, until the group goes, or he could give him a dressing down and say, well, okay, I will detail somebody to take you down there. </sentence><sentence id="882">At this point, by the way, all the workers, or the Jewish workers were men. </sentence><sentence id="883">Later on I will mention that we also had many Jewish women and, of course, that was particularly humiliating in that case if a woman had to go to that male foreman and tell him that she has to go to the <span class="interior space">restroom</span> and then for him possibly to sneer and to detail somebody to take her down to the <span class="interior space">ladies room</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="896">Q: What was the actual work you were doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="898">A: We built a part of electric motors called <span class="spatial object">commutators</span>. </sentence><sentence id="899">We didn't know what they were used for, there was a rumor these were motors which were built into <span class="spatial object">submarines</span>, you know, for their electrical supply, but that whether that was true or not, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="900">Anyway, these commutators present an essential part of an electric motor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="904">Q: Were there any attempts to your knowledge, to sabotage in subtle ways, the production? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: To my knowledge not, I gave it a brief thought and rejected it outright because while being there, of course, I also acquainted myself with the system, they had a very thorough and sophisticated quality control system whereby any part that was produced before it left the <span class="building">factory</span>, went to a <span class="spatial object">controller</span>, somebody who checked it out electrically and so on, that  5 would have been, anything that I would have done to, you know, sort of make it misfunction, would have been discovered by that person. </sentence><sentence id="907">So, first of all, it wouldn't have achieved anything because it would have never gone to a place where it could have done damage and secondly, as far as I remember they could trace who made it. </sentence><sentence id="908">So I would have wound up in some horrible way without even achieving any purpose in doing so. </sentence><sentence id="909">Yeah, I mean, the atmosphere, there were still a few German workers in that <span class="populated place">Jewish department</span>, actually, some even women, they had started to use women in <span class="building">factories</span>, which used to be also unheard of in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but simply because of the labor shortage after the war broke out, since you know most of the able bodied males, of course, served in the Wehrmacht, in the army. </sentence><sentence id="910">And also, German workers, some actually were quite nice, I have to say, and some others were very hostile, so it varied from person to person. </sentence><sentence id="911">In the, as I said before, that happened on the 30th of April, 1941, and in the summer of 1941, there was rumor running around, we are going to get Jewish women. </sentence><sentence id="912">So, obviously, there was big excitement, notwithstanding the fact that for these women it probably was not so much of a pleasure, but at least we looked forward to some positive diversions. </sentence><sentence id="913">And the rumor turned out to be true and so later on that day, I think in the afternoon, a whole group of girls and women led again by a guard, of course, came in. </sentence><sentence id="914">One of them particularly caught my eye immediately, she was in appearance exactly what I had always looked for sort of in a woman as far as appearance is concerned, sort of dark brown, close to black hair, and brown eyes, curls and looking in general, a very pleasant facial expression and sort of a very Semitic expression in her face, which I always enjoyed in a woman and still do, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="915">And it turned out, so I sort of concentrated my attentions the first few days on her, I found out that her first name was Margot and I also  6 found out that she had a steady boyfriend, which didn't surprise me. </sentence><sentence id="916">So this immediately cooled my interest, as least for the time being. </sentence><sentence id="917">We worked then together, I mean, we were usually interspersed, there may have been a woman here and a male here and so on, several males and so on, and among ourselves a real camaraderie developed, the chief foreman was a man, his name was, I'll never forget, Alexander Siegel, and this, he was about in his, retrospectively guessing, in his late 30's, I would say, possibly 40, and sort of a real rough neck, extremely nice to all females, who also after the war really didn't find much reason to complain about him. </sentence><sentence id="918">And very gruff to males, and myself, I again started to rub him the wrong way and me the wrong way, so I was sort of on his list to bark at whenever he found a pretext for doing that. </sentence><sentence id="919">Yeah, I also met, that is very important, a male, in fact that was already on the first day that I started to work there, a male, I mean a man a few years older than I, his name was Hans Fabisch and we became really extremely close friends, it was my first close friend since I lost the one whom I had in <span class="building">high school</span>, who emigrated to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="920">And we really went through thick and thin, we were, we became close personal confidants, we shared our recreational hours and did a lot together and talked a lot and he was probably one of two or three best friends that I ever had. </sentence><sentence id="921">He was, as I said, a few years older than I and he had decided to study medicine and was already, he had all kinds of medical books at <span class="building">home</span> and had started to sort of self-educate himself in anatomy and other similar medical subjects. </sentence><sentence id="922">Oh yeah, that reminds me of something else. </sentence><sentence id="923">Since we graduated from <span class="building">high school</span>, there was really no <span class="building">educational outlet</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="924"><span class="building">Universities</span>, of course, we were prohibited from enrolling in or even attending classes, and there was really nothing else except, you know, my apprenticeship to become a mechanic. </sentence><sentence id="925">So, with a group of other friends and also  7 particularly former classmates from my <span class="building">high school</span> graduating class, we developed sort of a set of informal talks which were held in different <span class="interior space">apartments</span> of us sort of moving around. </sentence><sentence id="926">At that time I didn't use that word, but later on it occurred to me it was almost like an <span class="building">underground university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="927">First of all, our German teacher, who was actually a very highly educated man and also in philosophy, he taught us sort of a course in philosophy and it was partly that he talked and partly it was done already in seminar style, where he would assign certain topics to one of us and that person had to report back at the next time and give a little talk on that. </sentence><sentence id="928">And this Hans Fabisch, whom I just mentioned, he had connections to various medical doctors and we got talks from, I don't know, various medical subjects, you know, of general interest and so on and then somebody else, I forgot who that was, knew an architect, a Jewish architect, these were all of course Jews who talked and they were also happy because they were thrown out of their professions and had nothing to do, particularly this former German teacher whose name, incidentally, was Kurt Levinstein, he, the others sort of rotated, but he consistently, week after week, he never took a penny and he taught with extreme enthusiasm, which sort of was infectious even. </sentence><sentence id="929">And that was a tremendous sort of intellectual outlet for us which otherwise we had really no outlet for. </sentence><sentence id="930">Another person that I would like to mention is a girl who was a few years older than I, I think about four years, her name was Ruth Perl, and she was part of that <span class="dlf">circle</span> that also went to <span class="building">classes</span> and she sort of became somewhat close to my friend, Hans Fabisch and myself. </sentence><sentence id="931">And as time went on, I think closer to myself, and we sort of started to strike up a friendship and we occasionally went to <span class="spatial object">movies</span> together and it sort of developed that we became quite close and she was my first girlfriend and we shared a lot of both personal thoughts, general thoughts and everything,  8 also entertainment and so on. </sentence><sentence id="932">Oh, yeah, an important factor by the way, also, was music. </sentence><sentence id="933">All of us in that <span class="dlf">circle</span> and in various other <span class="dlf">circles</span> were lovers of classical music and that went also for Ruth, and it was in wartime, practically impossible to buy records. </sentence><sentence id="934">So people in private <span class="interior space">apartments</span>, I mean also many non-Jews, sort of started business swapping, used records that is, and so I enriched my collection by, and by the way not just swapping, but also selling, so I bought quite a number of records in those days that I didn't have before. </sentence><sentence id="935">It should be remembered, of course, that the quality and the kind of <span class="spatial object">phonograph</span> was a totally different world from what we have today. </sentence><sentence id="936">I mean, there was obviously no high-fi, there was obviously, there was only one speaker out of an inferior <span class="spatial object">phonograph</span>, and the <span class="spatial object">phonograph</span> was sometimes even hand driven by winding it up, and if it was electric, then it was kept illegally by the way, because it should have been turned in. </sentence><sentence id="937">But we managed to have sort of house concerts, also periodically, where we actually made up a program like for a philharmonic concert, say some Beethoven symphony and maybe a piano concerto by somebody else and different people would then bring those records and then we would all assemble in somebody's <span class="interior space">living room</span> and listen to it just the way one would have gone to a philharmonic concert, which of course, was also forbidden for Jews to go to. </sentence><sentence id="938">A drastic change in the situation of the Jews occurred with the introduction of the yellow Star of David as of September 19, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="939">The law was very specific that every Jew as defined by the Nuremberg laws has to wear such a yellow star on his outer clothing whenever the person is in public, and it specified even exactly where it had to be worn, on the left hand side at about the level of the <span class="dlf">heart</span> and also it couldn't be tagged on by pins or safety pins, but had to be firmly sewn on, and this way they wanted to avoid that people might put on a star and then later on take it off again and  9 the Gestapo was known to walk up to Jews with a <span class="env feature">star</span> and sort of try it with their hand, with their fingers to get under it to see whether there is a <span class="interior space">space</span> between the <span class="env feature">star</span> and the <span class="spatial object">garment</span> to make sure that it was firmly sewn on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="974">Q: They did this to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: No, not to me, but they have done it to people. </sentence><sentence id="977">That made it finally impossible to, or almost impossible I should say, for Jews to go to all the entertainments and cultural offerings that were forbidden after Kristallnacht three years earlier. </sentence><sentence id="978">My friend Hans Fabisch and I devised, actually it was his original idea, a method even to get around that. </sentence><sentence id="979">And it was based on the following, that in those days double breasted suits and coats were fashionable and if you had, if you buttoned it the way, I mean men buttoned their suit jackets then the left side where the star was on was, of course, on the outside and visible, but if you changed the buttoning, and most were also sewn in such a way that there were <span class="dlf">button holes</span> and buttons, you could button it either way, and the way say women usually button them with the right part over the left, then the star would be automatically covered up. </sentence><sentence id="980">That, it was important to have it that way because upon leaving one's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and also walking in one's own <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, it would have been much too dangerous to walk around without a star because people know you and you would have been immediately reported to the Gestapo, so what we did is we left our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> as good Jews with our yellow stars, walked many <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, maybe 10, to an <span class="region">area</span> where nobody knew us, then ducked into an <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of some <span class="building">apartment building</span> and quickly changed the buttoning of our jacket or coat and reappeared as Aryan Germans and then we could go to a movie or anything without detection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="986">Q: Weren't you a little bit afraid of doing this? </sentence><sentence id="987"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="988">A: No, in fact, it sort of actually got me excited, like getting my adrenalin flowing that I was doing something like that. </sentence><sentence id="989">My father, I should say, was horrified and forbade me strictly to do that because not only did I endanger myself, very often the Gestapo would then also arrest the rest of the family, but I just didn't want to listen to any advice of caution and also I couldn't stand being so cooped up. </sentence><sentence id="990">I should make a reference, incidentally, in connection with culture and movies. </sentence><sentence id="991">There existed a Jewish Kulturbund, or culture society, that actually existed already since long before the Kristallnacht, namely since the time when Jewish artists were summarily thrown out from all <span class="building">German theaters</span> and <span class="building">movie production companies</span>, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="992">And it was founded originally, of course, to give Jewish musicians, actors, etcetera, a way of earning a living in their craft. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="998">And it was always fairly well visited, I remember in the summer of 1939, I saw an excellent performance of a Kalman operetta (Kalman was a Hungarian operetta composer) Grafin Mariza, Countess Mariza, which was staged by the <span class="building">Kulturbund</span> very professionally and I enjoyed it very much. </sentence><sentence id="999">I have seen other things, too, but of course, and then after Jews were prohibited from going to other general cultural events and entertainment etcetera, then, of course, the <span class="building">Kulturbund</span> became, in addition to providing an outlet for fired Jewish artists, became also the only legal way at least, for the Jewish population at large even to see a movie or a play or symphony. </sentence><sentence id="1000">They had a very nice symphony orchestra, by the way, all consisting of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1001">But anyway, I considered it simply a challenge to do something that I was prohibited from doing by the government. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And so, we did that and my girlfriend, Ruth, went one day to a <span class="building">beauty parlor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Even <span class="building">beauty parlors</span> were forbidden for Jews, so of course, she didn't wear a Jewish star and along the way she was stopped by a policeman, it was a regular policeman in uniform,  1 and asked for her ID and when he saw that she was Jewish, he, the way she told it to me, was evidently embarrassed and told her in an apologizing way that unfortunately, he is forced by law to report that to the Gestapo, any transgression by a Jew had to be reported to the Gestapo and he had no way to avoid that. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And so we were terribly scared, and then for weeks we didn't hear anything and so our scare sort of slowly subsided, although I told her that if they really get after her, that she should simply go <span class="interior space">underground</span> and then she told me she will definitely not do that because she has no way to sustain herself and doesn't know anyone where to go to, so anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1005">On one day, in fact, on the 9th of September, 1941, the 9th of September or the 9th of October, doesn't make a difference anyway, she, we always met in the morning on the way to the <span class="building">factory</span>, my <span class="spatial object">train</span> actually, I had to change <span class="spatial object">trains</span> at a certain <span class="building">station</span> and she, and join another <span class="spatial object">train</span> where she already was sitting in and she always sat in the same <span class="spatial object">car</span> so from there on, we always rode together. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And on that morning, when I came into the <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span> where she was sitting in, I took one look and knew what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Her eyes were totally red from both probably having cried and having been sleepless, and she pulled, without saying a word, a letter from the, from her <span class="spatial object">pocketbook</span> and which had the dreaded head Geheime Staatspolizei, the complete word for Gestapo, which is just an abbreviation. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And it asked her to appear on that morning at 9:00 in the <span class="building">offices</span>, <span class="interior space">room</span> such and such, with, that's all, just to appear for an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But everybody knew what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And she, now I haven't really talked about the deportations, but the deportations had started a month earlier and Jews working in <span class="building">defense plants</span> were understood to be exempted from deportations, so she had come to work mainly to show our foreman, Alexander Siegel, the summons to see what he could do for her. </sentence><sentence id="1011">But he coldly told her that there was  2 nothing that he could do for her because the Gestapo does have the complete lists of all Jews employed by Siemens, and they know also of the agreement that Jews working in <span class="building">defense plants</span> are to be deferred, however, they can do what they want and there is nothing more that he can do. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And then we talked a little bit, the atmosphere was so unbelievably stifling that I almost felt like somebody choked my throat, and then she said goodbye to our mutual friend Hans Fabisch and to me and just walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1013">It was the last time I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And, yeah, back up briefly, in September, just about a month before the 7th, the first <span class="spatial object">deportation train</span> left for the <span class="region">East</span> and it was characteristic, it was characteristic of all <span class="spatial object">transports</span> to the <span class="region">East</span>, nobody knew where these

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1032">Q: Who was deported, what kinds of groups or categories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1034">A: I don't think it was any particular category with the exception that those working in <span class="building">defense plants</span> were exempted, but otherwise, they just, I don't even know, I think the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> was enlisted in putting together lists for deportation. . . </sentence><sentence id="1035">End of <span class="dlf">side tape</span> two. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: This is an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 12, 1997. </sentence><sentence id="1041">The interviewer is Randy Goldman, this is tape three, side A. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: The deportations, the mechanisms of the deportation was handled, of course, by the Gestapo at the command level, but it was carried out under order of the Gestapo by the Jewish community organizations. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And they put together the lists of Jews to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Sometimes the Gestapo would make particular demands, for example, at one time the Gestapo was afraid that Jews who lived along the elevated <span class="dlf">train tracks</span> might give  3 flashlight signals to Allied bombers and thus directing them to bomb the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, which on its face was ludicrous because they would have then also directed the bombs to themselves living right next to the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But anyway, be that as it may, the Gestapo ordered the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to provide such a list and get these people on the <span class="spatial object">deportation trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1048">But in general, that was one exception, the <span class="populated place">community</span> picked the people, that was initially a process where people were notified sometime ahead of time by a letter which only said that their <span class="interior space">apartment</span> has been designated to be cleared. </sentence><sentence id="1049">It was sort of as if that was all there was to it, that the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was to be cleared. </sentence><sentence id="1050">But everybody knew what it meant, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And with a set of detailed questionnaires where all the assets had to be filled in and so on and then another questionnaire where all the contents of the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>, there were detailed instructions how much <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> in terms of size and weight could be taken along, which items should be taken along and which could not be taken along. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Among those not to be taken along, for example, were negotiable, anything negotiable value, securities, money, cash, jewelry and it had to be filled out exactly what the contents of the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> was that was to be taken along. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Now the result of that was that there was a wave of suicides. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Many people who were too scared to go through the deportations since nobody knew what really happened to these people and so after awhile the Gestapo discontinued that and then went over to assist them, where people were just being picked up without any prior notification. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And anyway, they had to be kept in a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> before being shipped out because the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> that were used for deporting Jews, such a <span class="spatial object">train</span> was holding upward of six, seven hundred people, even up to a thousand and eleven hundred. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And it took more than a day or two to pick up that many people, so they were housed in a <span class="populated place">transit  4 camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1057">At first the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, in fact, was one of the <span class="building">synagogues</span> until the military, yeah, that <span class="building">synagogue</span>, by the way, had been only lightly damaged during Kristallnacht and had been repaired afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So that was first used for a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and then the military sort of made a demand to have that <span class="building">synagogue</span> for, I think, <span class="spatial object">storage</span> of some sort or other. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And then it was shifted to an <span class="building">old age home</span> of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and Jews were collected there until they had enough people in there to fill a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, then they were taken away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: During this process, were you very aware of what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: Yeah, at that point, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And in fact, this group of people that I mentioned who were also having various lectures and so on, we, at that point, we decided that we have to somehow do something, at least, first of all, to find out what is happening because people were being picked up and then never heard from again. </sentence><sentence id="1080">Now, that in itself has a tremendously terrorizing effect, somebody, your neighbor or maybe even your brother or somebody close to you whom you still saw yesterday, today he was gone, or she. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And not only was that person gone, but I mean except for the fact that you knew they were transported <span class="region">East</span>, otherwise you had no inkling. </sentence><sentence id="1082">There was never a letter or postcard coming back, there was never any sign of life even, so that in itself had a terrorizing effect, so but we were all very, very naive about the whole process. </sentence><sentence id="1083">We sat down and had a big sort of session where we threw out all kinds of ideas then we came away with a great idea that whoever of the group is the first one to be deported, then has to see somehow after getting to the <span class="region">East</span>, to contact maybe German soldiers or somebody who can get a message back to one of us describing what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1084">In the light of how the deportations were handled, that was just unbelievably naive and, of course, the first  5 one of our group, there was a girl, I still remember her, and of course, she vanished exactly like everybody else and nothing was ever heard from her. </sentence><sentence id="1085">She obviously had no chance to contact anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1086">I mean, Jews who were deported were immediately, of course, that was not really known at that time, but they were immediately put into either <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> or <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And in <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>, many were immediately on the spot gassed and that who were not gassed were kept in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> for hard labor and had no way to communicate with anybody outside of that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1088">It was just totally impossible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1100">Q: And your family? </sentence><sentence id="1101">They were all fine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1104">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Of course, again, the thing was that my father considered himself lucky originally because he was exempted from the forced labor because of a doctor certificate, but now that labor was the only thing that exempted you from deportation, that turned out to be not so lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1106">He went through several stages of such real ironies. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Now, of course, he would not have been in a position really to do <span class="building">factory</span> work, however, he, now he knew one of the personalities at the central, at the <span class="building">congregation offices</span> and, in fact, it was a woman who was in charge of the sort of deportation decisions and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And she gave him an unpaid job there for the <span class="populated place">community</span>, what he did he never really talked about and he was, I mean like in all other things, very close mouthed, but I know he had some work at the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> that may have exempted him for some time. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Now, in April of "42, oh, I have to back up, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Now I remember I made a mistake when I talked about the arrest of my girlfriend, Ruth. </sentence><sentence id="1111">I know that I said it was in either September or October of "41. </sentence><sentence id="1112">It was actually "42. </sentence><sentence id="1113">In "41 the deportations had barely started and it was  6 in October of "42, or September, I don't know, that her arrest took place. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Okay, coming back, my parents were actually arrested in April of "42 and by the Gestapo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1126">Q: Now, I want to interrupt you for a second. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Because on your notes, I see that you said they were imprisoned in December of "42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1130">A: Yeah, well I'm coming to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: Oh, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: And they were taken to the <span class="dlf">collection point</span>, to that <span class="building">synagogue</span> that I referred to, but the Gestapo officers who arrested them said, oh yeah, what happened was that my father had agreed with his personal physician that he would either commit suicide or take some strong sedative which would totally knock him out and the physician prescribed to him something called Veronal. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I don't think it exists here now, at least not under this name, so I don't know what it would be here. </sentence><sentence id="1138">But, he immediately took that and was sort of like in a coma, so he was, obviously they couldn't take him along, so they put in a phone call and had the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> pick him up and then my mother and sister were taken and they told me to come along because they said it's likely if the father is not capable of being transported, that my mother and sister would be sent <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So that is also one of the weird examples where occasionally they had something that might almost sound like humane in all this murderous brutality. </sentence><sentence id="1140">At any rate, I spent several hours in that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and it was a horrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="1141">The Jews there, it was a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and the people who were to be sort of awaited their deportation, they were all at the <span class="interior space">balcony</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I mean, <span class="building">European synagogues</span> at that time, and I think still today in fact, separate the sexes, men pray <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and women in the <span class="interior space">balcony</span>, so they had all of the people for deportation in the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and you could see sort of people up wandering around absentmindedly and  7 so on, and in a daze. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And then on the <span class="interior space">ground floor</span>, which was the <span class="region">area</span> where men used to pray, that's where the Gestapo, they had their <span class="building">offices</span> and they would periodically call somebody down to fill out forms and for interrogation and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So anyway, after several hours my mother and sister were told they could go <span class="building">home</span> again and so that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And they handed me our luggage back, their luggage, and then we went back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1156">Q: Did you think that when you were in that <span class="building">synagogue</span> that you might all be leaving and that it was just a ruse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1158">A: No, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1159">It didn't occur to me. </sentence><sentence id="1160">But maybe that was just my habitual optimism, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Now as time went on, the situation became more and more unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I remember one co-worker in the <span class="building">factory</span>, from the Jews he was probably about five years older than I. He appeared one morning with a totally lost expression. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The night before when he came <span class="building">home</span> from work, he found the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> empty. </sentence><sentence id="1164">He had a wife and a little baby girl, I think, and they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I mean, he couldn't even say goodbye to them. </sentence><sentence id="1166">They were gone, and he was supposed to continue working. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And there were many similar horror stories, and they were constantly, of course, circulating and, in fact, since all Jews were also no longer permitted to buy newspapers, by the way, and as we discussed before, also had to turn in their radios, so there was a new way to sort of spread the news, and that was called sort of radio by mouth or <span class="spatial object">mouth radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And I mean the psychological situation became just unbearable, it was sort of a combination of a fear of the worst to come and being trapped into something where one has no control and mixed with a desire to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I mean, many of my friends, also my friend Hans and I and so on, we talked about going underground, but to go underground that means going into hiding with forged papers, seemed like such an enormous undertaking, I mean  8 first of all to get forged ID's and it would cost a lot of money and then food would have to be procured on the <span class="building">black market</span> and, of course, none of us had any money to speak of, so it was mainly a lot of talk. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Now some people, mainly those who were politically engaged, they were able to go <span class="interior space">underground</span> and be protected by politically like-minded people. </sentence><sentence id="1171">That was true, especially of communists. </sentence><sentence id="1172">Oh yeah, and talking about communists, there was a <span class="interior space">Jewish communist cell</span> actually centered in one of the other Jewish departments at <span class="building">Siemens</span> and headed by a man named Herbert Baum and his wife, Marianne Baum, B-A-U-M. And they had been, apparently, an <span class="interior space">underground cell</span> for years only of Jews and basically just meeting and sort of like holding seminars about Marxism and the dangers of capitalism and fascism and so on and then at some point they decided that wasn't really enough and something had to be done to fight back against the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And in the, it was also sort of the summer, I think, of 1942, in the center of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> the Nazis staged a vast exhibit under the name the Soviet Paradise and, of course, they meant it sarcastically and the exhibit was devoted to materials which they had, you know, uncovered in their process of conquering large parts of the <span class="region">western Soviet Union</span> and much of it may have been true, much of it was lies, whatever, and the exhibit was apparently quite successful, there was throngs visiting it, so they decided to burn it down. </sentence><sentence id="1174">But, of course, they were not experts at anything, I mean they were not experts in sabotage and in technical things and so on, so it was a big tragedy, they succeeded in putting in a small fire somehow, the damage was so minimal that the Germans even could keep it out of the <span class="spatial object">newspapers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1175">If it had been a major fire, they would have had no choice but to at least report it, but it wasn't even reported in the press. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And not only that, but immediately they didn't catch anybody, they sort of, they scattered certain delayed  9 incendiaries which you put somewhere and then it takes five minutes or so for the flame to break out, so they were gone by the time, so nobody was caught. </sentence><sentence id="1177">But the Gestapo had found a network of undercover agents in the underground communist movement, anyway the details I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1178">The fact is, that they got on their <span class="dlf">trail</span>, they were arrested all of them and the first thing that the Gestapo did is tell the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> that they want 500 Jewish men immediately, 250 of them will be shot on the spot and another 250 will be immediately deported to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And if any sabotage by where Jews are involved happens again, they will take 10 times as many people. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And that was a horror that immediately spread through this mouth radio, of course, and I knew some of the people involved, incidentally, because it was centered at <span class="building">Siemens</span>, and the Baums were at <span class="building">Siemens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And so that contributed to the demoralizing effect. </sentence><sentence id="1182">As a sideline, I want to say that they became great heroes in the now defunct <span class="country">German Democratic Republic</span>, formerly <span class="region">East Germany</span>, and there was a <span class="dlf">street</span> named after them and books were written and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1183">But, of course, they are all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Actually, one of the members of the group was a girl who graduated with me from that <span class="building">high school</span>, she was in my class, and in fact, I remember that after graduation, I once had a long discussion. </sentence><sentence id="1185">She was then already a communist, and she tried to convert me. </sentence><sentence id="1186">All I remember is that we had a very lively hard hitting discussion and | didn't convince her and she didn't convince me. </sentence><sentence id="1187">But it never occurred to me that she would belong to the, if she would have convinced me, who knows, maybe I would have been in that group also. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Anyway, yeah, they were all tried by the so-called <span class="building">People's Court</span>, that's the same <span class="building">court</span> that also convicted those, you know, plotters who tried to assassinate Hitler two years later in July, "44. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And of course, most of them were executed, a few got some jail sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Alright, this is basically the  0 atmosphere, now also I should say about <span class="building">Siemens</span>, coming back to that, I said already that we got no worker food ration stamps and even less than the general consumer, we got paid less than the German workers who did similar work and I said we couldn't go to the <span class="interior space">toilets</span>, also we couldn't use their <span class="interior space">cafeteria</span>, we had to bring our own lunch and sort of eat it at our <span class="spatial object">work desk</span> and of course, we had no right to vacation time. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And, but through my friend Hans Fabisch, whom I mentioned earlier and who was training to become a physician, he sort of advised me on certain back symptoms which cannot be traced by a doctor which are purely subjective, but make you incapable of working, it has to sort of hurt at a certain point and when the doctor pushes this way it hurts more and that way it hurts less, and so I feigned that and so I received an official sort of a statement, yeah, as a Jew I couldn't just call in, I'm sick today, you had to have a physician certified written statement, you know, that <span class="populated place">Ernest Fontheim</span>, you know, has blah, blah, such and such a sickness or disease and is not capable to come to work. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So anyway, I got that following his instructions, that was in the latter part of December. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So on December 24th, then I was at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1194">I want to come back, I said earlier in this interview, that Christmas played a special role in our family and I meant that in many ways, it played a role as I grew up because we always had a <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span> and we, and Santa Claus came and we had gifts. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Well, on the 24th of December, 1942, my parents were arrested and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And it happened this way. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I was actually that was when I was on that fake sick leave and I had left the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to make a phone call from a <span class="spatial object">public phone</span>, as I said we didn't have a <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1198"><span class="spatial object">Public phones</span> were also prohibited to Jews but by walking a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and hiding my star I could then go into a <span class="building">booth</span> and I was making a call to the parents of Margot, whom I had met sometime earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And they had a phone because they were  1 subletting an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that was in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and since she was not a German citizen, all these German laws, these antisemitic laws, did not apply to her, even though she was a Jew, but so anyway, so they had that phone and I called them up, I don't even know why anymore, it doesn't make a difference, but when I went back, we lived now in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with these relatives of ours that I described earlier, which was a second <span class="interior space">floor</span> <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and as I approached the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, I noticed my sister, Eva, leaning out the <span class="dlf">window</span> and waving me away. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And I knew immediately, in those days you knew always what was happening on a signal. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And so I walked away, I knew the people were there to pick my family up. </sentence><sentence id="1202">So I walked just maybe 50 yards or so back so that I was still in view and watched what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And then after a while the janitor came, the janitor actually happened to be also a Jew, but lived in a mixed marriage and was protected therefore by, through the Nazi laws. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And he came and said I should come up, the people who came for the <span class="spatial object">pickup</span> were actually Jewish orderlies and they go strictly by lists and my name, there were just the names of both parents and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1205">So I went up and there was total frenzy at <span class="building">home</span>, of course, and my father was again out, he had done the same thing, and one of the orderlies had already gone down to call the Gestapo to say that he was not, could not be transported. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And he came back after, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes saying he was told that my father has to be brought under whatever circumstances, even if they have to carry him down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> in a <span class="spatial object">chair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And then my parents were frantically packing, I mean most people had already most of the things packed and so did they, but there are some last minute things. </sentence><sentence id="1208">My father was not completely out in a coma, but in a very weakened state and he took my hands and said we will never see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And then my sister suddenly out of the blue, threw her  2 arms around my neck and had an incredible crying spell. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Her whole body shook and I kept her close and I frequently thought to myself why I simply did not take her and walk out with her. </sentence><sentence id="1211">That is a question which I have asked myself ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Then when the preparations were done, my father was actually really carried down the <span class="dlf">steps</span> in a <span class="spatial object">chair</span>; and the picking up of Jews was done by a moving <span class="spatial object">van</span> from a company that I'll never forget, the name was Scheffler. </sentence><sentence id="1213">Of course, the Gestapo presumably leased those <span class="spatial object">vans</span>, and inside the <span class="spatial object">vans</span> they had long <span class="spatial object">benches</span> where the Jews that were picked up were sort of lined up and then sitting until it was full and then the <span class="spatial object">van</span> would go to the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1214">By that time the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> had shifted from the <span class="building">synagogue</span> where it used to be still in April, to a former <span class="building">old age home</span> of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1272">Q: And your sister, your mother and father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1274">A: Yeah, and actually, I decided to ride along in that <span class="spatial object">van</span> for some <span class="dlf">blocks</span> to be together with them some more. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And then at the corner of <span class="dlf">Giintzelstrasse</span> and <span class="dlf">Trautenaustrasse</span> I said goodbye and jumped out the back and that was the last time I saw my parents and my sister on December 24, 1942, Christmas Eve. </sentence><sentence id="1276">On the next day our doorbell rang and when I opened, I was surprised to see my former mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, from the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1277">He told me that he was serving as an orderly in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and had a message from my mother, and he added that it was strictly forbidden for orderlies to make any communication between people in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and people outside, but since I had been his student for quite a number of years and he knew me already as a smaller boy, he did it out of a gesture of friendship. </sentence><sentence id="1278">He told me first of all that my mother had forgotten certain things that he offered to bring in and they would also be glad if I could pack some additional food and then he added that my mother also told him  3 that she was interrogated the day they arrived there by the Gestapo, and the Gestapo showed particular interest in me. </sentence><sentence id="1279">They wanted to know what hours I work, when I come <span class="building">home</span> from work, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And I knew immediately that that was a message and obviously the message was never to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1281">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1282">At that point I had no place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But as I just mentioned earlier, the parents of my co-worker, Margot, in whom I had been interested at first, lived, sublet an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that was actually registered in the name of a Hungarian Jewish woman and, therefore, was not on the Gestapo list. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And they had a small sort of a <span class="interior space">maid's room</span>, aside of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> but it belonged to it, which they used for <span class="interior space">storage</span>, but they said that I could stay there and sleep there also. </sentence><sentence id="1285">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1286">On New Year's Eve, December 31, first of all I knew at that time that no <span class="spatial object">transport</span> had left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, so I knew that my parents were still there and I was there with Margot and her parents and also with a friend of theirs, I forgot his name, he was sort of an elderly man, about 60, in his 60's, and his entire family had been arrested, but he had some contact to the Gestapo and was negotiating with them to bribe them to get his family out. </sentence><sentence id="1287">And he was supposed to meet his Gestapo contact the next day, but he also knew the Gestapo had power to do anything; they could just take whatever he had to offer, arrest him too and laugh in his face. </sentence><sentence id="1288">And that New Year's Eve was the most horrible New Year's Eve that I ever had in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1289">My parents and sister were in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, my girlfriend Ruth was already long gone and I didn't know what would become of me and that man was there with his horror story. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The atmosphere was so unbelievably gloomy that it is even hard to describe. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I kept in touch with my friend Hans Farbisch, of course, and he actually had met a physician, a Jewish physician whom he was going to marry. </sentence><sentence id="1292">She was a few years older than he and she was Austrian so that's  4 why, otherwise a person of that age wouldn't have had a medical degree in <span class="country">Germany</span> because in <span class="country">Germany</span> a Jew couldn't study any more since 1933, but coming from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, she could study until "38. </sentence><sentence id="1293">Anyway, she had her medical degree and her name was Valli and they got married in the first week of January, wait a minute, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And Hans and I discussed the possibility maybe of going <span class="interior space">underground</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="1295">But a basic difference of opinion developed between Hans and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1296">He, his philosophy was that as long as we were employed at <span class="building">Siemens</span>, we were protected and deferred from deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1297">On the other hand, if we went <span class="interior space">underground</span> and were caught in some ID check on the <span class="dlf">street</span> without a star, that meant immediate deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Therefore, he felt at this point it was much safer if we stayed legal, quote, worked at <span class="building">Siemens</span> and were protected that way and then go <span class="interior space">underground</span> whenever the, you know, the deferment would no longer be valid or Siemens might lay us off or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I, on the other hand, argued that the Gestapo was not going to send us printed invitations or announcements saying now you are no longer protected and deferred. </sentence><sentence id="1300">That is going to come overnight without that anybody knows it and then it's going to be too late. </sentence><sentence id="1301">It is true right now it is safer to be walking around with a star and working at <span class="building">Siemens</span> because that is protection, but because of the uncertainty of how long that is going to last, there is no, that risk we have to take. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And there was another point, in fact, which leads me to briefly flash back to our time at <span class="building">Siemens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1303">I had forgotten to mention that already since the fall of 1942, we received in our department forced laborers from occupied, <span class="region">German occupied territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1304">It started out with a group of French women and after a while, we also got Polish women to work in our <span class="building">department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1305">These were all people who were deported, obviously, against all international law and without their consent, into <span class="country">Germany</span> to work for war production. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And | also referred to  5 that in talking to Hans, that it's very obvious, first of all the Germans have millions and millions of people in the <span class="region">occupied territories</span> and a few tens of thousands of Jews, so I, why do they need a few tens of thousands of Jews if they can be replaced from a <span class="interior space">pool</span> that has millions of people. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And they have already started to introduce these people in our <span class="building">department</span> and they know already how to do the things that we are doing, so I think that probably the time is imminent even that these deferments for work in <span class="building">defense plants</span> are going to lapse. </sentence><sentence id="1308">But we did not, obviously, resolve that difference of opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Hans himself felt that for the time being he was safer that way. </sentence><sentence id="1310">He did, however, do one thing and that is to order forged ID's. </sentence><sentence id="1311">A forged ID at least for himself to go, it was practically impossible to live in <span class="country">Germany</span> without some sort of an ID because there were frequent checks for identification on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, there was a whole spectrum of <span class="building">agencies</span> who could do that in addition to just the ordinary police, there was the Gestapo, of course, which was essentially a political police, there was the so-called criminal police, these were detectives looking for common criminals, there was the military police, there was a so-called labor police and probably other <span class="building">agencies</span> that I wasn't even aware of. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So, basically, it was definitely necessary to have forged identification papers because if you were asked for an identification on the, by any one of these <span class="building">agencies</span>, and you were not able to identify yourself to their satisfaction, that meant immediate arrest. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Margot's father had a contact that could provide a forged identification as an employee for the, an organization called Deutsche Arbeitsfront, which means in English, German Labor Front. </sentence><sentence id="1314">End of side one of tape three. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1356">Q: This is tape three, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim continued on March 13, 1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence><sentence id="1357"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1358">A: This organization, the German Labor Front, was the Nazi answer, basically, to labor unions. </sentence><sentence id="1359">They had smashed, of course, the labor unions and declared them illegal and also they declared that their ideology, this whole idea of class warfare and of a sort of adversarial relationship between management and labor is not in the sense of Germanic nationalism. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Instead they formed this German Labor Front which contained members both of the employed laborers and employees and of management and owners and the supposed idea was that in this forum, before conflicts arise, all issues will be discussed in a cooperative way because both <span class="region">sides</span> are obviously interested in the flourishing of the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1361">This whole idea might have sounded good on paper, but it was, of course, done mainly in order to smash the voice of the workers and to enable German industry to increase production and mainly war production, without any disruptions. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So, Margot's father had some contact and for roughly the sum of fifteen hundred German Reichsmark, which was the currency at that time, the opportunity, fifteen hundred apiece, of course, to obtain ID's as an employee with the German Labor Front. </sentence><sentence id="1363">This was, of course, a very prestigious organization and so, and the ID also contained a passport picture of the person, the obviously name, birthdate, address and so on and then a rubber stamp numbered one, two, three, four, five, to be stamped, I think, semiannually, so that it also had the impression of being updated on a semiannual basis. </sentence><sentence id="1364">The rubber stamp came, was just a number, came with the ID itself so we could sort of revalidate it every six months for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Hans also agreed to buy this ID and sort of put it away in case when the situation is what he considers ripe to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1366">In the meantime, as I had mentioned earlier, I was already no longer living in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because of the hidden warning that my mother had conveyed to me and I lived in a small <span class="interior space">maid's room</span> of the  7 <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of Margot's parents, but during the day commuted to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because I had decided to save as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And, incidentally, I should also add that at that time, my parents and sister were still in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> in that former <span class="building">Jewish old age home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Only after the war, in fact fairly recently with publications of the history and so on, did I learn of the brutal conditions in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1369">I mean, I never thought that there would be nice conditions, but at least I thought, since it was an <span class="building">old age home</span>, there would be <span class="spatial object">beds</span> in there and they would at least have some form of amenities. </sentence><sentence id="1370">I learned now that a, some so-called specialists in Jewish emigration from the <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> SS had been gotten to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on the orders of Adolf Eichmann and also to speed up the deportation of Jews, and the first thing they, that the man in charge was a man named Alois Brunner incidentally, his rank was SS Hauptsturmfihrer. </sentence><sentence id="1371">The fact that he was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, in fact, was known at that time, but what was not known is that his first act after arriving and looking at the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> in that former <span class="building">old age home</span>, that he ordered that all <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> be thrown out the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and that was literally done, they were thrown out of the <span class="dlf">windows</span>, even though there was a shortage of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> for Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And there were just bare <span class="interior space">floors</span> so he could pack more Jews into the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And so even in that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> already, they must have lived under very miserable circumstances. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1374">Q: How long was your family in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1376">A: That comes to, their <span class="spatial object">transport</span> left on the 12th of January, it was a Tuesday and an unbelievably unusually cold day, even for <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And the departure of a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> became known within hours always in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because that couldn't, you know, there were what, a thousand people were marched from the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> to the nearest, they didn't go to a regular <span class="building">railroad station</span>, but to a freight <span class="interior space">yard</span> where they were loaded on like cattle. </sentence><sentence id="1378"> 8 The, as I had said earlier, the arrest of my parents took place on December 24th and I guess in order to allow the SS some Christmas vacation from their strenuous activities, no <span class="spatial object">transport</span> went away from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> between December 24th and January 12th, so they were there almost three weeks, two and a half weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1382">Q: Were you at <span class="building">work</span> when they left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1384">A: No, I, as I explained earlier, I was on that faked sick leave and I simply never went back. </sentence><sentence id="1385">The sick leave, of course, was limited to, I forgot what it was, a certain number of days, maybe a week, but by never going back then I was hoping that my absence wouldn't be immediately noticed because obviously, if somebody was just absent, they would immediately send orders for the arrest of that person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1388">Q: So, where were you when the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> left, did you see this procession? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1390">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1391">I didn't see, I just heard that also through the <span class="spatial object">mouth radio</span> that I had mentioned also at some point, that when, actually considering how primitive it was and that we didn't even have <span class="spatial object">telephones</span>, was incredibly efficient how it went from, these things went from <span class="interior space">mouth</span> to mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Yeah, let me see. </sentence><sentence id="1393">During that time, as I said, we, I lived at the, in that <span class="interior space">maid's room</span> at the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of Margot's parents which was really very far away in distance from our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where we lived, so every day I went there to pack things, yeah, and my plan was to have as much of personal effects and so on picked up by a <span class="building">moving company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1394">That <span class="building">moving company</span> had been a client of my father's when he was still practicing law, I still remember the name was Gebriider Zimmermann, which means Brothers Zimmermann. </sentence><sentence id="1395">The owner actually was a Mr. Schtitt and who was very, I must say, was a fantastic man and he knew of course that we are Jews and he stuck with us, he had already from our nice <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where we were thrown out, a lot of  9 <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> stored in his storage place under a different name, and so that it couldn't be traced. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And I went to him and told him that my parents had been arrested and would be deported and I wanted to save more things and he immediately agreed and the <span class="spatial object">pickup</span> then was supposed to come on January 19th and I was supposed to designate all the pieces that were supposed to be picked up and there were certain pieces of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> that I thought maybe at one time I might want to sell. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And also, a <span class="spatial object">trunk</span> full of all kinds of personal articles, it also contained the diary of my sister, she had kept a diary for a long time and also particularly, the letter that my sister had written to me when she was, as a harvest helper away from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and I had written to her of the arrest of my girlfriend, Ruth. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And so I was busy then every day for a few hours in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and always left considerably earlier than I would have come back had I worked, so that I wouldn't be running into some trap by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1399">On the 18th of January, it was one day before I had ordered the <span class="spatial object">van</span>, the <span class="spatial object">moving van</span>, to come. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I was again doing some last packing to finish up for the <span class="spatial object">pickup</span> on the next day, when one of the women I had mentioned earlier that there were quite a number of people living, had been living in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, one of the women came and reported that the infamous <span class="spatial object">pickup</span>, <span class="spatial object">moving van</span>, was in the <span class="dlf">Brandenburgische Strasse</span>, that is the <span class="dlf">street</span> where my friend Hans was living. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I think I had mentioned that the pickup of Jews for deportation was done by a <span class="spatial object">furniture van</span>, a <span class="spatial object">furniture moving van</span>, of the firm <span class="building">Scheffler</span> and <span class="dlf">Brandenburgische Strasse</span>, as I said, was the <span class="dlf">street</span> where my friend Hans was living, although that was in midmorning and I knew that Hans was at work at <span class="building">Siemens</span>, but his wife, Valli, did not work and might be at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1402">So I immediately grabbed my coat and raced, it was several blocks away from where our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was, and then I turned the corner into <span class="dlf">Brandenburgische Strasse</span> and saw that  0 <span class="spatial object">van</span> parked right in front of their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And it struck me like lightening, I stopped for a few seconds, considering how that <span class="building">house</span> also like all <span class="building">houses</span> where Jews lived, of course, was a so-called <span class="building">Jew house</span> which meant that there was a large number of Jewish parties, and I figured that the probability that they were just in their <span class="interior space">apartment</span> is probably small, and at any rate, I would never be able to face my friend if I didn't do anything I could to get his wife out. </sentence><sentence id="1404">So, and they lived, it was a walk-up on the <span class="interior space">fifth floor</span>, I raced up the <span class="dlf">steps</span>, rang the bell and they had sublet one <span class="interior space">room</span>, just in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which was rented by a Mrs. Striem, and the <span class="dlf">door</span>, Mrs. Striem opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, her face looked horrible, as white as even more white than this <span class="dlf">wall</span> here, like this <span class="spatial object">cuff</span>, I've never seen her like that. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And she looked completely dejected and all she said, "what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1406">Get away quickly!" </sentence><sentence id="1407">And then instead of turning and running, I asked, "is <span class="populated place">Valli</span>, I want to talk to Valli". </sentence><sentence id="1408">Then she repeated, "get away!" </sentence><sentence id="1409">And upon that, I saw behind her a man in an SS uniform appearing and at that point I turned around and raced down and was on the <span class="dlf">landing</span> below when I heard a thunderous voice in a Viennese dialect saying, halt immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And I turned around, I saw an SS officer leaning over the <span class="dlf">balustrade</span> and with a drawn pistol pointing at me. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And I got such a shock of scare that almost my knees buckled under me and I walked back up and he got me in, closed the <span class="dlf">door</span> and the first thing, your papers. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And then I pulled out my forged ID from the <span class="populated place">German Labor Front</span> which he looked at carefully and compared my face with the picture on the ID and then he barked at me what I was doing there. </sentence><sentence id="1413">You know, because there was supposed to be no contact between so-called Aryans and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And, of course, the question totally caught me by surprise and I was so devastated and fearful anyway that I couldn't think straight so all I could blurt out was that the Jew who lives here still owes me some money which  1 in that respect was stupid and the guy didn't even catch it because if he owed me money, that meant that I must have loaned it to him and if I loaned him money, what business did Ihave loaning money to a Jew, but he didn't pursue it. </sentence><sentence id="1415">But instead, he took my ID put it in his uniform pocket and said, I want to ask you some more questions tomorrow, I want you to come to my <span class="building">office</span> at <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>, such and such <span class="dlf">street</span> address, <span class="interior space">room</span> number so and so, I forgot that, but I do remember at 9:00 tomorrow morning I want to see you there and then you will get your ID back. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And then I left and I felt as if I had sort of escaped from hell, that was one of the two or three scariest episodes in my entire life. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I went down, but I had at least one thing, while we were standing, that little conversation took place inside their <span class="dlf">door</span>, in a little sort of like a <span class="interior space">vestibule</span>, and the various <span class="interior space">rooms</span> went off it, and in <span class="interior space">Hans" room</span> I didn't see a person. </sentence><sentence id="1418">So it seemed to me that <span class="populated place">Valli</span> wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So as I raced down as quickly as possible because I thought maybe the guy changes his mind, I decided, then I walked out of the <span class="building">house</span> to the <span class="dlf">street</span> and to the next <span class="dlf">corner</span> was several <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1420">So I walked to the next <span class="dlf">corner</span> and around the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, but then I positioned myself there on the <span class="dlf">corner</span> so I could see who approached the <span class="building">house</span> and I was hoping that if Valli would come, that I could signal or shout at her and get her away. </sentence><sentence id="1421">It was also a cold winter day, the 18th of January, and I stood there. </sentence><sentence id="1422">In the meantime, that <span class="spatial object">van</span> had already left, but it was known that sometimes if a person that they were looking for wasn't there, they left somebody behind so that's why I stuck there until my legs were really like just columns of <span class="env feature">ice</span> and I couldn't stand it anymore, and at 4:00 also was shift change, I felt I had to notify Hans. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And, of course, that was a tricky thing because I was by that time, away without, from work without permission, so I couldn't be seen there. </sentence><sentence id="1424">So I went to the <span class="building">elevated station</span> that we went to when we went to work at <span class="building">Siemens</span> and  2 then walked toward the <span class="building">factory</span>, but didn't walk all the way, but sort of hid in the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of an <span class="building">apartment building</span> which was still a <span class="dlf">block</span> or two away from the <span class="building">factory</span>, but where people at the shift change would sort of stream past. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And of course, by that time it was winter, it was already fairly dark. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So I stood there and then when Hans came by, I whistled to him and he stopped and was surprised to see me and I told him the events of the morning and of course, he got very depressed and agitated by that. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Anyway, we went then together back, and then when we arrived in front of his <span class="building">house</span> and looked up, there was the. </sentence><sentence id="1428">In wartime <span class="dlf">windows</span> had to be darkened in order not to give away locations to enemy <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, but often, I mean not often but always, there was sort of a small slit of light coming just from the edge where the curtain just quite didn't hit the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And we saw some light coming out of his <span class="interior space">apartment</span> so we both felt somebody must be <span class="building">home</span> at least. </sentence><sentence id="1430">So we rushed up and on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> below, Hans turned to me and said, you know, why don't you wait here. </sentence><sentence id="1431">I'll go up and if everything is clear, I'll call you. </sentence><sentence id="1432">So I stood one <span class="interior space">floor</span> below and watched him and he put the key into the lock but hadn't turned it yet, when the <span class="dlf">door</span> opened from the inside. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And I saw a tall grey haired civilian opening the <span class="dlf">door</span> who didn't belong there, never seen before in my life, and he immediately looked down and shouted to me, who are you? </sentence><sentence id="1434">And then I turned around and ran as fast as I could. </sentence><sentence id="1435">I never ran as fast in my life, I think, and that was the last time I saw Hans. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And as sort of a sideline, that was the 18th of January, 1943, exactly to the day five years later that my <span class="building">high school</span> friend from that <span class="building">orthodox high school</span>, on the 18th of January, "39, no four years later I guess, left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to emigrate to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So I left I guess the two best friends that I had in my life, I lost on the same day, on the 18th of January, the only thing is the one who left for <span class="country">England</span>, left for life and he is still alive, he's in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="1438"> 3 So then I went back again to Margot's parents and there was a terrible argument. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Her father accused me that I was reckless, that I should have never, by having that ID confiscated that means now that ID may even be useless now because the Gestapo knows, they obviously are going to find out that this is a forged ID and I was endangering everybody else and so we had a big argument about that. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And then, not only that, but I probably overreacted and overestimated the efficiency of the Gestapo, but at that time I thought they could probably lift my fingerprints from that ID, and all Jews had been fingerprinted already, years before, so they had a fingerprint file of all Jews and experienced criminologists can match fingerprints, so it occurred to me that, what if they match my fingerprint, find out who I really, who the owner of that ID really was and then come to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and if the moving <span class="spatial object">van</span> is just there, they will immediately find out that this is being picked up, you know, by that firm of Zimmermann and that will lead them to me somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So I called up the <span class="building">firm</span> and cancelled the <span class="spatial object">pickup</span> and that was one of the most horrible mistakes of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1442">It wasn't the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, but it was the personal things that were contained in the <span class="spatial object">trunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1443">The <span class="spatial object">trunk</span> contained my sister's diary, her letters, including the letter that she had written to me after the arrest of Ruth and I never went back to that <span class="building">building</span> simply because I was afraid that it might be staked out. </sentence><sentence id="1444">While the Gestapo, as far as I know, never looked just for Jews who were in hiding in particular, but in a case where there was a forged ID from an important <span class="building">Nazi agency</span>, they would surely be interested in finding out how that ID was obtained, from whom, etcetera, etcetera, so that would have been worthwhile to stake that address out. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I just, in retrospect, don't believe that they were that efficient that they would have had all of that figured out within less than a day, but at that time, I felt strongly that it was too unsafe to go back and also  4 too unsafe to have the <span class="building">moving company</span> come because that would have led them to me. </sentence><sentence id="1446">The result of this is that I have no personal belongings of my sister whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="1447">I have pictures, of course, but that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1448">We intensified now the search for a place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Margot's parents, and incidentally, and of course I immediately had to practically move <span class="env feature">mountains</span> to get another ID. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Margot's parents were also planning to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>, but didn't, had one or two possible sort of options, none of which was ideal. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Then I came up with an idea and that was the former office supervisor of my father's <span class="building">law office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1452">It was a <span class="building">Mrs. Frieda Kunze</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1453">She was actually a marvelous person. </sentence><sentence id="1454">She had been in his <span class="building">office</span> as far back as I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I don't know whether she was there since before I was born or since I was a little boy, but as long as remember. </sentence><sentence id="1456">As a little boy whenever I was taken to the <span class="building">office</span>, she was already working for my father and in the last years, she was his <span class="building">office</span> supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And she held to us even after my father lost his license to practice and, of course, then she lost that job. </sentence><sentence id="1458">She visited us frequently and I remember often she brought us food even, that she had taken from her own not very generous rations. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And she owned a primitive <span class="building">weekend cottage</span> in a <span class="populated place">village</span> about roughly 35 miles southeast of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And I didn't, all I knew is that she owned that place, I didn't know, I had never been there, what it was like or so, but I went to her and, of course, I told her also that my parents and sister had been arrested and I told her that whether we could make some arrangement that I and also a family of friends, that's a couple and a daughter, could live in that <span class="building">cottage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And she said that, you know, because my father was such a marvelous boss for decades for her and she also considered herself as a friend of the family, that she would do anything to save my life. </sentence><sentence id="1462">On the other hand, she wasn't so sure whether that <span class="building">cottage</span> really was the right place, she repeated again that it was very primitive and maybe  5 we ought to look at it. </sentence><sentence id="1463">So first of all, of course, I introduced her to Margot's parents, I think it was even the next day, we all went to her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and sort of got acquainted and then we agreed on a day when we would together travel out and look at the place. </sentence><sentence id="1464">She said she hadn't been there even for a year or two and that it may be in a very rundown state. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So we went out there and it was sort of a <span class="populated place">settlement</span>, this is a sort of German custom actually, that there were settlements of <span class="populated place">colonies</span>, sort of <span class="populated place">colonies</span> of <span class="building">cottages</span> with very small pieces of <span class="region">land</span> like <span class="dlf">gardens</span> around them, which sort of say <span class="region">lower middle</span> class Germans would own to have a place to go to on weekends. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And so we went there and looked at the place. </sentence><sentence id="1467">It was again a cold winter day and the first thing we noticed was that the <span class="dlf">roof</span> was leaking and the <span class="building">cottage</span> was really very primitive, there was of course, no inside running water, there was a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> in front of the <span class="building">house</span> in the <span class="dlf">garden</span> and, of course, there was no electricity, there was an oil lamp there, but for that one had to buy sort of a particular kind of petroleum which was almost impossible to get. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Also one could use candles, which also were hard to get. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And then for heating, basically, there was a <span class="spatial object">kitchen stove</span> which served both as a <span class="spatial object">stove</span> for heating and as a <span class="spatial object">stove</span> for cooking, it was sort of a cast iron sort of a rectangular body on cast iron legs and on top there were sort of concentric rings of iron which could be taken out and <span class="spatial object">pots</span> of different sizes put in there to heat things and cook things. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And that was all there was and the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, obviously, was very primitive, there were two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and a sort of a <span class="interior space">veranda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And we were desperate and so anyway, we said we would have to make do and she agreed to let us have the place and, of course, she impressed on us the need to be extremely careful and, but I mean, we were aware of that ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1472">Our punishment would have been  6 <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> if we would have been not careful and would have been discovered and she would have probably also wound up in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1556">Q: What about the neighbors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1558">A: Yeah, I'm coming to that. </sentence><sentence id="1559">I mean that was just a visit there. </sentence><sentence id="1560">So she let it, and she didn't take, she took a small rent, I forgot what it was any more, it may have been on the order of 40 to 50 mark per month, which at that time was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And the <span class="dlf">garden</span>, incidentally, contained a number of marvelous <span class="env feature">fruit trees</span>, some cherry and also <span class="env feature">plum trees</span> and even the, and she told us we could use the harvest and the harvest was so rich that in terms of <span class="building">black market</span> money, that was almost more than the 40 or 50 mark that we paid her for the rent. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And yeah, okay, so then we, that was agreed upon and then we decided we would move out there as soon as possible, having, you know, we had to settle certain affairs, but I didn't, I was out of our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and that was it and everything in there was gone as far as I was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1563">But I had, the only things I had taken, of course, personal items like clothing along already to the <span class="interior space">maid's room</span> at Margot's parent's <span class="building">house</span> so I was all set up to move there. </sentence><sentence id="1564">But they had to pack their things yet and that took a few days and then actually on the 30th of January, 1943, we moved out to that, the name of the <span class="populated place">village</span>, incidentally, was <span class="populated place">Senzig</span>, S-E-N-Z-I-G. And now a completely different life started for us. </sentence><sentence id="1565">I considered it at the time a real adventure, first of all, I was finally off that continuous pressure that was increasing by the month of whether to be picked up and to be deported and I felt for the first time in years, like a free person and I also felt that I somehow I am in control of my life now, which I wasn't before. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And furthermore, I mean the threat was lifted and I could do what I wanted to do, not exactly actually, but at least in a limited way. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Yeah, there were obviously many, many things  7 now to consider. </sentence><sentence id="1568">The first item was money. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I have to, again, sort of back track a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1570">My father had stored away some, what was called black money, in the years before his arrest, because all Jewish assets, even if they were not confiscated, were blocked by the German authority, by basically the German equivalent of the IRS, the Treasury <span class="building">Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1571">That meant that these assets still belonged to the particular Jewish owner, but he could not, he or she could not freely dispose of them. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Each family had, was given by the Gestapo, a maximum amount of money it could spend per month and withdraw from the <span class="spatial object">bank account</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1573">Obviously, that was all in preparation for confiscation. </sentence><sentence id="1574">They wanted to prevent that Jews stash away money. </sentence><sentence id="1575">So and that was based entirely on the size of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1576">Like we were four people. </sentence><sentence id="1577">So I don't know what the amount was, but my father had a certain amount of money, maximum amount that he could spend. </sentence><sentence id="1578">And anything that he sold or so on, had to be paid into that blocked account also. </sentence><sentence id="1579">But my father did particularly at the time when our big <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was given up, he sold many items under the hand and established black accounts with a number of friends, basically three. </sentence><sentence id="1580">Two of them were former, no, one of them was a former client, that was a very interesting man whom I'll talk about a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="1581">He was a furrier and, in fact, he had the largest, probably the most prominent <span class="building">fur business</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1582">One of his customers, in fact, was none other than Hermann Goring, one of the top Nazis and commander in chief of the air force in addition to many other <span class="building">offices</span> that he held. </sentence><sentence id="1583">And his name was Walter Lange and, in fact, he had a Jewish wife and he told us that Gering called him up in the summer of 1939 telling him, if you want to, your wife to be safe, get her out now and I'll see to it that anything that she wants to take out, she can. </sentence><sentence id="1584">At that time, an ordinary Jew who emigrated, could take out only very limited amounts of valuables and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And he  8 shipped his wife out with I know oriental rugs and other valuables to <span class="country">England</span> and they had a son, by the way, and the son also, so they were now in safety in <span class="country">England</span>, safety except for German air raids, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1586">But, of course, he conducted, kept conducting his business. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And he, I forgot what the exact amounts of money were, but it was a fairly sizeable amount that he kept in a separate account for my father. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And my father had told him and also the others that if anything happened to him, then I should have access to these assets. </sentence><sentence id="1589">The second person was actually the father of the German lawyer whom I had mentioned earlier who had warned my father of his imminent arrest after Kristallnacht and I think I mentioned at the time, that the father of this lawyer had been a Minister of the <span class="interior space">Interior</span> in one of the pre-Hitler governments of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1590">The son, the lawyer himself, who had warned my father, was by that time, of course, drafted and was an officer in the Wehrmacht, but the father was an elderly gentleman and he kept also a sizeable amount of money for my father and also was informed that I should have access to these assets. </sentence><sentence id="1591">The third person was my father's former accountant and tax advisor. </sentence><sentence id="1592">He actually had the smallest amount, but also I think it was somewhere between five and ten thousand <span class="region">Deutsche Reichsmark</span>, which was at that time fairly sizeable. </sentence><sentence id="1593">The interesting thing is that he was the only one who cheated me of the money. </sentence><sentence id="1594">Obviously, because of the danger for them and for us, no receipts were ever exchanged, I mean it was all just by word of honor. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And when I came to claim part of the money, he told me with a straight face, and in fact, that was at the time that my father was still in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, and he told me with a straight face that unfortunately my father did not follow his advice to let him keep the money, but he picked the money up about three or  9 four months ago and he advised my father that was not a good idea, that he should, it would be better for the safety of the money if he would keep the money. </sentence><sentence id="1596">End of side tape three. </sentence><sentence id="1597">Tape 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1638">Q: This is tape four, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13, 1997. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1640">The interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1641">A: Yeah, <span class="region">IL</span> then had my father asked about that, as I explained earlier, my former mathematics teacher, Dr. Baer, was an orderly employed in that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and he brought messages back and forth between my father and myself and also every day I made sandwiches for them and he would take them in. </sentence><sentence id="1642">And I sent a sort of, obviously, cloaked message just saying that the accountant said that he had picked everything up and my father sent a message back, that is definitely not so and he has everything. </sentence><sentence id="1643">So I went back to the accountant for a second time and told him the message of my father and he became then at first just unfriendly, but when I kept persisting, he pointed to the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> and said if I don't leave him alone, you know, he has one <span class="spatial object">phone</span> call to make to the police and then I can explain to them that he owes me money. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Well at that point, I turned around and left and I guess that's one of these unfortunate experiences. </sentence><sentence id="1645">So money was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1646">Another problem was, of course, how to arrange our lives there. </sentence><sentence id="1647">We, these <span class="dlf">plots</span> in these <span class="populated place">settlements</span> are very close together, you cannot live there literally in hiding and avoid people, in fact, that would have aroused suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Neighbors are traditionally, in these <span class="populated place">settlements</span>, very close, talk to each other and so on, so we decided we, first of all, we have to have a believable story, you know, who we are and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1649">So we concocted a whole sort of curriculum vitae for ourselves and the story was, our papers  0 incidentally were all made in the last name of <span class="populated place">Hesse</span>, mine, too, H-E-S-S-E. And the story was that this was a couple with their daughter, Margot, and I was a nephew, in other words, the son of Mr. Hesse's brother. </sentence><sentence id="1650">And my parents had been killed in an accident while I was still a baby and I had been raised by my aunt and uncle and so. </sentence><sentence id="1651">They were almost total strangers to me, I just met them a few months before, but I had to train myself to address them in the sort of familiar German Du form and also, instead of calling them Mr. or Mrs. Hesse, I had to call them Uncle Hermann and Aunt Lucy. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And incidentally, the name Hermann Hesse also was chosen because from the telephone book, that actually Mr. Hesse found that out, there existed a real Hermann Hesse at a <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> address and that was the address that we gave. </sentence><sentence id="1653">So if somebody just made a cursory check, say with our ID, there existed such a person at the address that we gave. </sentence><sentence id="1654">Okay, we also had to have credible stories of what our lives were like. </sentence><sentence id="1655">For example in my case, a German, which I pretended to be, would normally be inducted into the army and, of course, I was a civilian. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Now I, after my ID was taken away by the SS, from the German Labor Front, I acquired after a few months another ID as a technician in one of the major <span class="building">German defense plants</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And that, of course, was in itself an excellent alibi because a person of such technical expertise would be deferred from military service. </sentence><sentence id="1658">However, I should also add that the ID requirements were much more rigorous. </sentence><sentence id="1659">For example, every male of military age, and I don't remember any more up to what age that was, but surely much more than my age at that time which was 20. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Every such person had to have military papers. </sentence><sentence id="1661">If the person was actually a member of the Wehrmacht, it means of any one of the three branches, army, navy or air force, the person had to have a Militarpass, military pass, with picture, identifying the unit, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1662">If the  1 person was exempt from military service for whatever reason, then also a military paper with picture and other personal information, stating that reason, be it deferment for job reasons or maybe for health reasons, somebody may have had only one leg, for example, the paper would have to state what the reason was and that also had to be carried on the person and shown on request. </sentence><sentence id="1663">In the case of job deferment, in fact that paper was only issued for a limited time, I forgot exactly but I believe it was six months. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So after, it had to be revalidated every six months. </sentence><sentence id="1665">That made it very difficult to obtain forgeries. </sentence><sentence id="1666">First of all, forgeries of military papers were very rare and hard to get in the first place, and then it was only valid for six months; then it had to be revalidated. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And as I said, I had now obtained an ID as a technician for a <span class="building">defense plant</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and I, and with that I lived for the rest of the war, showing it the many times that I was asked for an ID and in fact, it was convincing enough so that there was never a follow-up question, but I was aware of the fact that each time the official asking me to identify myself could have asked where is your Wehrmacht ID? </sentence><sentence id="1668">And then I had already prepared one fall back and that was that I would pretend to go through the, I would actually go through the pockets of my jacket and pretend to look for the paper and then with surprise on my face say, ah, I must have left it in the coat that I wore yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And at that point, the official could have said, well, I believe you this time, but be sure don't forget it again. </sentence><sentence id="1670">He could, however also, have told me, in that case I have to take you along to check you out, in which case I would have been done. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And in fact, that never occurred and in all of my cases where I was controlled for ID, that ID that I had and the one that I obtained later that I will discuss then, was sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I think that also had to do with the fact that I had learned by living in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> since "33 and by being in that <span class="building">Nazi gymnasium</span> or <span class="building">high school</span> for  2 two years from "33 to "35, I had learned exactly the correct Nazi demeanor. </sentence><sentence id="1673">They were in many ways sort of very naive almost bordering on the childish. </sentence><sentence id="1674">For example, whenever I was asked for an ID, before I did anything like showing my ID, I would in this military demeanor click my heels, I had special heels for that with sort of iron or steel plates to provide the impressive military click that German soldiers had, I would stretch out my right arm, say a snappy Heil Hitler, and then I would show my, and such silly little things would make just the right impression and would dispel any, in most cases at least, any suspicion that I could be anything but a convinced and truthful Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1675">Yeah, that was my case. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Then the case of Mr. Hesse, Margot's father, he was actually by profession a tailor and pattern maker and had owned a <span class="building">women's coat factory</span> in earlier years, in the "30's, and then when forced labor came, he was actually drafted into a uniform, military <span class="building">uniform factory</span> and had also, even though he was a Jew, a position of sort of a supervisory position there because of his background and knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1677">So he carried that, continued that and also said that he was in such a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1678">In addition to that of course, he had the ID for the <span class="building">Deutsche Arbeitsfront</span>, which was sort of like a secondary position he pretended. </sentence><sentence id="1679">Margot's mother had an undefined <span class="building">office</span> job in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and Margot herself actually was by training a baby nurse and she worked in sort of a <span class="interior space">German nursery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1680">These started to spring up now, today they would be called <span class="building">day care centers</span>, because many German women were not exactly forcibly drafted to work in <span class="building">factories</span>, but they were strongly coerced and urged because there was a tremendous need, obviously, for <span class="building">factory</span> workers because German males were in the army. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And because of the fact that many of these women worked, there was a need for <span class="building">day care centers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1682">So Margot pretended to work in one of those. </sentence><sentence id="1683">But that alone, to have a job, a credible job wasn't really enough. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I  3 mean, the thing is that <span class="populated place">village</span> where we lived was about three to four miles away from the nearest <span class="building">commuter station</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and people either bicycled from the <span class="populated place">village</span> and parked their <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> then at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, there were <span class="spatial object">bicycle racks</span>, or they took a <span class="spatial object">postal bus</span> that sort of went down the <span class="dlf">country road</span> which the <span class="populated place">village</span> was at certain schedules, I forgot what it was, but not very frequently, I think once an hour or so. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And now I went into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> actually twice a week to maintain contact with <span class="building">black market</span> sources to obtain food and so I made it a point then always to take the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and people saw me at the <span class="dlf">bus stop</span> and, of course, I pretended to go to work to my <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1686">On other days when I did not go there, since it was also known that I had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I would bicycle around the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, I simply sort of spread the word that whenever I had a chance, I liked to <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, I would take the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> to that commuter <span class="building">line station</span> and park it there so that people wouldn't wonder why I wasn't there regularly. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I forgot what Margot's father's alibi was, he and his wife also went into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> twice a week to catch up with their and keep contact with their <span class="building">black market</span> sources. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Margot herself was, number one, the most Jewish looking of the four of us and on top of it, she was at that time always extremely nervous and afraid, and so she stayed out there and never went into the <span class="populated place">city</span> and that created somewhat of a problem, but what she had to do was to stay inside the <span class="building">house</span>, I mean people didn't check up really literally, and she just stayed inside the <span class="building">house</span> all day and only appeared outside after, I don't know, five or six when people normally would be <span class="building">home</span> from their jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1689">Another very important issue was that of police registration. </sentence><sentence id="1690">In <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time, and I believe even today still, every person has to be registered with the police at his or her <span class="building">place of residence</span> and a person can only have one place of <span class="building">residence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Now, all the people out there who lived in these <span class="building">houses</span>, in these  4 <span class="building">cottages</span>, some were as primitive as ours, others may have been a little bit more fancy, they actually had <span class="interior space">apartments</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> where they were registered with the police and they moved out there because just about the time when we went <span class="interior space">underground</span>, air raids increased tremendously, particularly the American air force which was stationed at <span class="dlf">air fields</span> in, on the <span class="region">British Islands</span> and would regularly attack <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Later on, actually, on a daily basis, in early "43 it wasn't that frequent, but still frequent enough for people to be scared. </sentence><sentence id="1693">So, therefore, people preferred the safety of some <span class="populated place">village</span> which surely wouldn't be bombed, to being in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and being trapped in an <span class="building">apartment building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1694">But that, of course, posed a problem for them because, as I said, by law everybody has to be registered and a person can only be registered at one place with the police. </sentence><sentence id="1695">So if these people would have to, so if you, if a person moved there was actually also a de-registration form. </sentence><sentence id="1696">The person had to de-register at his or her old <span class="building">residence</span> and then the person actually received a copy of the de-registration form to present at the new place where the person would then register. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Well, if the people would have done that, would have de-registered in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they would immediately have lost their <span class="interior space">apartments</span> since as a result of the air raids many people lost their <span class="interior space">apartments</span> and there was practically no new <span class="building">building</span> going on because of wartime conditions and all of the raw material and labor were really put into the war effort to build <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, <span class="spatial object">planes</span> and whatever else was needed. </sentence><sentence id="1698">So there was an acute and increasing shortage of <span class="interior space">apartments</span>, so if somebody moved out of his <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, the first thing was that it would be snapped away by the <span class="building">housing authority</span> and the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> would be given over to some bombed out family. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And of course, people wanted to maintain their <span class="building">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">To make a long story short, the result was that all of these good Germans who lived out there, lived there essentially,  5 quote, illegally. </sentence><sentence id="1701">They did not register there because they couldn't because they didn't want to de-register and give up their <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> apartments. </sentence><sentence id="1702">The local police which was in charge of that, of course, knew about it and simply looked the other way because it was understandable, you know, people didn't want to lose their <span class="interior space">city apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And that was a perfect argument for us because we couldn't register for different reasons, we were underground Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1704">But we had that perfect argument, of course we had our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and as I mentioned earlier, the address that we gave, the fictitious, there was actually a Hermann Hesse living there, so somebody could check us out in the telephone book and we were there only for fear of the air raids. </sentence><sentence id="1705">So actually I always felt that was the first time in my life that the Americans came and helped me. </sentence><sentence id="1706">So, alright, that was, yeah, and then what we did in the beginning was, we had several sessions in that little <span class="interior space">cottage</span> where we interrogated ourselves on all of these issues, you know, I mean who I was, I was a nephew and that my parents had died while I was still a baby and I was raised by my aunt and uncle and where I worked and where they worked and so that became part of our nature, we constantly asked ourselves these questions so that nobody would ever make a slip-up or give some wrong answer or even an answer contradicting somebody or somebody else who said something. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And, alright, I should say also by the way, the date that we moved out there, I mentioned earlier was the 30th of January, 1943, was an extremely interesting date. </sentence><sentence id="1708">First of all, it was the 10th anniversary of Hitler's assumption of power, that he was named Reich Chancellor, and secondly and more important for us, it was the day on which Field Marshall Paulus, commander of German Sixth Army in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, surrendered his army in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1709">The huge battle of <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> which had raged from October through January, that means four  6 months, the Germans had lost and it was the first major military loss for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And that made us unbelievably ecstatic. </sentence><sentence id="1711">In fact, we decided that after that loss the war can't last longer than next summer, meaning the summer of "43. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I think it was that optimism that made us keep going. </sentence><sentence id="1713">We would have, if we would have known it would last another over two years, I don't know whether, what we would have, I guess we had no other choice anyway, but it kept our spirits up. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Yeah, then the food situation. </sentence><sentence id="1715">As I had mentioned earlier also, food was rationed, the ration coupons were given out to people who were registered with the police, see, the <span class="building">food rationing offices</span> had actually a duplicate of the police registration file. </sentence><sentence id="1716">So obviously, since we were not registered with the police, we couldn't get food ration cards and therefore, we had to buy all of our food on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1717">The <span class="building">black market</span> does not mean that there was actually a <span class="building">market</span> somewhere where people traded. </sentence><sentence id="1718">I mean that would have been immediately, been exploded by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1719"><span class="building">Black market</span> simply means that people were trading in rationed food, but without ration coupons. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Who were these people? </sentence><sentence id="1721">Well, they were all kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="1722">First of all, fellow underground Jews, you know for example, somebody might have had a terrific source for baked goods and breads but nothing else, but that person would then trade in breads and sell them at a profit for him and use that maybe to buy a sausage from somebody else who had that source. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And so there was, we knew of quite a <span class="dlf">circle</span> of underground Jews and so that was also a source for <span class="building">black market</span> food. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Then various sympathetic gentiles, I had for example, a <span class="building">house</span> maid of my maternal grandparents, in fact my maternal grandmother died, fortunately a natural death, only a few months before the deportations started. </sentence><sentence id="1725">And her last maid, she had been with my grandmother for many years and she was a very faithful family friend and she was the  7 last one who could afford even to buy <span class="building">black market</span> food, but she was a very modest and simple person and she claimed she didn't even need all the food that she was getting on her ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="1726">So I went there, one of the stops that I did on my <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> visits was her little <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and she always had some food, first of all she always fed me a warm meal and then she also gave me something that she had saved from her rations. </sentence><sentence id="1727">Then there was the butcher of the Hesse family, near where they lived. </sentence><sentence id="1728">Now, they were very decent people, very strongly anti-Nazi and when they told them that they were going <span class="interior space">underground</span>, they immediately promised to supply them as much as they could with meats. </sentence><sentence id="1729">But the problem was they couldn't really go there because they were known in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, they lived around the corner there from that <span class="building">butcher</span> and everybody knew them. </sentence><sentence id="1730">If they would appear there without a star, somebody would surely denounce them. </sentence><sentence id="1731">So before we actually went <span class="interior space">underground</span>, I was introduced to them and as I had mentioned earlier, we had lived, our family lived in a totally different part of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So not a soul knew me there. </sentence><sentence id="1733">So I was introduced, and there was also a ruse agreed upon how I would go about getting food from her. </sentence><sentence id="1734">But people were very jealous in those days and so I would come into the <span class="building">store</span> and say to her that my mother was in here this morning and left an order for sausage and meat and gave you already the food stamps and she would say yes, that's right, I have your order ready. </sentence><sentence id="1735">Then she would go in the <span class="interior space">back</span> and pack us whatever she felt like up and charged me just the regular amount of money for these items, which were all under price control. </sentence><sentence id="1736">She could have, I should have said earlier, on the <span class="building">black market</span> roughly the price of food was 10 times the regular price control price, it varied a little bit, it also depend on what kind of food, but that was a good average. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And she could have made a lot of money with that, instead she sold it to me  8 exactly at the price that was under price control and that was also purely, I mean, out of support. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And then another important item, incidentally, which people never think about, is shoe repair. </sentence><sentence id="1739">Not only were shoes rationed, but shoe repair was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="1740">In other words, if you needed a new sole, there was a ration coupon that you had to hand in for a sole for a shoe and we didn't have that. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Well, here our old shoemaker from our <span class="region">area</span> had agreed to support us and the thing was, he was actually a secret communist and, of course, he was not active in the underground communist party, but he had been a communist earlier and maintained his sympathies. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And his <span class="building">shoe shop</span> was not as close to our old <span class="interior space">apartment</span> as that <span class="building">butcher</span> was to the <span class="populated place">Hesse</span>'s <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, so I could go there without fearing to run into anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1743">So we had all our shoe repairs and that was, in the long run, that was as much a life saver as food. </sentence><sentence id="1744">What are you going to do if your shoes fall apart, you can't get new shoes, you can't repair them, that basically condemns you to stay at <span class="building">home</span>, so we solved that problem with him. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And then we had various other, I mean there was a whole bunch of people who we relied on to obtain food and for the money, as I said, we paid, I used the money gradually that I obtained from the assets of my father that I talked about earlier. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1851">Q: Let me ask you a question here. </sentence><sentence id="1852">Was there any difficulty in figuring out which people you could trust or not trust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1855">A: No, I mean the difficulty might have been in somebody whom I ran across sort of unexpectedly somewhere, but the people that we had sort of contact with, we knew we could trust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1857">Q: What about people you ran across, like old family friends? </sentence><sentence id="1858"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1859">A: Yeah, I mean, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was a <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time still close to five million people, in a sense even though <span class="populated place">New York</span> is much bigger, it is also similar in the sense that you don't tun into people. </sentence><sentence id="1860">Yeah, and of course, one thing, we had to be very careful where we went. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I mean, I never went into our old <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and they never went into theirs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1865">And also then there were certain <span class="region">areas</span>, I'll discuss that a little bit later, where sort of Jews were sort of quote, known to be often and we tried to avoid these <span class="region">areas</span> also. </sentence><sentence id="1866">But there is a possibility, I mean there was a possibility and you didn't trust anyone at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1869">Q: What about in this <span class="populated place">village</span> where you were living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1871">A: Yeah, okay, in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, okay, that was a, I sort of said already how we concocted our story there and we decided from the beginning then to just act like normal neighbors and anything else would have been impossible anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1872">So we actually started a whole social life there, we met people and, you know, invited each other, we were invited, we invited people for, I don't know, a game of cards or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1873">The most interesting person actually we met, was the local Nazi party chieftain for that <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1874">He, I mean Margot's father, was a very good accordion player and he played often and I guess in those <span class="building">cottages</span> the <span class="dlf">walls</span> are thin anyway, somehow that became known that he plays the accordion and that Nazi, his name was Harry Gladenik, a very nice charming fellow, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1875">In spite of the fact that he was a rabid Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1876">He came over and said he heard that here someone plays the accordion and he loves accordion music and they have actually every Saturday evening, a party at his <span class="building">house</span> with dancing and so on and why don't we come over sort of sometime and participate in that. </sentence><sentence id="1877">So we were frequent guests then at the <span class="building">home</span> of that Nazi, dancing with some of the women there and what was for me most important, more important than the dancing at least, was the food. </sentence><sentence id="1878">They had what  0 seemed to me limitless supplies of food there, I don't know what their sources were, but part of the source, in fact, was the sister of Harry Gladenik, that Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1879">She lived with them, but her husband who was also a real professional Nazi ideologue, was an official in the German occupation of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and had his ways of obtaining meat and sausages and all kinds of other goodies that were, even for good Germans, hard to get in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And he sent regular packages and so that was all served there and we always enjoyed going there and had a wonderful time with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1891">Q: And when you went to these <span class="building">parties</span> you felt comfortable? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1893">A: Yeah, totally, I totally sort of divorced myself from my real self and chatted with them and later on I think I felt sort of elation that, you know, that I was able to put up such a front and, I mean this whole, in the beginning I changed, in the later part of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1894">In the beginning this whole life of deception sort of had some tremendous attraction for me, now it sounds almost childish, but I felt somewhat like a secret agent in <span class="region">enemy territory</span>, trying to pretend something that wasn't the case and fooling all of the enemies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1897">Q: But there certainly is an element of risk there. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1901">A: What element of risk was there anyway? </sentence><sentence id="1902">I mean, but I mean after having lived by that time, a year and a half before we went <span class="interior space">underground</span> with the threat of deportation, which was a constant risk and something that was out of my control even. </sentence><sentence id="1903">I felt like a free person there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1907">Q: Did anybody there know of your situation other than the person whose <span class="building">house</span> it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1909">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Yeah, and she wasn't really known too well. </sentence><sentence id="1911">She had just bought it a year before and was a few times, so yeah, she obviously knew us, but no, nobody else knew us. </sentence><sentence id="1912"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1913">Q: During this period, were you in contact with other Jewish people who had gone <span class="interior space">underground</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1914">A: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="1915">There was one fellow actually, he was an interesting fellow, unfortunately I lost contact with him after the war, his name was Heinz Jacobius. </sentence><sentence id="1916">He was the most versatile person, underground Jew, that I encountered. </sentence><sentence id="1917">He lived in the middle of the <span class="populated place">city</span> with an Aryan girlfriend and of course, he also was not registered and in the <span class="populated place">city</span> it was even more complicated than in the <span class="country">country</span> where we were because the janitors of <span class="building">buildings</span> sort of had, they were legally obligated to see to it that every tenant was registered with the police. </sentence><sentence id="1918">In fact, he had to countersign the registration form that one had to fill out. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And if somebody, you know, regularly comes by, the janitor is supposed to watch out so they were somewhat like spies also, they're supposed to notice that and report that person. </sentence><sentence id="1920">But that Heinz Jacobius, he was a tremendous <span class="building">black market</span> artist and he just fed that janitor so well that he surely had no interest in killing the goose that laid his golden eggs. </sentence><sentence id="1921">Yeah, and actually he was, and then his <span class="building">house</span> was hit by incendiary bombs during an air raid. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And, of course, that scared him because if that <span class="building">house</span> would have burned down, then you know, that would have sort of destroyed the whole arrangement. </sentence><sentence id="1923">And during wartime, incidentally, the <span class="building">fire department</span>, and that was made known also, did never, never did anything to protect or put out fires in ordinary <span class="building">apartment houses</span> because they were needed for more important <span class="spatial object">objects</span>, you know, either government or <span class="building">military installations</span> and so on and so the whole population had been trained in extinguishing fires. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And he apparently distinguished himself, went out of his way in I don't know, whatever he did, that anyway, the local party organization gave him  2 a special sort of order of merit that people got for going out of their way and beyond the call of duty in putting out the fire, which they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1936">Q: The reason I asked you about your knowledge of other Jews who had gone <span class="interior space">underground</span> is, I was wondering whether there was any sort of informal network for information purposes, for any sort of political or sabotage purposes or anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1938">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I mean, there was what you might call an informal network. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I knew some and then others knew some others, but it had nothing to do, in other words, with any attempt even at sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="1941">We were totally devoted to only surviving and not being caught. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I mean sabotage would have endangered us even more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1948">Q: But what about access to information? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1950">A: Yeah, well that's what that served, but on the other hand, you had to be very careful if you, I'm coming to something that I haven't mentioned yet, but the Gestapo employed a number of Jewish spies and if you met a Jew whom you had not seen sort of on a more or less continuous basis, you didn't know whether that person was legitimately underground, like I was, or whether that was a spy working for the Gestapo and ready to hand me over. </sentence><sentence id="1951">So, for that reason, one, the unwritten law was, first of all you did not disclose to anyone where you lived. </sentence><sentence id="1952">And secondly, if you met somebody, say just on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, from earlier times, you would try to avoid that person. </sentence><sentence id="1953">End of side one of tape four. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1958">Q: This is tape four, side B of an interview with Ernest Fontheim. </sentence><sentence id="1959">It is March 13, 1997. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1962">The interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1963">A: Another important aspect of our stay there was the total change in lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="1964">I mean, I was even in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where we were forced into in the <span class="building">Jewish house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1965">It was still,  3 you know, we had running water, we had running <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, water <span class="spatial object">toilets</span>, even running hot water, central heating and all these amenities. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And suddenly from one day to the next, transformed, transferred into that primitive <span class="building">cottage</span>, was a tremendous, I don't know if culture shock as far as the wrong word, sort of a living style shock would be probably better. </sentence><sentence id="1967">We had to, as I said, get our water from a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> outside and we learned that if it freezes, then the <span class="spatial object">pump</span> freezes and you had to do all kinds of shenanigans to unfreeze the <span class="spatial object">pump</span>, like pouring hot water through a <span class="dlf">priming hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1968">We had, of course obviously, no <span class="spatial object">water toilet</span>, but an <span class="building">outhouse</span> which was very primitive and in winter very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And, as I also said, there was of course no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="1970">We had, for a lot of money we had to buy petroleum on the <span class="building">black market</span> to run the one <span class="spatial object">petroleum lamp</span> and also had candles for which we had to pay a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And so it was a total change in lifestyle and I found that at the time, very romantic and felt that living in a big <span class="building">city apartment house</span> with running water and central heating made us only degenerate and now at least these horrible times had one advantage, they make us sort of return to <span class="env feature">nature</span> and so that we really appreciate what is heat. </sentence><sentence id="1972">Heat is not just some <span class="dlf">pipes</span> that radiate heat, but in our case, wood had to be cut with an <span class="spatial object">ax</span> and was hard work and that's how you create your heat. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And water had to be obtained from a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> and sometimes you had to unfreeze it and I remember at that time I was very romantic about all of this and thought that was a great thing that was happening to me that I was returning to <span class="env feature">nature</span> in some form. </sentence><sentence id="1974">Okay, yeah, I had mentioned earlier also, these so-called black accounts that my father had with various people. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Now it turned out that the <span class="building">black market</span> prices were continuously increasing, there was an inflation even in the <span class="building">black market</span> and so I was aware of the fact, you know, a fixed sum of money sort of would shrink in purchasing power over the years  4 and I wanted to avoid that. </sentence><sentence id="1976">So, the money which I had with that former client <span class="building">furrier</span>, client of my father, I decided to invest in something that would keep its value at least for, or would increase with inflation, thereby keeping its purchasing power. </sentence><sentence id="1977">And through a friend I had the opportunity to buy a women's sort of evening handbag made out of sort of high carat gold and platinum, little elements sort of like in a chain. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And for that <span class="spatial object">handbag</span> I paid twelve thousand Reichsmark and then I gave it back to the <span class="building">furrier</span> because I didn't want to have it for fear, you know, something happens and so he kept it. </sentence><sentence id="1979">But he also offered me to do some work on his <span class="dlf">estate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1980">He had a fantastic <span class="dlf">estate</span> outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, east of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in a very fancy <span class="region">area</span> with big <span class="building">mansions</span> and he said he needed anyway some workers and if I came, he would feed me for that day and pay me also and in addition, he also dealt on a large scale in <span class="building">black market</span>, there would be always some things that he could give me along. </sentence><sentence id="1981">So once a week, I went out to his estate. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Now on that <span class="populated place">estate</span>, he had actually three workers already. </sentence><sentence id="1983">One was a Polish couple, they were real peasants and in fact he detailed me sort of to that Polish guy and he told me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And his wife was | think sort of a cleaning woman in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1985">And then he had a single Polish girl, a young woman, her name was Maria and she was the cook and also sort of homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="1986">And incidentally, I have to add that he had all these workers was only a result of his connections. </sentence><sentence id="1987">As I said earlier, he supplied <span class="populated place">Goring</span> with furs, because according to the law at that time, forced foreign laborers could be used only in either agriculture or <span class="building">defense plants</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And agriculture meant not for the people, you know, people for their own <span class="interior space">back yards</span> as he did, but agriculture in the sense these were suppliers of food for the population. </sentence><sentence id="1989">So he was legally not entitled to them but had them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1990">But I mean the German, the system under the Nazis was shot through with  5 corruption and anyone could get anything he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1991">I mean, incidentally, the film Schindler's List is an excellent example how Schindler, even in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> with a number of diamonds, gets his workers out of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1992">So I went, as I said, I went there once a week and worked under the supervision of that Polish peasant and that peasant, he talked German haltingly but fairly well, and he was obsessed because he was a great Polish patriot and he was obsessed with, I mean with the terrible fate of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1993">And in his theory, the cause for the terrible fate of <span class="country">Poland</span>, it had two causes. </sentence><sentence id="1994">One was the communists or the Soviets and the other one was the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1995">The Germans, for some reason, never occurred to him, even though they were the ones to attack <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1996">And so I had to listen to his antisemitic tirades and sort of appear to agree with him. </sentence><sentence id="1997">And another aspect, there was that Maria, the maid, every time when I was ready to leave, she called me to her <span class="interior space">room</span> to give me some food and also something to eat right there and something to take along. </sentence><sentence id="1998">And I was convinced that she must sort of be secretly in love with me, but I didn't want to have anything to do with her, I mean for many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1999">First of all, I wasn't attracted to her and secondly, I felt any involvement of that kind can only be dangerous. - </sentence><sentence id="2000">One of the other underground friends, we had a whole circle of people who were underground, not a circle in the sense that we actually lived together, but we kept in touch with each other, and one of them was a fellow from my <span class="building">high school</span> graduating class. </sentence><sentence id="2001">His name was Gerd Cohn. </sentence><sentence id="2002">He lived also with a non-Jewish girlfriend and he had all kinds of contacts also for <span class="building">black market</span> foods and necessities. </sentence><sentence id="2003">And one day he told me that he met a group of foreign forced laborers who were a tremendous source of <span class="building">black market</span> food. </sentence><sentence id="2004">And in fact, there was a plan somewhere to illegally slaughter a <span class="spatial object">pig</span> and sell it off right away. </sentence><sentence id="2005">And he asked me, he had to, he was going there, he had to commit  6 himself, however, to a given amount of pounds of meat and I discussed it at <span class="building">home</span> and I gave him a certain order, I forgot what it was, X number of pounds and, incidentally, the listener will from that, I guess, gather that I don't eat kosher which is true. </sentence><sentence id="2006">I never did eat kosher and actually I always enjoyed ham, but at that point we didn't even have the luxury of being very choosy. </sentence><sentence id="2007">Anyway to make a long story short, on the day, on the appointed day when I was supposed to come to pick up the meat, his girlfriend was in hysterics. </sentence><sentence id="2008">He didn't come back, and the next day he didn't come back either. </sentence><sentence id="2009">And of course, there was no way, where do you go to find out? </sentence><sentence id="2010">Now, this under, other underground Jewish friend of mine whom I had mentioned earlier, Heinz Jacobius, who you know also did all kinds of things in the underground, he even, he had some sort of a <span class="dlf">line</span>, I didn't know what it was, to the Gestapo where he could find out things and I asked him to make some inquiries whether this Gerd Cohn ever appeared. </sentence><sentence id="2011">The thing is here, all Jews who were arrested for deportation ultimately wound up in the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2012">And he made those inquiries and there was no Gerd Cohn ever appeared there. </sentence><sentence id="2013">So it was clear that he must have been the victim of a crime and there was actually a German newspaper article that, about two weeks later or so, that a torso with the head missing and the hands missing and these would be the identifiers, the hands, because of fingerprints and obviously the head because of the facial features, was found floating in the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2014">Oh yeah, and it was, the article mentioned a certain scar, I forgot from some operation, and friends of his knew that he had such a scar. </sentence><sentence id="2015">So apparently, he must have had some horrible fate and the suspicion was that these foreign laborers, apparently you know, he had first of all, a large amount of money with him to purchase that large amount of meat that he had ordered, and in addition to that, he had some excellent forged ID which could  7 always be re-forged into a different name or a different picture, and maybe other things that were of value to those guys, so the opinion among people who knew him and the circumstances was that he was, that this was a trap, there never was a pig and that he was murdered. </sentence><sentence id="2016">That he was lured into that trap and lost his life that way, a horrible fate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2071">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Since you have mentioned a few minutes ago that most people who were arrested went initially to the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2075">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2077">Q: Were there random crimes or murders by the SS or against Jews, or was it all done very, in an organized fashion for deportation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2079">A: No, actually, no that's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="2080">The Germans somehow abhor sort of random violence. </sentence><sentence id="2081">In fact the Kristallnacht even, which was a case of random violence, was criticized within the Nazi circles very much and in fact actually, at a ministerial meeting, a cabinet meeting two days afterwards, <span class="populated place">Goring</span> severely criticized, I think Goebbels was mainly behind that, because of all the destruction. </sentence><sentence id="2082">It turned out that the kind of glass that is used for <span class="dlf">shop windows</span> was, at that time was a glass that was not even made in <span class="country">Germany</span>, they had to buy it in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, that means they had to use foreign exchange and then Gering turned to Goebbels and said, you could have, it would have been better if you would have killed a few more hundred Jews rather than cause all of that destruction which now we have to, you know, so they are, anyway to come back specifically to your question, that process was very orderly. </sentence><sentence id="2083">The Jew was arrested, he was put into that <span class="populated place">camp</span> until enough people were together to put together a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and then they were shipped off. </sentence><sentence id="2084">I mean, they may have been beaten up maybe in some sadistic urge by some SS men, but...  8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2085">Q: But this isn't like in <span class="populated place">camps</span> or in <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> where if you said something wrong you could have been shot? </sentence><sentence id="2086">This didn't really happen in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I mean, if you did something wrong, yeah, I mean, they had a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> there which was a sort of a nickname for a part of the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, I think it was only four feet high and only a few square feet, people were put in as punishment. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Particularly if there were escape attempts, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2090">But they were not shot sort of randomly like you saw in the film Schindler's List, that was not, they were always shipped for orderly killing. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Let me see, yeah, I had mentioned already that if one met some Jewish person in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> whom one hadn't seen for a long time, the initial reaction was always to be suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2092">I'm coming now probably to the saddest chapter of the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, and these are the Jewish catchers or spies. </sentence><sentence id="2093">The Gestapo kept a sort of a small herd of them and they operated also out of the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2094">Incidentally, the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> had shifted in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="2095">It was no longer in the <span class="building">old age home</span>, I think the <span class="building">old age home</span> was then used for other governmental purposes. </sentence><sentence id="2096">The <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> was shifted to the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, which was then the last place, I mean sort of Jewish owned <span class="building">building</span> in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2097">And a part of, one <span class="interior space">wing</span> of the <span class="building">hospital</span> was turned over to the Gestapo to maintain the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And the spies also had their <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> and they lived there, but they could come and go as they wanted, of course, and more importantly, they obviously didn't wear the yellow star as they normally would have had to. </sentence><sentence id="2099">And their task was to track down Jews, other Jews who were <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2100">And the sad story is that first of all, they were incredibly more effective than the Gestapo because the Gestapo basically in tracking down a Jew, was sort of like a blind person trying to find something, they had really nothing to go by. </sentence><sentence id="2101">While the spies, all of them had  9 themselves been underground and had then been caught and they knew many of the tricks and trades of underground Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2102">They knew where to go to and so on and they had a much better nose, plus many of them, of course, knew other underground Jews anyway and would just give those names to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2103">Now the most notorious of these was a woman, her maiden name was Stella Goldschlag, and unfortunately, I knew her fairly well. </sentence><sentence id="2104">She worked part of the time that I was at <span class="building">Siemens</span>, she also worked for <span class="building">Siemens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2105">At that time, she was married to a man whose last name was Kiibler, so then her name was Stella Kiibler. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Stella was a strikingly beautiful woman, she was tall, slender, had long golden blond locks, wavy hair and blue eyes and a very pretty face. </sentence><sentence id="2107">She, at <span class="building">Siemens</span> also, she was sort of the center of attention. </sentence><sentence id="2108">I came to know her, even though she was not in my <span class="building">department</span> but in a different one, in fact she was in the same <span class="building">department</span> where some members of the Baum group, this underground Jewish communist group, were working that I had mentioned earlier. </sentence><sentence id="2109">But, in my class in the <span class="building">orthodox school</span> that I went to in the "30's was a boy named Klaus Goldschlag, in fact I remembered him very well, he was the top student in our class. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And I know he left and emigrated to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2111">And Goldschlag is not exactly a common name, so when I met her first, I asked her whether she is related to him and then she said, yeah, that's her cousin, and so we talked several times about him and then also sometimes about other things. </sentence><sentence id="2112">But otherwise, I had not much in common with her, I don't think she had any, to my knowledge, any intellectual interests or music interests and the circles that I sort of circulated in, she surely did not belong to. </sentence><sentence id="2113">But, through the <span class="spatial object">mouth radio</span>, sometime in the, maybe mid-"43, I heard that she is working for the Gestapo as a catcher and that really scared me. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And in fact, I know that at one point, I almost encountered her. </sentence><sentence id="2115">What happened was the following thing. </sentence><sentence id="2116"> 00 Even in walking around in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I developed various strategies to avoid being recognized and one was, in a big <span class="populated place">city</span> of course, there is a lot of pedestrian traffic, you know, people walking this way, people walking that way, and when I walked down a <span class="dlf">street</span>, I would look at the faces of the people, not who would just be in front of me, but three or four people down behind them, so that I would, could possibly recognize others before I was recognized by them. </sentence><sentence id="2117">That was one, the other strategy was that I always had a handkerchief at hand and if some real emergency arose, I would pretend to have to blow my nose, but in such a way that I covered most of my face with my handkerchief and wouldn't be recognizable that way. </sentence><sentence id="2118">So one day I was walking down a <span class="dlf">street</span>, I even remember the name, <span class="dlf">Pfalzburger Strasse</span>, and I saw, again looking back several people beyond the one that immediately faced me and I saw what seemed to be Stella. </sentence><sentence id="2119">I couldn't 100% identify her, but I, obviously I didn't want to take a chance, you know, to get closer to her. </sentence><sentence id="2120">I immediately decided turning around and running away would be the worst thing to do and I was lucky, just at that point where I recognized her, I passed a <span class="building">store</span>, so I just went into the <span class="building">store</span> pretending, I remember it was a <span class="building">green grocer</span>, so he had potatoes, vegetables, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And I turned my back to the <span class="dlf">window</span> and pretending to look at various items in the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2122">For awhile the saleswoman or probably the owner, already asked me what I wanted and I said, well, I just want to see what you have and so on and then after quite a while, after she must have long passed, I sort of excused myself and looked out and she was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I mean, there has been a book written about her and she has really caused the death of many people. </sentence><sentence id="2124">Now, she was after the war then tried in a <span class="building">German court</span>, well first she was tried by the Russians who everybody hoped would just finish her off, instead they gave her just a 10-year sentence from "46 to "56. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Then she  01 reappeared and then there was an unbelievable clamor that for her to be put away. </sentence><sentence id="2126">And then the Germans meticulously said, well, a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice, but there were in the meantime, many other arrests that she made which had not been covered by the Soviet trial and so she was then tried for those cases and then she was found guilty and the judge gave her another 10 years, but applying the 10 years that she already served under the Soviets, she was immediately set free. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And it is known that she lives now under an assumed name somewhere in <span class="region">West Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2128">That is something, that is some of the worst, she should have been done away with, preferably hanged immediately after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2129">Supposedly after some research that other people did, she is guilty of hundreds of lives that she gave over to the Gestapo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2173">Q: Let me ask you a few questions here. </sentence><sentence id="2174">Were you, do you think that while you were working together at <span class="building">Siemens</span> that she was involved in this kind of activity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2177">A: No, not at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2179">Q: It was later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2181">A: It was later, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2183">Q: What sorts of stories did you hear at the time about what she was doing? </sentence><sentence id="2184">What kinds of things was she doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2187">A: Well, I mean, what she was doing was to walk around <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and she knew where Jews were likely to go and, for example, it became known that a very safe place was, of all places, the <span class="building">Berlin State Opera</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And the Gestapo would never bother with that and most Jews, they were music lovers, so you could have a pleasant evening even, listening to good music and be safe. </sentence><sentence id="2189">The problem was that Stella knew that, too. </sentence><sentence id="2190">So she appeared there one day and arrested a whole family of, a sort of middle aged couple and a teenage  02 son or something. </sentence><sentence id="2191">You know, that was exactly the, and she would pull, she had a small revolver that she would pull on people if they didn't exactly, and then one person tried to run away and she shouted, stop him, it's a Jew, and there were some men that grabbed that person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2197">Q: You knew her a little bit, what motivated her to do such evil things? </sentence><sentence id="2198">What was it about her, what was she like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2201">A: What was about her was self preservation, I mean that's how she survived the war, I mean by having others killed. </sentence><sentence id="2202">Now, she claimed after the war also that she did it mainly to protect her parents. </sentence><sentence id="2203">Yeah, well, she had a bargain initially with the Gestapo and SS official who commanded that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And the bargain was that her parents could stay also, they got a <span class="interior space">room</span> there and they could stay there with her, she was an only child. </sentence><sentence id="2205">And then at some point, I forgot when that was, I think late "43 or maybe early "44, the Gestapo told her that they can't protect the parents any longer and then she managed to have them transported to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>, that was the only, instead of to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but they were then transferred later to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2206">I mean, the parents are sort of a tragic thing, they can't be blamed for what the daughter did, but she maintained her own life that way by killing others. </sentence><sentence id="2207">Now, there were many other people, a good friend of mine, Ismar Reich, who was <span class="interior space">underground</span> and was caught. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And he was immediately offered freedom if he could name some others and he simply refused. </sentence><sentence id="2209">And he said he wasn't even beaten, I mean he refused, fine, you don't want to, fine, you go to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2210">Now, he was a very clever resourceful guy. </sentence><sentence id="2211">He was with some friends there and somehow they succeeded in smuggling some tools with them and then while the <span class="spatial object">train</span> rolled, they started to saw, you know, they, these <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span> are basically <span class="dlf">wooden siding</span>, they sawed some  03 planks off and when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> slowed down somewhere they jumped out and saved themselves that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2223">Q: Were there a great number of these <span class="spatial object">catchers</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2225">A: I mean, too many probably. </sentence><sentence id="2226">I don't know how many, but maybe 10, 15 or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2229">Q: But you knew of others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2231">A: Yeah, oh yeah, there were others, too. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Maybe this is a point where I might indicate an incident that we had. </sentence><sentence id="2233">We decided that in the long run it may not be safe if we stay just at that one point all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2234">So we decided we ought to look for a sort of substitute place in case we have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2235">So I contacted, I'm not sure whether I mentioned that, or maybe I did, my father's, one of his clients were members of the Hohenzollern family, it was actually the sister-in-law of the last German Kaiser and her son and they had an <span class="dlf">estate</span> sort of half way <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, between <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and <span class="populated place">Potsdam</span>, a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> which used to be the summer residence of Prussian kings. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And she was, they were very good friends of our family and we made an appointment and Margot, her mother and I went there and discussed and I knew, apparently, something that she had separate <span class="interior space">servants quarters</span> somewhere and I discussed with her, you know, the possibility whether there might be some place for us to spend maybe not long periods, but maybe a week or so at a time. </sentence><sentence id="2237">And it was somewhat inconclusive and so on, I mean she also had to be careful, obviously, so on the way back from there, that <span class="dlf">estate</span> was off a sort of a <span class="dlf">country road</span> connecting <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and <span class="populated place">Potsdam</span> and where a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> only came, I don't know, once every hour, if that much. </sentence><sentence id="2238">And we decided, we knew when the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> was coming and that maybe there was another half hour left or so and there was a little <span class="building">country inn</span> and we did have also illegally obtained ration coupons, so why don't we go in and maybe have a piece of  04 cake and a cup of coffee and talk there. </sentence><sentence id="2239">So we went in and Margot's mother immediately, there was a <span class="dlf">revolving door</span> I remember, you know you go through the <span class="dlf">revolving door</span> and then you walk in. </sentence><sentence id="2240">She instead of walking in, right away revolved back out and, you know, that immediately rang a bell. </sentence><sentence id="2241">So I didn't ask any questions and Margot not either. </sentence><sentence id="2242">We immediately revolved out and then the mother said that there was a couple sitting that she knew, they are Jews, she don't know, she doesn't know, you know, what their background, who they are, but one has to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="2243">So we walked out and then walked along and decided maybe to walk to the next <span class="building">bus stop</span> in order not to wait right in front there. </sentence><sentence id="2244">And as we walked, and we walked fairly briskly, we heard sort of footsteps coming from behind, closing in, and it was the man. </sentence><sentence id="2245">And he said, he saw us come in and he had the impression maybe we were afraid of him, but there was no reason, we shouldn't be afraid, he is himself in hiding and we should just feel free to come in. </sentence><sentence id="2246">That of course, was a giveaway already. </sentence><sentence id="2247">No Jew at that time would have told somebody else whom he hadn't known, like he didn't even know me, you know, that he was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2248">He should have been mistrustful of me as I would have been of him. </sentence><sentence id="2249">Anyway, he sort of implored us to come back and we just refused and as an excuse we gave that we discovered that we are actually late, we have to get back to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to meet somebody or some excuse like that and we were walking to the next <span class="dlf">bus stop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2250">Yeah, and the man then gave up and returned to the <span class="building">restaurant</span> where there was actually the previous <span class="dlf">bus stop</span> was there and we were hurrying up because it was already getting the time for the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to come and we were still some distance away from the next <span class="dlf">bus stop</span> when we saw the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> coming and so we sort of speeded up but never made it. </sentence><sentence id="2251">But as the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> passed us, in those days <span class="spatial object">busses</span> were not closed, where you entered it was sort of open and there was  05 an open <span class="dlf">platform</span> at the back. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And as the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> passed us, we saw that man standing in that <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2253">So then it was obvious that he was trying to follow us and was trying to take the same <span class="spatial object">bus</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="2254">So we were glad we didn't make it to the next <span class="dlf">stop</span>, instead after the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> had cleared there, we walked off the, this <span class="dlf">country road</span> and there was a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2255">Now, I had the basic map of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> fairly well in my head, we didn't have a map along because it didn't occur to us that we needed one. </sentence><sentence id="2256">But I knew that in the direction if we walked, that was walking east from there, just through <span class="env feature">forests</span>, | mean it may have been several miles, we would come to a suburban sort of <span class="dlf">commuter line</span> where we could catch a <span class="spatial object">train</span> because we were sure that if we would take the next <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, he would have alerted police at the next <span class="building">suburban station</span> for that <span class="dlf">line</span> which was actually <span class="populated place">Wannsee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2257">And so that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2258">We walked for hours through the <span class="env feature">forest</span> roughly sort of keeping in the direction until we came to that <span class="dlf">suburban line</span> which was a totally different <span class="dlf">line</span> and there we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and got back. </sentence><sentence id="2259">But such incidents, I mean of that kind, happened fairly frequently. </sentence><sentence id="2260">Another incident that just occurred to me now, was, for heating our <span class="spatial object">stove</span> of course, we bought firewood which was expensive and even some coal and in addition to that, I went and collected sort of dead wood branches from the <span class="env feature">forest</span> around that <span class="populated place">village</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And for that, even for that one needed a official permission of the <span class="building">Forestry Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2262">I still have that, it's sort of almost like a joke, it permits the bearer, Giinther Hesse, that was my name then, to collect dead branches that are lying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2263">But of course, I didn't confine myself to dead <span class="env feature">branches</span>, I often just broke off live <span class="env feature">branches</span> and even small <span class="env feature">trees</span> and we would then sort of hack them into pieces and let them dry out before using them in our <span class="spatial object">oven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2264">The problem was that I was once observed by the forester and but he didn't stop me, I never saw him even and he didn't stop me and so I didn't know that I was  06 observed. </sentence><sentence id="2265">But one of the settlers in our <span class="populated place">settlement</span> was a good friend of his and he, and the forester told him that he noticed that I was violating the law and taking live branches and he would have to report me. </sentence><sentence id="2266">Now basically, that was probably a, you know, a kind of offense was a little fine, but the problem was if it was reported, I didn't exist legally and that would have immediately endangered our existence there. </sentence><sentence id="2267">So, but we had a tremendous source for cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="2268">Cigarettes were of course rationed. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Margot's father was a chain smoker and so he spent a lot of his money on cigarettes and he went to that other settler and told him again a lie story, I mean the story was that if 1 got fined for that, then my military exemption will immediately be taken away from me and I will be shipped to the <span class="region">eastern front</span> and by that time the <span class="region">eastern front</span> was by everyone considered sort of like a death sentence and people had sort of understanding for that. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And if he can do something about it, you know, we will supply the necessary cartons of cigarettes and the forester had a certain price, I forgot what it was, several cartons, and of course, the guy had to get his cut, too. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And in this way we avoided that I was, you know, cited for that offense of taking live <span class="dlf">branches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2272">Then another incident occurred once in splitting wood with our <span class="spatial object">ax</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2273">We didn't really have a proper <span class="dlf">base</span> for splitting wood, but just sort of a relatively soft wood stump and once when I sort of apparently hit the wood that I wanted to split particularly hard, I split not only the wood but also the stump and the <span class="spatial object">ax</span> went right into my foot at my ankle. </sentence><sentence id="2274">And there was a really big open wound which obviously, first of all, needed to be sewn up and secondly also, probably my bone would have to be x-rayed in case the bone was damaged. </sentence><sentence id="2275">So one of the neighbors who had a <span class="spatial object">car</span> drove me to the nearest <span class="building">hospital</span> and then there was, of course, first we are afraid if they say I have  07 to stay overnight then again, there was a need for identification and so on, so I was x-rayed and fortunately, they discovered that the bone wasn't damaged. </sentence><sentence id="2276">End of tape four. </sentence><sentence id="2277">Tape 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2325">Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Ernest Fontheim on March 13, 1997, the interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2327">A: So all that needed to be done was to sew up the wound and send me <span class="building">home</span>, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="2328">But Margot's father was with me, we were in a sort of a <span class="dlf">holding area</span> and a nurse approached with a needle and he knew something, I mean Margot's father, that I wasn't aware of, namely that after such an injury one needs a tetanus shot. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And the tetanus shot is given into a person's rear end and so he knew immediately they would ask me to lower my pants and that would surely have been a 100% give-away to anyone in <span class="country">Germany</span> who I really was, once they would have discovered my circumcision. </sentence><sentence id="2330">So he had a quick presence of mind and I was lying on a <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span> and he turned me around on my belly and then pulled my pants off before the nurse could get to me so | got the shot into my rear end and nobody saw anything else of me. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And then I was sewn up and since <span class="building">hospitals</span> anyway were short of <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, obviously because of the large demands for wounded soldiers, they were glad that I didn't have to stay and we were glad that I didn't have to stay for different reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2332">I also want to mention a cousin of mine, he was actually the son of the couple where we stayed in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the <span class="building">Jew house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2333">He was several years older than I, he was by that time, I would guess, in his mid or late 30's, I was just 20 or 21 then, and he lived with his girlfriend, Bella Ritter. </sentence><sentence id="2334">His name was Albert Marck. </sentence><sentence id="2335">And Bella Ritter's husband had already been arrested and had been for years in a  08 <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and she lived now with my cousin and they decided to go underground in <span class="region">Bavaria</span> and he told me that before they left, that he considered <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Of course he had lived there much longer also as an adult, and they had figured out a way, apparently, that they thought was foolproof. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And that was that he had some medical sort of statements from doctors that he was suffering from some lung disease which required his recuperation in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And then he had some ID, I guess, on the name that matched it and so did his woman friend. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And we decided we wanted to keep in touch, of course, and that was a big problem because he was planning sort of to move around from different <span class="building">sanatoriums</span>, and I didn't want to give anyone my address. </sentence><sentence id="2340">So the solution was that is something that can be done in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I don't know whether that exists here, you can address a letter to somebody under a code name at general delivery at a given <span class="building">post office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2341">I still remember my code was the letter F like in <span class="populated place">Fontheim</span>, 58, F58 and at a particular <span class="building">post office</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2342">I mean that was also a risky thing because if somehow he had been found by the Gestapo with such a letter, they could have waited for me there, but I guess one did all kinds of stupid things. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So anyway, we corresponded in that way and then one day the correspondence stopped and then I got a letter from Bella, his friend, that something happened to him and he is very sick and she is returning to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> alone. </sentence><sentence id="2344">So that immediately told me that he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2345">It was a big tragedy actually because what happened she told, we met in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and she told me that he, apparently there were some questions raised at the place where they were staying, but they were still able to get away, but they left all of their assets, I mean that they had to carry with them always, certain valuables, I don't know what they were, but what they needed to sustain their life. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And he said he had to go back quickly to  09 retrieve these things and she had warned him and tried to keep him from doing it. </sentence><sentence id="2347">His point was that without the assets, how can they even continue living and she felt somehow they will make it. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Anyway, the result was that he went back and never returned. </sentence><sentence id="2349">So obviously he walked into a <span class="dlf">trap</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2350">So she was now alone in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2351">We kept in touch. </sentence><sentence id="2352">We saw each other periodically and when the time came that, she mentioned to me several times that she had a very good friend who is a jeweler and I needed some money from that <span class="building">furrier</span> where I had converted all of the money into that ladies evening handbag and so I wanted to sell it. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And she said that man gives very good prices and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2354">Anyway my first intent was not even to sell it immediately, but just to get it appraised. </sentence><sentence id="2355">So I gave the handbag to her and we were then agreed to meet the next day and she would bring the handbag back and the appraisal price from her jeweler friend. </sentence><sentence id="2356">Well, guess what, she never appeared there. </sentence><sentence id="2357">I couldn't believe that she would cheat me out of that <span class="spatial object">handbag</span>, I mean that was just incredible. </sentence><sentence id="2358">And as I found out shortly thereafter, she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2359">The problem was <span class="building">Stella Goldschlag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2360">It turned out that Stella actually transferred from <span class="building">Siemens</span> where she worked and where I had met her to a different <span class="building">factory</span> for some reason and at that <span class="building">factory</span> Bella had worked, so they knew each other. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And apparently, Bella must have run into Stella and got snatched away and she was arrested, transported to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and never came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2397">Q: Can Lask you something here? </sentence><sentence id="2398">Was a there a different feeling about being betrayed by fellow Jews than there was by being arrested and deported by the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2401">A: Totally. </sentence><sentence id="2402">I mean, as absurd as it may sound, but that's what I expected from the Gestapo to do, if they arrest me that they would deport me. </sentence><sentence id="2403">But for a Jew to do that, to turn on other Jews that was such an unbelievable act of betrayal that, I mean it just, I  10 mean if you ask any Jew who lived <span class="interior space">underground</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, whether they knew her or not, she was, everybody knew her by name at least, there is not one that I can think of who would excuse her or even say that she should have gotten anything less than execution after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2404">I mean, she just didn't deserve to live, her life is based on the lives of hundreds of people who are not alive anymore because of her. </sentence><sentence id="2405">I mean, to think of it even now still drives me crazy that she is alive and she has apparently a pleasant life and has some sort of a government pension. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Yeah, one thing, I have to back up a little bit, on the 27th of February, 1943, that was just about a little bit less than a month after we went underground, remember we went underground on the 30th of January, "43. </sentence><sentence id="2407">On the 27th of February, the SS made a general sweep of all <span class="building">factories</span> which employed Jews under extremely brutal conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2408">The 27th of February, of course, was a winter day and it was a cold day, the Gestapo simply collected the Jews without giving them the opportunity to go back to their <span class="interior space">dressing rooms</span> to pick up their outerwear, coats or whatever they had, they were just like that taken to various <span class="populated place">transit camps</span> that had been readied for that because the regular <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, obviously, wouldn't have taken the thousands and thousands of people. </sentence><sentence id="2409">And then they were shipped out in a series of <span class="spatial object">transports</span> in the first week of March, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2410">After that, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was essentially "<span class="building">judenrein</span>". </sentence><sentence id="2411">It's a tragedy because, I mean it's a tragedy for everyone, but I also have to think back again at my good friend, Hans Fabisch, who had hoped that he was safe working in a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2412">Well, he himself wasn't safe anyway, but even if he would not have been arrested on that day, it was the 18th of January, "43, he would have been arrested a little bit later and without announcement. </sentence><sentence id="2413">None of these people knew it and, incidentally, Stella Goldschlag, in that <span class="building">factory</span>, she was smart enough when the Jews were herded  11 down, apparently nobody thought of sort of bringing up the rear and she stayed back, she worked there, by the way, with her mother, she and her mother stayed back and walked slower and then ducked into one of the <span class="interior space">ladies restrooms</span> and then left at the end of the shift, at the end of the day when thousands of workers sort of streamed out of the <span class="dlf">factory gate</span> and that way they escaped being deported on that day. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And then they went <span class="interior space">underground</span> and then sometime later, she was caught, actually by another catcher for the Gestapo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2429">Q: Do you want to just, I know this is jumping forward, but because we're talking about Stella, I understand she was caught after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2430">How did that come about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2433">A: That is all explained, a book was written about her. </sentence><sentence id="2434">I mean, she wasn't caught, I mean she voluntarily went to the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to get papers as a victim of fascism and to take advantage of, you know, many of the sort of restitution measures that were then taken or given to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And she, I mean that was an unbelievable act of naivete, how she could have thought to get away with it. </sentence><sentence id="2436">I ought to say one other thing, you know there were Jews also during the years when Jews were deported and picked up, there were Jews who picked up other Jews, like my parents were picked up by Jews, that can't be compared to what Stella did. </sentence><sentence id="2437">Because these Jews picked up Jews who were not in hiding, who were basically, you might say, at the disposal of the Gestapo, I mean the Gestapo knew where they were and they could have picked them up. </sentence><sentence id="2438">It is true those Jews made life easier for the Gestapo, but nobody believes that the Gestapo would have given up the Holocaust or the murdering of the German Jews even, if these Jewish orderlies would have refused the <span class="spatial object">pickup</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2439">I know that quite a number of authors, even Raul Hilberg and particularly Hannah Arendt, have criticized very strongly the collaboration by Jews  12 in the deportation process, and not only in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but in the <span class="populated place">Eastern ghettos</span> and in other places. </sentence><sentence id="2440">However, I think each case has to be judged individually and many of these orderlies were simply not given any choice. </sentence><sentence id="2441">They had a tragic task to fulfill. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Similar, in fact, you can compare it to the so-called "Sonderkommandos", or special commandos, in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2443">These were the Jews who serviced the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and the <span class="building">crematoria</span> and extracted gold teeth from the corpses and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2444">They could have refused and would have been shot probably, and the Gestapo still would have, or the SS over there, would have obtained everything they wanted to obtain. </sentence><sentence id="2445">In the case of <span class="populated place">Stella</span>, these were people who otherwise in all likelihood, would have survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="2446">So it isa totally different thing and I want in the strongest terms, in moral terms, to make a strong difference between her actions and the actions of the orderlies who had that tragic task to pick up Jews for deportation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2447"> Beginning Tape Six, <span class="dlf">Side A</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2448">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2449">This is tape one, side A. For the record, why don't we begin again with your stating your name, date of birth and <span class="populated place">city</span> of birth, if you don't mind. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2450">A: Well, my name is, my full name is Ernest Gundolf Fontheim. </sentence><sentence id="2451">I was born on October 23, 1922, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2452">I might add that my father was a lawyer, he was born in 1881, so he was already over 40 years old when I was born and he was one of the best known lawyers in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2453">And I grew up in a -- very comfortably and in a very assimilated <span class="building">home</span>, assimilated to German culture and with very little awareness of my Judaism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2458">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2459">Do you want to pick up where we left off before? </sentence><sentence id="2460"> 13 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2461">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2462">I would -- I would like to say that the transition from -- to the life underground, underground meaning simply with forged papers and under a different identity, meant of course for me also, a radical transition in family. </sentence><sentence id="2463">My parents had just been arrested and deported and now | am living -- I was living with a completely different family and the family atmosphere was totally different. </sentence><sentence id="2464">While my parents were both actually highly educated and very intellectual, the family of Margaret and her parents, family Haas, were on the other hand -- I mean Mr. Haas was a -- a tailor and designer of women's clothes and -- and actually had owned a <span class="building">factory</span> be -- until the Nazis took it away from him. </sentence><sentence id="2465">He was a man who was much more folksy than my parents, had a tremendous sense of humor and was a very warm person. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And of course there were frictions now and then. </sentence><sentence id="2467">I guess that is always unavoidable, but in -- in general, I felt comfortable and of course also grateful that I was accepted, practically as a family member by this new family. </sentence><sentence id="2468">Also, another big difference was the age difference. </sentence><sentence id="2469">As I said, my father was actually quite old and for a boy of my age -- I mean, my mother was 10 years younger than he, but Margaret's parents were, they were both of the same age, 20 years younger than my father and 10 years younger than my mother and I think that also made a difference in -- in the relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2470">Q: What kind of difference are we talking about in terms of your rapport with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2472">A: In -- in, to some extent, in terms of rapport and then also in -- in terms of how they took life. </sentence><sentence id="2473">I mean also, I have to say that my fa -- my parents had gone through unbelievable agony, I mean starting in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Probably to some extent, they took it much harder. </sentence><sentence id="2475">They surely lost much more, because they had more to lose. </sentence><sentence id="2476">They were, in those 10 years, starting in 1933, they were robbed of all of their possessions, everything that my father had worked for and also their social standing and everything had been taken away from them. </sentence><sentence id="2477">And by the time that the deportation started, they were totally devastated and -- and the atmosphere therefore at <span class="building">home</span>, also was  14 always -- ho-how can I describe it? </sentence><sentence id="2478">I mean morbid, maybe and -- and -- and just extremely ne- negative. </sentence><sentence id="2479">While, in -- in spite of all the hardships, Margaret's parents, first of all because they were younger and secondly because, I guess, they didn't go quite through the same amount of tremendous radical turmoil and change, had retained their sense of humor and also their, sort of some sense of ad-adventurism and -- and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2480">And I-I-I think to that extent, I-I felt comfortable there, in spite of the fact that the lot of my parents and my sister continued to be a -- a tremendous weight, I mean I-I -- by that time of course, I always hoped that they'll be in some <span class="populated place">camp</span> and -- which will be liberated at some point in the future. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2490">Q: So you have -- it was -- it was a more fun atmosphere? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2492">A: Well, funner -- well yeah, I mean to some extent that is also true, we -- for example, we -- we had brought along a -- a <span class="spatial object">phonograph player</span>, we played records, both classical as well as dance music. </sentence><sentence id="2493">I didn't know how to dance and so Margaret, who was an excellent or is still -- is an excellent dancer, taught me how to dance and -- and -- and yeah, as I said, ther-there was a certain amount of -- of -- of -- of humor and -- and -- and also light-heartedness. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And of course, that went together with the fact that I and none of us, in fact, was wearing the yellow star any more, which made us outcasts. </sentence><sentence id="2495">We felt sort of, at least I felt liberated by that and I mean all of that contributed to a -- to a -- a more positive mental outlook. </sentence><sentence id="2496">In addition, I want to say that we tried to keep as much as possible, the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="2497">I don't remember any more, how we even knew the dates, we surely didn't have any Jewish calendars, there were none printed in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2498">But we did know, for example, when Yom Kippur was and we fasted on it. </sentence><sentence id="2499">We did know when Pesach, the date was and we even kept the ornamental Seder. </sentence><sentence id="2500">Margaret's father, who was in general an excellent cook and -- and baker, baked some approximation of a matzo, which we ate and of course we didn't even have a Haggadah, but we talked about the exodus from <span class="country">Egypt</span>, just  15 from out of our memory. </sentence><sentence id="2501">I did have a handwritten copy of the Kiddush and so every Friday evening, we lit candles and made Kiddush. </sentence><sentence id="2502">If we didn't have wine, we used some other liquid, whatever came handy, even if it had to be water. </sentence><sentence id="2503">And -- and if we didn't have two candles, we cu-cut one candle into two. </sentence><sentence id="2504">And I derived a lot of strength, I think from the -- the fact, I mean, of the Jewish religion and that was actually one important pillar of -- of strength I had. </sentence><sentence id="2505">Looking back, there were three pillars of strength. </sentence><sentence id="2506">One was my Judaism, the second was my unshakable trust in the future. </sentence><sentence id="2507">I had almost certainty that <span class="country">Germany</span> would lose the war, even at a time when <span class="country">Germany</span> was -- still seemed to be winning. </sentence><sentence id="2508">And in fact I had taken along some books. </sentence><sentence id="2509">I had already decided to study physics later. </sentence><sentence id="2510">I took a book for self teaching of calculus along, which I worked through from cover to cover in those years. </sentence><sentence id="2511">And I had a physics book, which I studied. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2512">Every week I located some time to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And -- and in addition to that, by the way, we -- there was in -- in a local, bigger <span class="populated place">town</span>, there was a <span class="building">public library</span>, which we joined, of course, under our assumed names and so we checked books out, novels and other things and -- and I already said that we played music, so we -- we tried to maintain as normal an atmosphere a-as possible. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2514">So -- and -- and incidentally, I -- and in fact, none of the four of us ever had the intention, after the end of the war, to stay one day longer in <span class="country">Germany</span> than absolutely necessary and we had, at that time already, always dreamt about coming to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2515">That was sort of a dream, like -- almost like a <span class="building">castle</span> in the <span class="env feature">sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2516">And so it -- it was the Judaism and my trust in the future are the two. </sentence><sentence id="2517">The third pillar of strength was actually Margaret, as I had indicated earlier, I had at one time, in -- in the -- during -- while we -- while we were still working at the <span class="building">factory</span> at <span class="populated place">Zeemens</span>, started to fall in love with Margot, only to hear that she had a -- a -- a steady boyfriend, but by that time, I-I-I forgot what happened to the boyfriend, I think he also went <span class="interior space">underground</span>, actually and anyway, he -- he was not available and there was no contact and so my interest in <span class="building">Margot  16</span> was of course rekindled and at that time, finally, it was reciprocated. </sentence><sentence id="2518">And -- and actually she was the person really closest to me and -- who gave me much of the inner strength also. </sentence><sentence id="2519">She was sort of the third leg in that -- what -- what kept me going, emotionally I mean, mentally going. </sentence><sentence id="2520">I should also say that, one thing that I was not aware of at that time, but that -- was the arrest of my friend Huntz, which I had mentioned earlier. </sentence><sentence id="2521">All people that I had known in my earlier life, were gone. </sentence><sentence id="2522">Some of them of course had emigrated, the rest had been deported. </sentence><sentence id="2523">There was nobody from my immediate family, my first girlfriend, <span class="building">school</span> friends, factory friends, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="2524">Relatives, there was nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2525">I-I was totally alone in the world and the funny thing is, or the strange thing is that I was totally unaware of it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2526">It occurred only years after the end of the war, when I sort of went through my memory, it occurred to me that's what actually was the case. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And -- and she was the only one who was close to me and who -- who, as I said, who sustained me. </sentence><sentence id="2528">Then I-I had talked about the primitive nature of the <span class="building">house</span> we lived in, that -- <span class="building">house</span> is probably a -- a euphemism, maybe a <span class="building">cottage</span> or a <span class="building">hut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2529">I had mentioned the <span class="spatial object">pump</span> in the <span class="interior space">garden</span>, what I didn't say is, people might assume it was an <span class="spatial object">electric pump</span>, it wasn't, it was a <span class="spatial object">hand pump</span> and you had to work very hard to get water up, pumping it and as I also mentioned, in -- in winter sometimes it froze. </sentence><sentence id="2530">The <span class="building">hut</span> itself was built of wooden boards with -- with fairly wide <span class="dlf">slits</span> of what I would say an eighth of an inch or so and that made it, obviously, very uncomfortable in winter. </sentence><sentence id="2531">Through our Nazi friend, whom I had also mentioned before, we had -- we made contact to people where one could get building material. </sentence><sentence id="2532">Building material of course, were severely rationed and practically impossible to get and we got sort of insulation plates and eve-even nails were hard to get and so we co-completely insulated the <span class="building">house</span> from the <span class="dlf">inside</span> with sort of, some plastic type material. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I don't know what it is any more. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And -- and we got all that material really, through his connections. </sentence><sentence id="2535">Then one day during our stay there, suddenly the local  17 <span class="populated place">village</span> policeman came and fortunately while I was out of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2536">I was probably in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and he said he wanted to find out who was living there and asked Margaret's father all kinds of questions, where he worked and he wanted to see the ID, which he showed him and -- and where everybody else worked and whatever other questions. </sentence><sentence id="2537">And then -- and he was fairly -- he wasn't outright unfriendly, but -- but very business-like, which is in -- in -- in a rural setting in that <span class="populated place">village</span> is really unusual. </sentence><sentence id="2538">People were sort of more like a family there. </sentence><sentence id="2539">And at the end he said, "Well, I hear there's a young man living here also." </sentence><sentence id="2540">And then Mr. Haas said, "Yes, that's my nephew and his name so and so, Gunther Hessem," that was my assumed false name. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And the policeman then said, "Well, I want to ask him some questions. </sentence><sentence id="2542">When --" Yeah, and he was also told that I'm working in a <span class="building">factory</span> and then he asked when I am <span class="building">home</span> and he was told I'll be back on -- on the weekend and he said then, "Well, tell him I'll be here next Saturday," I forgot, probably 10 or whatever in the morning, "and I want to ask him some questions." </sentence><sentence id="2543">And -- and then he left and -- and we felt very threatened by that and -- and of course I was the most vulnerable because I was of military age and I did not have, as I explained earlier, the complete set of required papers, so Margaret's father went immediately to our Nazi district leader friend and complained bitterly about it, said that the village policeman, I remember his name, even. </sentence><sentence id="2544">His name was Mueller, good German name, had come and -- and interrogated him, almost like a criminal and he felt very indignant. </sentence><sentence id="2545">After all, he is an honest, honorable citizen and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And Harry, the -- the Nazi's name, said, "Oh, don't worry about it Herman, he is a good friend of mine, I'll take care of it." </sentence><sentence id="2547">And a few days later, Harry came, paid us a visit and said, "Mueller isn't going to come any more here. </sentence><sentence id="2548">I had a beer with him yesterday at the <span class="building">village pub</span> and I told him that you guys are good friends of mine and I've known you for years and you're honest, honorable people and there was no reason to." </sentence><sentence id="2549">And we never saw <span class="populated place">Mueller</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="2550">So, unwittingly,  18 the guy po-possibly might have saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="2551">I had once a close brush with arrest in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2552">As I mentioned, also earlier, the trips to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> were necessary to keep up with our <span class="building">black market</span> contacts and -- and to get food. </sentence><sentence id="2553">And I should say also, by the way, that most of the food was obtained by Margaret's father and his wife, they had of course many more contacts. </sentence><sentence id="2554">They had lived longer, they knew more people and -- but I had a number of people also, that I visited usually once a week, sometimes twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="2555">So, and I was always extremely careful. </sentence><sentence id="2556">I think I mentioned some of the strategies already that I used to avoid detection. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And when I was riding in the <span class="spatial object">subway</span>, I always rode -- sat on -- on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, sort of midway between the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, which are -- were on either end. </sentence><sentence id="2558">So -- and -- and watching the people who would enter and if somebody would enter whom I suspected or even knew, on the <span class="dlf">door</span> to the right, I would get up and leave to the left. </sentence><sentence id="2559">Not that it ever came, but at least that was my strategy. </sentence><sentence id="2560">Well, on -- on that particular day, it was rush hour and I entered the <span class="spatial object">train</span> at the <span class="building">Wittenburg Platz station</span>, in <span class="populated place">Witten</span>, in the part of -- the busiest part of the <span class="populated place">western Berlin business district</span> and since it was rush hour, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was packed with people, of course and I never got to the center, I just was sort of next to the <span class="dlf">entrance door</span> where I entered, sort of squeezed in between people. </sentence><sentence id="2561">And as I stood there, as the <span class="spatial object">train</span> rumbled and rumbled along -- and incidentally, after <span class="populated place">Wittenburg Platz</span>, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> emerged from a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> and became then an <span class="spatial object">elevator train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2562">I saw a chubby, short man next to me, say thank you to a soldier who was also standing next to him, handing back his ID, and I immediately knew that was a -- some sort of a secret policeman. </sentence><sentence id="2563">And by that time it was obviously first of all, I couldn't get out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and if I would have made one move, that would have even arranged -- aroused suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="2564">So I just looked into the <span class="env feature">air</span>, trying to look as harmless and innocent as I could, but the guy sort of swung around and fixated me with his eyes and said, "Your papers, please." </sentence><sentence id="2565">And he made me very ma -- nervous. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I had been controlled, I must say, several times  19 before and usually it went very -- people looked at my ID and I greeted them with a snappy Heil Hitler and that -- that's the job. </sentence><sentence id="2567">Well, he looked at my ID and I -- the more he looked, the more I noticed he must have been a real professional. </sentence><sentence id="2568">He -- he looked back between me and the picture, and it was of course my picture. </sentence><sentence id="2569">Then he tried to lift the picture up to see how it was fastened to the material of the ID and asked me one or two questions and I got so unbelievably nervous that I noticed that my artery in my neck started really to pump very hard and that was something that I couldn't control, but he must have noticed that. </sentence><sentence id="2570">And -- and because he -- he constantly gave me sharp looks and then I was already expected to be arrested or at least taken along for further interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="2571">Instead he handed me the paper back and said, "Thank you." </sentence><sentence id="2572">And I had the distinct feeling that guy wasn't satisfied and the reason why he didn't arrest me is he had decided it might be smarter to follow me, because I might lead him somewhere, where he could get maybe a bigger catch, or something. </sentence><sentence id="2573">So -- a-and at the next stop, which then, as I said was an elevated stop, <span class="building">Nolendorf Platz</span>, he left the tra -- he left the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2574">And I decided immediately, that guy didn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="2575">There are two possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="2576">Either he had another man with him, whom I didn't know who it was, whom he might give him -- have given some wink to follow me, or he would just have gone to the next <span class="spatial object">car</span> and wait where I would leave. </sentence><sentence id="2577">So I quickly, in my mind, made a plan of how to shake off either him, or somebody whom I may not even know. </sentence><sentence id="2578">And the next stop was <span class="dlf">Buellerstrasser</span>, was one of the busiest <span class="dlf">intersections</span> in -- in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2579"><span class="dlf">Buellerstrasser</span>, corner <span class="dlf">Putstamastrasser</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2580">And I-I left the <span class="spatial object">car</span> then and walked down and the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> from the elevated ended in a <span class="dlf">median strip</span> between the two <span class="dlf">lanes</span> of traffic, you know, going one way and one side and the opposite way in the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2581">And at the bottom of the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>, I-I knew the <span class="region">area</span> like my own pockets. </sentence><sentence id="2582">At the bottom of the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> was a <span class="building">newspaper kiosk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2583">So my plan was, and that's what I did, I stopped at the <span class="building">newspaper kiosk</span> and pretended t-to read newspapers and headlines and so  20 on, while out of my -- the corner of my right eye, I peered up, who was coming down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and I figured that if so -- if somebody whom I didn't know was going to follow me, that person would sort of linger around and I could sort of make out who it was. </sentence><sentence id="2584">Was the guy himself, of course I would know and lo and behold, I had hardly stopped and started looking at the <span class="spatial object">newspaper</span>, when I saw that guy come down. </sentence><sentence id="2585">So he obviously did what I had suspected. </sentence><sentence id="2586">He was in another <span class="spatial object">car</span> and waited for me to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2587">So I ignored him and just kept reading the newspapers and that was probably not part of his plan. </sentence><sentence id="2588">Because he had to follow me surreptitiously and if he had lingered around there, I would have been aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="2589">So he didn't He stayed, I don't know, maybe 10, 20 seconds or so and then he crossed over to one side and that was exactly what I had anticipated. </sentence><sentence id="2590">I should say also, there was a <span class="dlf">traffic light</span> at that corner of <span class="populated place">Buellerstrasser</span> and <span class="populated place">Putstamastrasser</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2591">So, once he crossed over to one side, I waited for the light to be such that traffic was going and then I made my way, sprinted between <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, to the opposite side, so that there were now two <span class="dlf">lanes</span> of moving traffic between him and me. </sentence><sentence id="2592">And then I walked along, not to -- to the busy <span class="dlf">street</span>, which was <span class="dlf">Putstamastrasser</span>, but to the next <span class="dlf">block</span>, which was a -- sort of a <span class="dlf">residential street</span>, with very few people only walking there. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And -- but I-I -- in order not to arouse suspicion, I didn't run, I just walked briskly, the way one walks purposefully in a <span class="populated place">city</span>, if one goes after some appointment or so. </sentence><sentence id="2594">And as soon as I had turned the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, I raced as fast as I could and it was about 100 meter dash to the next <span class="dlf">corner</span> and there I looked around and I saw that guy come around also, following me. </sentence><sentence id="2595">Then I-I walked, I-I turned again the corner and came back at a different <span class="dlf">block</span> of <span class="dlf">Putstamastrasser</span>, see that busy <span class="dlf">street</span>, jumped on a moving <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2596">In those days, <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span> had <span class="dlf">rear platforms</span>, without a <span class="dlf">door</span>, so you could, just by grabbing the <span class="spatial object">handlebars</span> and jumping on, you could even jump o-on a -- a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, while it was -- they -- they - - they didn't go very fast. </sentence><sentence id="2597">While it was in the middle of -- of riding, driving. </sentence><sentence id="2598">And -- in this way I  21 shook that guy off. </sentence><sentence id="2599">I am still convinced that -- that he had some suspicion, that he was not -- my paper was not that perfect. </sentence><sentence id="2600">I should also say that, over the -- by that time, though, we are into 1944 and many of my friends and acquaintances, who had gone <span class="interior space">underground</span>, or had -- one after another had been caught by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2601">I mentioned that cousin of mine, who had gone to <span class="region">Bavaria</span> and -- and his girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="2602">There were various schoolmates from my <span class="building">high school</span> class who got caught. </sentence><sentence id="2603">Then that other friend, Galcoun, who wasn't caught, but who was murdered. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2604">And -- and of course that -- that had an effect on -- on our, you know, mental outlook obviously and -- but I guess there's a -- there's a German saying which sounds very cruel, but it was really the case in our case, it's veba graba forwards, it means, "You walk forward over <span class="dlf">graves</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2605">And that's -- that was all the time what happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="2606">We -- we lost a tremendous number of friends. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2607">Some of them came back, but most did not. </sentence><sentence id="2608">During that period of time, of course, also the military situation changed more and more against <span class="country">Germany</span> and that gave us a tremendous morale boost. </sentence><sentence id="2609">I mean, by that time, in the 1943, <span class="country">Italy</span> had already capitulated and -- and then in early "44, there were continuous rumors of a landing of the Allied Forces, somewhere in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2610">And that happened finally, on June 6, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="2611">I still remember the -- the day distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="2612">Of course we didn't have any radio in our <span class="building">hut</span>, so we didn't know anything, but Margaret's parents were in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on that day, on -- on their various errands to contact <span class="building">black market</span> sources. </sentence><sentence id="2613">And they had bought extra editions of newspapers, so when they arrived out, in -- in -- in -- in our <span class="building">house</span>, in our <span class="building">cottage</span> in -- in the evening, they came with the news that the Allied had landed in the <span class="region">Normandy</span> and for Margaret, that was such a shock of joy that she broke out into tears. </sentence><sentence id="2614">I-I-I never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="2615">And -- and we were just unbelievably happy. </sentence><sentence id="2616">Of course, a-as the Allies then continued to make progress, and yeah, I should say also, incidentally, on the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, the successes were tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="2617">Even before that, in -- in 1943, I think the biggest attack battle of all  22 time took place in the area of <span class="populated place">Koosk</span> and <span class="populated place">Orwell</span>, in the <span class="region">western Soviet Union</span> and where <span class="country">Germany</span> suffered a decisive defeat. </sentence><sentence id="2618">And by that time, by 1944, when the allies landed in the -- the western allies landed in the <span class="dlf">Normandy</span>, the Russians had already taken <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and from both sides, the allies were approaching finally, <span class="region">German territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2619">And, so one response of the Nazi's was to create a new unit called folkshdum, best translated as "militia." </sentence><sentence id="2620">And all Germans who were not -- all German males, I should say, between 16 and 60, who were not in the armed forces, were immediately conscripted into that folkshdum. </sentence><sentence id="2621">And the conscription, since they didn't want to create a new bureaucracy, was -- the task of conscription was given to the Nazi party organization, which was already an existing organization with <span class="building">offices</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2622">And -- but now it became necessary to have ideas, because if you're not in the <span class="building">Vairmarkt</span>, in the armed forces or any of its branches, you had to be in the folkshdum. </sentence><sentence id="2623">It's was either one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="2624">So fortunately, Margaret's father had a -- a colleague from earlier days, also a Jewish colleague, I mean, from the <span class="dlf">garment line</span>, who was underground and he had access to blank ID's f-for the folkshdum. </sentence><sentence id="2625">And -- but what he couldn't supply was the -- the -- the rubber stamp, it -- it was stamped by the <span class="populated place">Nazi party district</span>, in which one was mustered in-into the folkshdum. </sentence><sentence id="2626">And then I remembered that I knew a <span class="building">stamp maker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2627">So I went to -- and -- and he knew me only, also under my forged, I mean assumed name, not who I really was. </sentence><sentence id="2628">And of course for stamp makers it was strictly forbidden to make official stamps because they can be used then for all kinds of purposes -- illegal purposes. </sentence><sentence id="2629">So I went to him and told him a long story, the story basically was that my uncle was working in a local <span class="populated place">party district</span>, registering folkshdum members and that in the -- in the crush and the busy work there, somehow the stamp got lost. </sentence><sentence id="2630">He thinks it may have fallen off the <span class="spatial object">table</span> into a <span class="spatial object">wastebasket</span> and then empty out, but -- but he simply didn't know what happened to it and he reported it immediately to the local -- to his boss, the district leader and the <span class="populated place">district  23</span> leader was very unhappy about that and said if that got into the wrong hands, you know, anything can be done with forgeries and he holds him personally responsible, he better look within two days, if he doesn't -- if he has not found the stamp, then he has to face consequences. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2631">So -- a-and of course the consequences in those days usually were that the party would fire him and then he would be immediately subject to military induction and be shipped to the <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And so I told that stamp maker, then finally said I would like to have that stamp within a day. </sentence><sentence id="2633">I -- I can give him, first of all, the actual cost, whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="2634">In addition to that, 300 cigarettes, 100 immediately and 200 when I get the stamp. </sentence><sentence id="2635">And in those days, cigarettes were -- were almost worth their weight in gold. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And so the guy agreed. </sentence><sentence id="2637">I had the stamp within -- less than two -- two days. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And then Margaret's father went back to his friend and they made a deal that he would give us, free of charge, two of folkshdum membership blanks and we in turn would stamp his own with the party stamp that we had, also free of charge for itwasa. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And so -- so that's what happened and of course, women didn't need a -- an ID as I said, because only males were inducted into the folkshdum militia. </sentence><sentence id="2640">So -- so we had, in fact I still have my folkshdum ID. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And -- and to have that ID was actually terrific because that obviated the need for any military papers, because only people who were not in the armed forces were inducted into the folkshdum. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And since -- and the party, of course, had all of that background material. </sentence><sentence id="2643">So, by being in the <span class="building">folkshdum</span>, that automatically implied that the military status of that person was okay, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And -- and also, of course, as the situation became more desperate for the Nazis, there were more and more ID checks on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, I mean they were looking first of all for German deserters. </sentence><sentence id="2645">They were looking for allied spies, they were looking for -- you know they had millions of foreign workers in <span class="country">Germany</span> also, they had been forcibly deported to work in the <span class="building">armaments industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2646">And many of those were on the loose, they just ran away. </sentence><sentence id="2647">So, anyway, the  24 thing was that having that paper, I'm sure saved my life, because I was then frequently controlled, particularly by military police. </sentence><sentence id="2648">Now, on the other hand, as the situation worsened, it also became more and more difficult to get food. </sentence><sentence id="2649">I-I-I should say where -- what with <span class="building">black market</span> food prices, I believe I mistakenly said in an earlier interview here, that the <span class="building">black market</span> prices were 10 times regular prices. </sentence><sentence id="2650">That -- I have to take that back, it-it's closer to 100 times. </sentence><sentence id="2651">In other words, any, say pound of meat or whatever, was -- which whose price may have been one mark regularly bought in a <span class="building">store</span> with food ration stamps, would be 100 mark on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2652">But, because of increasing shortages, because <span class="country">Germany</span> of course, used to get a lot of its food from the <span class="region">occupied areas</span> and they were no longer occupying them, obviously the scarcity grew higher and as the supply dwindled and the demand either stayed the same or increased, obviously the price increased. </sentence><sentence id="2653">So, just at that point, that problem was solved for us. </sentence><sentence id="2654">What happened was -- was that on a <span class="dlf">d</span> -- on one day, I was also in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, using the -- the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> and as I sat there, a girl -- 1 mean young woman actually, a year or two older than I, whom I had known from before, in fact she was a counselor in a vacation <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I went to in the 1930's, in the mid "30's and then later I met her again at <span class="populated place">Zeemans</span>, where she was also a forced laborer. </sentence><sentence id="2655">And she approached me and said, "Oh hi, how are you," and that, "I'm so happy to see you." </sentence><sentence id="2656">But since one didn't trust anyone whom one hadn't seen continuously, I said, "Well, my name isn't <span class="populated place">Fontheim</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2657">And -- and then she said, "Well, don't you have a smaller sister?" </sentence><sentence id="2658">I said, "No," and I gave her some fictitious name, say like my name is Irige Billow and I only have an older brother. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2659">And she sort of left the <span class="spatial object">train</span> puzzled. </sentence><sentence id="2660">And -- and at that point I decided she is obviously not working for the Gestapo because she wouldn't be put off by such a rude, crude lie. </sentence><sentence id="2661">Okay, but anyway, about a week or two later, I ran into her again on the same sort of <span class="dlf">line</span> of the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> where I met her the first time and then I admitted that -- that her memory was really correct and  25 then she said, "Oh, that's marvelous," and "let's sit down at a <span class="building">cafe</span> and -- and then have a little talk." </sentence><sentence id="2662">And I said, "That's a great idea, but I don't have any food ration coupons" And in <span class="building">restaurants</span> and <span class="building">cafes</span>, you also had to pay, obviously, the price in mark, but in addition, which was much more important, give the food coupons, equivalent for whatever you were ordering, what -- even if it was just a piece of cake. </sentence><sentence id="2663">And she said, "Och, d-d-don't bother, I invite you." </sentence><sentence id="2664">So okay, so since I was always hungry, I fo -- I accepted the invitation, so we sat down in a <span class="building">cafe</span> and talked. </sentence><sentence id="2665">Of course I have to say that I didn't tell her a thing, where I was actually living, we were just talking sort of in general terms and -- and then she said -- yeah, I mean I-I asked her whether I couldn't pay for the stamps, coupons that she used on me, she said no, she didn't pay for hers either and in fact she'll show me how to get them free of charge and all one had to do is find out where the last air raid -- there were daily air raids now. </sentence><sentence id="2666">Where the last air raid was centered at. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2667">And that was easy, that spread through <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> like fire, the news, you know, last night this <span class="populated place">district</span> was hit or that <span class="populated place">district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2668">So we went to where last night -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2669">Q: Finish your sentence. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: Oh, where last night the -- the allies had bombed, and looked up a <span class="building">house</span> that was destroyed. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2671">End of <span class="dlf">Tape Six</span>, <span class="dlf">Side A</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2672"> Beginning Tape Six, <span class="interior space">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2673">Q: This is tape one, side B of a continued interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2674">A: So we arrived at the part of <span class="populated place">town</span> where last night's air raid had done the most of the damage and then my friend -- her name by the way is Ursula, she said, ""What we need to do is first of all, write down the address of a <span class="building">house</span> that's completely destroyed, or at least remember and note it down." </sentence><sentence id="2675">So, that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And then the German, sort of air raid support system was, by years of experience, of course very well organized. </sentence><sentence id="2677">Each <span class="building">house</span> had -- I mean the -- the -- the  26 people who lived in -- in each <span class="building">house</span> knew exactly where to go if that <span class="building">house</span> became destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2678">It was usually a public -- usually a <span class="building">school</span> nearby, sometimes a <span class="building">church</span> or some such <span class="building">public building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2679">So -- and that was posted also in the -- near the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2680">So we -- after noting the address of the place, of the <span class="building">house</span> that was destroyed -- of course that was just one of many <span class="building">houses</span>, and also discovering where to go for further support, we went there and of course that was a <span class="building">school</span>, I remember and it was in the main <span class="interior space">auditorium</span> and the place was mobbed with people who had been bombed out the previous night. </sentence><sentence id="2681">Some with some of their belongings still saved and others with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And there were -- and the place was run again by a subsidiary of the Nazi party organization. </sentence><sentence id="2683">And -- and then I-I stuck with her and we -- first of all registered at a <span class="spatial object">desk</span> where a man in full Nazi party regalia was sitting. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And she would give some fictitious name and that address and saying that she lost all of her belongings, including even her papers. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And so they immediately did two things. </sentence><sentence id="2686">They gave a person a temporary ID, identifying that person as a bombed out person and also asking then all agencies of the government to sort of give any support possible. </sentence><sentence id="2687">And for people who had lost their food ration cards, they -- oh no, wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2688">I-I'm sorry, I take that back. </sentence><sentence id="2689">They did not hand out any food ration. </sentence><sentence id="2690">They simply noted down the -- listed the person as totally bombed out and then they supplied people with sandwiches and cigarettes and if they needed, also an overnight, a simple <span class="spatial object">cot</span>, although people were urged, if possible, to move in with friends or relatives, but those who didn't have either, could also stay overnight there. </sentence><sentence id="2691">So, of course I followed her example, gave a differ -- I did not give my name that I had adopted on my papers, I didn't want that to appear there. </sentence><sentence id="2692">So I chose just some arbitrary name that came to my mind, but the same address and I also got an ID, identifying me as bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="2693">Now the point was, with that ID, one could go then to any <span class="building">food rationing office</span> and get a set of food ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And the idea of course was, you couldn't do it  27 in the same <span class="populated place">district</span> where the <span class="building">building</span> was located because they had, of course, a complete card catalog of people who were living in that <span class="populated place">district</span> and -- and of course neither one of these people even existed. </sentence><sentence id="2695">But with the bombed out ID, one -- any other <span class="building">food ration office</span> -- suppose one moved to a different part of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> than was required to hand out a -- a set of food ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="2696">And of course, in another <span class="populated place">district</span>, they wouldn't have the set of -- of you know, registered people living in that <span class="populated place">district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2697">Comes to my mind, I'm glad that the tech -- to -- that today's technology didn't exist in those days, because today all they would have to do is, on a <span class="spatial object">computer</span>, access a database and look up anyone from any other <span class="populated place">di-district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2698">But fortunately the Nazis didn't have that capability yet, otherwise they would have used it. </sentence><sentence id="2699">So what we did is we took them -- the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> to a different part of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2700">Went there, got our set of food ration cards and then took off. </sentence><sentence id="2701">And that was now the first set and I enjoyed that game so much, I-I should add also, by the way, that the sandwiches they handed out were terrific. </sentence><sentence id="2702">I had not had such good sa-salami sandwiches in -- in years, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="2703">And that alone was even worth it. </sentence><sentence id="2704">So I start practically every time when I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, since there were daily air raids, there was -- there were every -- every day there were <span class="building">houses</span> destroyed the preceding night, so all one had to do was sort of ask and find out in what part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, to go there, look up an address of a destroyed, I mean <span class="building">house</span> from the -- from last night and then go to the local sort of <span class="building">air raid support facility</span>, where people were helped with their fi-first needs and so on, get another ID. </sentence><sentence id="2705">And -- and so I kept doing that and finally at the height of the thing, I got -- I-- I got food ration stamps for 16 people, without paying a penny for it. </sentence><sentence id="2706">So we could just go into <span class="building">stores</span> and -- and buy food at the regular price-controlled prices, which was peanuts. </sentence><sentence id="2707">And -- and that obviously was a tremendous help also in our -- our, you know, for our budget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2742">Q: Wasn't there any chance that there was going to be duplication? </sentence><sentence id="2743"> 28 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2744">A: Yeah, I mean -- I-I am sure that these card officers, foo-food coupon officers where I went under an assumed name then would forward my name and -- and this address that I gave to the <span class="building">food office</span> in that <span class="populated place">district</span> and then within days they would find out that person never existed there, and -- but by that time I was gone and when you -- the food ration coupons themselves didn't have a name of a person on it. </sentence><sentence id="2745">So you could -- you didn't have to be afraid that they knew already that this was, the whole thing was a fake. </sentence><sentence id="2746">I mean, I-I could use the stamps without being afraid to be identified. </sentence><sentence id="2747">It was a marvelous thing. </sentence><sentence id="2748">And yeah, also of course, the continuous air raids -- by the way, the air raids started I should say, really to become severe and shortly after we moved there, I think I discussed that even, that helped us in -- in -- in our fictitious story that we told people. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And of course it got worse as the war went on and usually it was the British bomber fleet coming at night and the Americans during daytime. </sentence><sentence id="2750">And it was sometimes an awful -- awesome, not awful -- an awesome sight during daytime. </sentence><sentence id="2751">The Americans were flying in like on a sort of military exercise, in -- in close formation. </sentence><sentence id="2752">And the roar of the <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> -- there were hundreds usually, filled the <span class="env feature">heavens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2753">It was for us almost a shout of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2754">And -- and they were just coming an-and you -- we could see the <span class="spatial object">anti-aircraft guns</span>, the German flock firing at them without much effect. </sentence><sentence id="2755">And -- and then when they start dropping their bombs, the bombs sort of had made a whistle sound as they fell down on the -- with tremendous speed. </sentence><sentence id="2756">And -- and the whistle sound then was followed by seconds of silence and then a tremendous explosion. </sentence><sentence id="2757">And of -- of course there were hundreds of them. </sentence><sentence id="2758">It -- it -- it was a -- an unbelievable experience and -- and at night of course one couldn't see the <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> any more, but the noise was the same and -- and then of course the flames that engulfed large parts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> would almost be a -- a -- present a ghostly scene of -- of fire and destruction. </sentence><sentence id="2759">And obviously that had also a tremendous effect on the population and people reacted differently, but by that time, it was obvious I think to  29 most sane people at least, that the war was lost. </sentence><sentence id="2760">And if the war was lost, then all that destruction and all of the German soldiers who were still falling on all <span class="region">fronts</span>, were just a total waste or a wasted loss, which wouldn't really do anything for <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2761">And so many -- there was a lot of dissatisfaction ex-expressed with the government. </sentence><sentence id="2762">But it was all sort of below the surface and the reason was, there was a tremendous government terror that increased. </sentence><sentence id="2763">There wasn't just the Gestapo, but I mean, the employed agents of the Gestapo, but there was a much larger army of either paid or unpaid informers, or people who are sometimes just out of spite, were informing on others. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And obviously that kept people in <span class="dlf">line</span> and they would often grumble only between their four <span class="dlf">walls</span> or to -- only to people whom they definitely knew to be okay and safe. </sentence><sentence id="2765">But there was increasing dissatisfaction as the war came closer to the <span class="dlf">German borders</span> and the -- the German government -- and particularly the propaganda machine of Goebbels, had another weapon given to them and -- and that was actually by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2766">The -- while it is understandable that the Russians, who had suffered unbelievably under German occupation were not very kindly disposed towards the Germans, but the -- the atrocities committed by the Russians and the -- the totally wanton destruction in the wake of the Soviet army, was such that Goebbels was able to whip up enthusiasm for continuing the fight by basically threatening the Germans with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And of course the worst part of the terror probably were the unbelievable rapes. </sentence><sentence id="2768">I-I must admit that I did not believe the stories at first and thought they were just an outgrowth of Goebbels propaganda, I mean in the same way how the antisemitic press, for years had smeared the Jews with all kinds of sexual innuendoes and so on, which were just inventions. </sentence><sentence id="2769">But it turns out, I mean the Russians -- incidentally, the Russians did not only do that in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I mean, even in <span class="region">areas</span> that they liberated, <span class="country">countries</span> that were supposed to be allies, like <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>, there were unbelievable rapes in those countries. </sentence><sentence id="2770">And so it can't be  30 just explained by the fact that there was an accumulated hatred against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2771">But of course that contributed to it. </sentence><sentence id="2772">But, be that as it may, they handed the Germans a tremendous propaganda weapon and -- and occasionally it would happen that the -- the German army would make a counter-offensive and sort of re-occupy some <span class="region">locality</span> which the Russians had already taken before. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And then they would immediately send in the entire press corps and -- and interview people and they would get some sort of first hand horror stories of how the Russians behaved. </sentence><sentence id="2774">And I'm sure that was part of why th-the Germans put up resistance t-to the very end But the -- the -- the fact is that resistance didn't give them any better results anyway and I would say that any <span class="building">building</span> that was destroyed and any German that was killed fighting in the latter part of "44 and "45 was just a waste. </sentence><sentence id="2775">Of course not to forget that during that time also, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Russians, still were killed and -- and also Jews were killed in the Holocaust, which continued unabated. </sentence><sentence id="2776">I should say on that subject, incidentally, the fact that a holocaust was going on was totally unknown to us. </sentence><sentence id="2777">We did occasionally -- we had opportunity to listen to foreign broadcasts and incidentally, that was strictly forbidden and it was under death penalty that if anyone listened to a foreign radio broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="2778">But sometimes we had the chance to and -- and -- and there were reports finally, mainly from <span class="building">BBC</span>, the British radio, that the Nazis were killing, at that time it was said, hundreds of thousands of Jews, and that -- while it filled us with fear, it -- the number, hundreds of thousands, was so huge that it staggered our imagination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2814">And that was not even 10 percent of the truth, but we didn't know it in -- at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2816">Q: Had you heard of some of these notorious <span class="building">extermination centers</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2818">A: Well, we definitely had heard of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and -- because that was the -- that was the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that most Jews from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> were deported to. </sentence><sentence id="2819">And -- at least in the later stages. </sentence><sentence id="2820">In the beginning there were also deportations to <span class="populated place">Riga</span> and then other <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2821">But starting, I think about in the  31 middle of 1942, maybe early fall of 1942, all deportations went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2822">Even that was not really officially announced, but it somehow became known. </sentence><sentence id="2823">So <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> became known as a destination for the deportations, but the term <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span> was not known. </sentence><sentence id="2824">I mean, what was believed in general, that Jews were worked extremely hard under inhuman conditions and of course people die under such conditions also. </sentence><sentence id="2825">But that they were sort of murdered in a mass production style, the way it was actually done, was not known to us. </sentence><sentence id="2826">It may have now -- that -- I have to add that German soldiers, hundreds of sol -- if not millions of them were in one way or another witnesses of all of these exterminations. </sentence><sentence id="2827">And -- and of course they, in -- in most cases were too fearful to even report or -- or tell the -- or even told to keep that silent. </sentence><sentence id="2828">But we were, I mean in -- in a certain amount of isolation there and -- and to some extent I have to say that it may also have been simply that we, or at least I myself, I can really only talk of mys -- about myself, simply refused to believe that, that it was so horrible and -- and all the people who were close to me were involved in -- in these deportations. </sentence><sentence id="2829">And -- and maybe to some extent I -- it was wishful thinking, that I did not believe in what really happened in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2830">But all I can say is that I hoped, til the victory and even after that, to see my family again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2844">Q: Was there -- was there -- I mean you said people were fearful to even talk about them, so was there much conversation at all about these places? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2846">A: No, I mean, even in earlier times, it was -- somewhere I-I mentioned for example that after the costan of Jewish males were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2847">They were all told that unless they wanted to come back there, to keep their mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="2848">And so people only whispered about it. </sentence><sentence id="2849">Some didn't talk at all about it and some only to the closest friends or family members, what -- what really happened and these were not <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>, they were just sort of quote everyday brutalities committed by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="2850"> 32 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2851">Q: What I'm try -- what I'm trying to get a sense of is -- since you were amongst German people, not Jews at this point -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2852">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2854">Q: And for quite a long time, did there seem to be any horror expressed or any remorse of what was going on, other than the fact that the war had inconvenienced them terribly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2856">A: No, it was terrib -- the -- the horror was only at the impending loss of the war and what might become of <span class="country">Germany</span> and of them personally. </sentence><sentence id="2857">I-I didn't -- of course, as I said, people had to be careful, but -- but the people that we associated with, and we had a certain social life there and -- and as I had or said earlier, they -- the -- the cruelties against the Jews never even came up. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Now that's -- actually there's one exception. </sentence><sentence id="2859">There was one family, an -- an elderly couple with a son who is -- was about six, seven years older than I and was an officer in the <span class="building">Vairmarkt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2860">They were politically 100 percent -- they often even talked to us and that surprised us because you know, they -- they should have been somewhat mistrustful, but they ex -- op-openly expressed their opposition and their hatred of the Nazis and Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="2861">They were -- one thing they were a very devout Catholic family. </sentence><sentence id="2862">And in <span class="region">northern Germany</span>, where <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> is located, the vast majority of people of course, are Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="2863">But I don't know whether that was the -- bu-but they were -- these people actually then, played a role in -- in our final survival. </sentence><sentence id="2864">And that's a story I'm coming to now. </sentence><sentence id="2865">In -- in March -- in March 1945, about six weeks before the end of the war, we heard through one of our friends that we sort of were socializing with, a very strange story. </sentence><sentence id="2866">He -- he met Mr. Haas, Margaret's father, and said he has to tell him something very funny. </sentence><sentence id="2867">A -- a pensioner, who lived in our <span class="region">area</span>, and who earned himself some additional money by working on people's <span class="dlf">property</span> and he worked also often on a <span class="dlf">property</span> of our neighbor and he was known as a fanatical Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="2868">And that pensioner had told him to be careful with us and stay away from us  <span class="building">33</span> because there's something not okay. </sentence><sentence id="2869">We -- he is convinced that we are either foreign spies or Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2870">And -- and then when that man said, you know, ""W-W-What makes you think so?" </sentence><sentence id="2871">The man said, "Well, they have -- they have a -- a <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> address, where Herman Hesser lives." </sentence><sentence id="2872">And there is actually a Herman Hesser living, he checked the phone book. </sentence><sentence id="2873">But he decided to really look into it himself. </sentence><sentence id="2874">And so, he -- and being a pensioner, you know he had nothing better to do, he took the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> and went to that address and actually rang the bell and there's indeed a Herman Hesser living at that place, but it's a completely different person. </sentence><sentence id="2875">And we simply used that person's name to legitimize ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2876">And he told that fellow to -- to be careful and not to say anything to us of stay -- and that guy again -- he was also, by the way, secretly very much against the Nazis and made commensur. </sentence><sentence id="2877">And he interpreted it as saying that now that the war is obviously lost, that fanatical Nazi is sort of becoming -- going out of his mind, losing his mind. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2878">And didn't take it seriously, in fact found it really funny. </sentence><sentence id="2879">And well, Margaret's father came back to us, he didn't find it funny at all, nor did we. </sentence><sentence id="2880">And we were thinking about what to do now. </sentence><sentence id="2881">Now we knew that that guy probably would, within a day or two, notify the police, if he hadn't already done so. </sentence><sentence id="2882">And that we had to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="2883">And in fact we -- we had to get out sort of seemingly just as if we go into the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2884">In other words, without <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>, in order not to arouse suspicion. </sentence><sentence id="2885">But we had all of our per-personal belongings there and many of them were also necessary for survival. </sentence><sentence id="2886">I mean we, in those days it was practically impossible to buy anything, cloth -- gloves, clothing, anything you need. </sentence><sentence id="2887">Shoes and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2888">So we -- and of course also we didn't really know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="2889">So our first reaction was to talk to that elderly couple that I just mentioned, and their son -- he was a first lieutenant in the German army, was actually <span class="building">home</span> during that week, on furlough. </sentence><sentence id="2890">I think he -- he had some sort of a sick leave, he had a slight injury. </sentence><sentence id="2891">And -- and we knew that all of them are totally okay, so the plan was that I -- but we  34 wanted to talk to the son alone first. </sentence><sentence id="2892">So I went over and asked the son, we would like to have a card game with him, he sometimes played cards. </sentence><sentence id="2893">And -- and he said, "Yeah, gladly," he'll be over in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="2894">So in a few minutes he came and we both decided, among the four of us, that the two women would stay in -- in the <span class="interior space">back room</span> and Margaret's father and I and he would sort of play the game. </sentence><sentence id="2895">So Margaret's father started out, I still feared -- to mix the -- the cards, to distribute then -- the cards, to -- to play the game, when he suddenly put down the cards on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and said -- actually, we -- we invited him not to play cards but to discuss some serious business with him. </sentence><sentence id="2896">And then he told him right of the events -- that our name isn't actually <span class="populated place">Hessem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2897">We are Jews who live here in hiding and our name is so and so and we -- and then he told him what happened with that pensioner and that we have to get out immediately or within a day at least. </sentence><sentence id="2898">And also possibly save some of our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="2899">And the -- the officer was in full uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2900">His name, incidentally, his first name is Heinz. </sentence><sentence id="2901">He listened in stony silence, then he got up and said he'll discuss everything with his parents and will be back as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="2902">After some time that to us seemed like an eternity, it was probably not more than 15, 20 minutes, I don't know -- they lived just one <span class="dlf">block</span> over from us, he came back not alone, but with his mother. </sentence><sentence id="2903">His mother was a gray haired -- sort of gray haired, dignified lady, came with a huge basket of food, which she plunked on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> with a thump and an angry face and said, "Listen, you have known our politics for -- for years now. </sentence><sentence id="2904">We have known each other closely enough, we could have helped you all that time. </sentence><sentence id="2905">How come you didn't have confidence in us to tell us that before?" </sentence><sentence id="2906">And the <span class="spatial object">food basket</span> contained things which were worth a fortune on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2907">Sausage, eggs and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2908">And their -- their behavior was just incredible. </sentence><sentence id="2909">So -- so then they, right th-they said okay, what -- what they would -- they would like to, first of all, support us in -- in hiding some of our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="2910">And after some discussion, we made the  35 following decision. </sentence><sentence id="2911">As I had mentioned earlier, every night the British Air Force, the Royal Air Force bombarded <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and of course all surrounding <span class="region">areas</span> and had <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> alert, and so people would be up and then after the all clear siren, people obviously would go immediately to sleep, because they had to get up early in the morning to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2912">So the decision was to wait about half an hour after the all clear, hoping by that time everybody will be sound asleep and in the meantime have <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> with certain necessities packed and Heinz said he would help us carry them over to their place and they have a <span class="building">shed</span> behind their <span class="building">house</span> where they could lock them up and they would be safe there. </sentence><sentence id="2913">And -- and then Heinz said he had a <span class="interior space">room</span> in -- in the southern borough of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2914">It became known later under -- during the <span class="spatial object">air lift</span> of "48, "50, because there was also an <span class="building">airport</span> that played an important role in the <span class="spatial object">air lift</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2915">But anyway, in <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span> he had a <span class="interior space">room</span> where he could, we c -- all four of us could at least temporarily stay, but or -- some of us. </sentence><sentence id="2916">And Margaret's mother knew -- had a -- a girlfriend, I mean a woman friend who was also <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2917">Now she had succeeded in totally legalizing herself with police registration and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2918">And she said that the next day, she and Margaret would try to go there and -- and -- and Ma-Margaret's father and I would go to the <span class="interior space">room</span> that Heinz had. </sentence><sentence id="2919">And then, before leaving, Heinz turned around, pulled out his revol -- service revolver, gave it to Margaret's father and said, "Here is my service revolver. </sentence><sentence id="2920">If they should come tonight, just finish them off in self defense. </sentence><sentence id="2921">The war is over soon, anyway." </sentence><sentence id="2922">And -- and then they left. </sentence><sentence id="2923">That was an incredible thing that he did. </sentence><sentence id="2924">And -- and then the next day -- I mean then, at night, right, everything worked out the way it was planned. </sentence><sentence id="2925">We carried the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> over and I don't know whether we got any sleep done or not, we probably didn't feel like it. </sentence><sentence id="2926">The next morning we left, you know, as if going to work, with no particular <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> on us. </sentence><sentence id="2927">And -- and never came back and I just want to say that after -- the few weeks after the Battle of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I came back to visit the place and neighbors told  36 us that the following day, the Gestapo came looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="2928">So that -- that really saved our lives. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2929">So I-I, yeah -- then in that <span class="interior space">room</span> where we stayed, incidentally, Heinz knew that the superintendent of the <span class="building">house</span>, a janitor, was a secret Communist. </sentence><sentence id="2930">I don -- I never knew how -- how he actually knew that because that was itself subject to execution, but anyway he knew and -- and he said he will talk to him about us, because he would -- he -- in -- in -- in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="building">apartment house</span> janitors were responsible to have every new person who appears, registered with the police, I discussed that earlier. </sentence><sentence id="2931">So -- but he said, if -- he -- he would not tell him that we are Jews, that doesn't fly well with Communists, we -- he'll just tell him -- tell him that we are some Socialist activists and have to hide out. </sentence><sentence id="2932">And so that's what he did and we were intoruss -- in fact I remember the janitor's name, Kuchinski, sort of a Polish name, huh? </sentence><sentence id="2933">And -- but I mean, he was a German. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And -- but Kuchinski himself had access to <span class="building">black market</span> pistols. </sentence><sentence id="2935">And so I bought a <span class="spatial object">pistol</span> from him and -- for my own self protection and I had never had a gun in my hand in my life and I decided if I, you know, ever have to use it in an emergency, I don't even -- I-I barely knew where to pull the trigger, but not how to aim and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2936">So I bought additional ammunition, and that was also expensive. </sentence><sentence id="2937">Each bullet costs -- I forgot, substantial amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="2938">And from a piece of paper, I made myself a -- sort of a goal to aim at, with concentric circles and then I-I traveled out into a <span class="env feature">forest</span> near <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and nailed it to a <span class="env feature">tree</span>, of course in a solitary place where no people were around and then I sort of practiced shot. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And I -- and you know, in those days these more old fashioned guns, I think today -- they had a tremendous sort of a backlash. </sentence><sentence id="2940">And all I remember is I never even hit the <span class="dlf">outer circle</span>, not to speak of the <span class="dlf">inner circle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2941">But at least I knew a little bit of how to handle the thing. </sentence><sentence id="2942">And actually I never had to use it, but at least it gave me also some self confidence just to carry it with me. </sentence><sentence id="2943">In the meantime, as I said, Margaret's mother and she herself were with that woman friend of Mrs. Haas. </sentence><sentence id="2944">And -- and in the meantime they --  37 they knew some other people, through whom they finally found a place in <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2945">Now <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> is a <span class="populated place">suburb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2946">It used to be the summer residence of Prussian kings. </sentence><sentence id="2947">And there's particularly one famous <span class="building">castle</span>, the one of Frederick the Great, called <span class="populated place">Soswasee</span>, which is French of course, means without worries or no worries. </sentence><sentence id="2948">And that summer -- he was actually a great Francophile and basically even talked mainly French and had his <span class="building">castle</span> and also his <span class="dlf">garden</span> surrounding the <span class="building">castle</span> designed in imitation of <span class="populated place">Versailles</span>, on a much smaller scale, of course. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2949">And it also contained an <span class="building">orangery</span>, just like the <span class="dlf">park</span> in <span class="populated place">Versailles</span> does. </sentence><sentence id="2950">The <span class="building">orangery</span> basically served to keep plants in winter, which were -- which were not durable during winter. </sentence><sentence id="2951">And also a <span class="interior space">servant's quarters</span> for the gardeners. </sentence><sentence id="2952">And that <span class="building">orangery</span> had been turned into a huge sort of <span class="populated place">camp</span> for people who were out, bom-bombed out and also for refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2953">I-I forgot to say that, actually. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2954">As the Soviet army moved westward and came into <span class="region">areas</span> which were inhabited by Germans, the Germans were systematically evicted from everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2955">And even that was, it started already before, I am now talking about March and early April, "45. </sentence><sentence id="2956">Even in -- in midwinter, the -- the Germans were evicted and day and night you could hear, on the <span class="dlf">country road</span> that passed by near that <span class="building">cottage</span> where we lived, horse drawn <span class="spatial object">carriages</span> with ref -- German refugees, hundred them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2957">And, although that obviously was tremendous personal misery for these people, it filled me with a tremendous joy to see, finally, the hardships of the war hitting back at those who had caused all the misery to us, but also to other peoples. </sentence><sentence id="2958">And -- and so there were millions and millions of German refugees, who were streaming westward, into the still unoccupied <span class="region">areas</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, including <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2959">And so, that <span class="building">orangery</span>, as I said, was a huge <span class="populated place">camp</span> for such people and so people whom the Haas's knew, who -- who were themselves out bombed and lived there, they were introduced simply as a family that was bombed out, but they said also they knew of my existence, that it is too unsafe to have me there, because why would a youn-young 20, 22 year  38 old or so man be living there? </sentence><sentence id="2960">I mean he would be normally in the <span class="building">Vairmarkt</span>, fighting. </sentence><sentence id="2961">So I stayed then, alone in that <span class="interior space">room</span> of Heinz in -- in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, in the district of <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span> and they were out there. </sentence><sentence id="2962">Of course I had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I commuted -- I forgot what, once or twice a week out there. </sentence><sentence id="2963">One reason also is I had all these food coupons that I collected and kept collecting and so I also brought food out there. </sentence><sentence id="2964">And -- and -- and as -- as the war slowly sort of wound down to an end. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Now, the Battle of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, 1-it -- yeah ona, I-I-I-I should say one other thing before the battle. </sentence><sentence id="2966">Th-th-the Germans made -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2967">Q: Why don't you finish that thought and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2968">A: No, but th-that's a totally new subject. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2970">Q: Okay, then why don't we stop here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2972">End of <span class="dlf">Tape Six</span>, <span class="dlf">Side B</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2973"> Beginning of Tape Seven, <span class="dlf">Side A</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2974">Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with <span class="populated place">Emest Fontheim</span>, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence><sentence id="2975">The interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2976">A: Yeah, as the war finally came <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="country">Germany</span>, we were delighted to see in the official vairmarkten, armed forces report, that was issued at the end of each day, finally German place names. </sentence><sentence id="2977">Names like Argen, Kern and so on, instead of names like <span class="populated place">Zabororja</span>, <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, <span class="populated place">Halokoff</span>, <span class="populated place">Kiev</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2978">That al-already felt like a liberation and there were more and more German place names now in the official army reports. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And all -- while all that happened, the government maintained the <span class="dlf">official line</span> that the war will be won, that there will be a final victory. </sentence><sentence id="2980">As the <span class="dlf">fronts</span> on all sides collapsed, of course preparations were made for the defense of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2981">I have to say, that of all the insanities, that may have been probably the biggest one. </sentence><sentence id="2982">There was n-no reason really, to defend <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and the Germans should have done what the French did in 1940,  39 declared an open <span class="populated place">city</span> and surrendered. </sentence><sentence id="2983">But of course that was not to be. </sentence><sentence id="2984">Instead, throughout <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="spatial object">tank traps</span> were built, <span class="dlf">ditches</span> were dug. </sentence><sentence id="2985">And the folkshdum was called up, finally, for participating in the defense of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2986">And often they would even grab civilians from the <span class="dlf">street</span> and just incorporate them in some <span class="spatial object">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2987">The battle itself began in earnest on April the 16th, 1945. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2988">I never forget that day, because even though the -- the <span class="region">Russian front</span> was on the <span class="region">east side</span> of the <span class="env feature">Oda river</span>, which runs north-south and about 50 to 60 miles east of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, so it was pretty far away, but the artillery barrage was such that the <span class="env feature">ground</span> under <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, under the <span class="populated place">city</span>, was rumbling and slightly shaking. </sentence><sentence id="2989">And of course, in battle reports, which I read long after the end of the war, I can see the reason why. </sentence><sentence id="2990">That was the biggest concentration of <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> ever. </sentence><sentence id="2991">The Russians spent about two months getting ready for that assault on the <span class="populated place">city</span> and they had assembled a density of artillery which was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="2992">And they raked the entire <span class="region">German front</span> for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="2993">As I said, that -- at that time I was living in the <span class="populated place">Berlin borough</span> of <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span> and through the Communist, I mean secretly Communist janitor of the <span class="building">house</span> that I lived in, I also got some information of how the folkshdum members were called up and in fact he showed me such a call up order that a friend of his got. </sentence><sentence id="2994">So I-I kept a copy of that and then typed on a <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span> that I had available, my own call up order, every day. </sentence><sentence id="2995">So that if I had to -- I had an errand to a certain part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, I would write myself a call up order that I had to report there for duty. </sentence><sentence id="2996">The reason was that there were -- I mean groups of folkshdum people either grabbing civilians from the <span class="dlf">street</span>, or also sometimes they are confiscating their <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2997">I-I did all of my -- or almost all of my commuting by <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2998"><span class="spatial object">Public transport</span> had all but ceased to exist. </sentence><sentence id="2999">There were still a few <span class="dlf">subway lines</span> that were -- would run intermittently between a few stops until they came to a place where there was an artillery or a <span class="dlf">bomb crater</span>, shutting down the - - the rest of the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3000">So that was surely not reliable <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3001">But the folkshdum did have the  40 power to confiscate <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> for service, so I always -- I wrote my marching order always in such a way that it -- it would say I have to appear with my <span class="spatial object">b-bicycle</span>, which for purposes of my service, is confi-confiscated by the folkshdum, the -- the <span class="building">militia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3002">I kept visiting a number of friends and there was a peculiar atmosphere then. </sentence><sentence id="3003">By -- by that time the Russians were still far away from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but nobody knew how the Russians would take the <span class="populated place">city</span>, what would happen afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="3004">After all, the <span class="populated place">city</span> was still totally dominated by the Nazis, not just the military, also propaganda-wise. </sentence><sentence id="3005">Goebbels's voice was everywhere, in -- in <span class="spatial object">newspapers</span>, on the radio. </sentence><sentence id="3006">And it -- it seemed as if a deep <span class="env feature">chasm</span> sort of separated us -- our today, from what would happen tomorrow after the Nazis are gone and nobody could really imagine how it would be like. </sentence><sentence id="3007">From day to day of course, the Russians worked their way closer to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and in fact, the way they planned their attack, instead of entering the <span class="populated place">city</span> from the east, they passed -- their <span class="spatial object">units</span> passed by <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to the north and <span class="region">south</span>, and then closed the pincer west of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and -- and then entered the <span class="populated place">city</span> from the <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3008">After -- and then the joy of hearing <span class="populated place">German city</span> names in the official army report was placed by the -- replaced by the even greater joy of hearing su-subdivisions and districts of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> mentioned in the -- in the army report. </sentence><sentence id="3009">Like parts of <span class="populated place">Shallotenburg</span>, which is a well known <span class="populated place">borough</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, had fallen into <span class="country">Russian</span> hands. </sentence><sentence id="3010">Or the suburban <span class="building">railroad station</span> of <span class="populated place">Eichner</span> has been taken by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3011">It simply seemed unbelievable that these names, these place names, where I had been sometimes only days before, were already in Russian hands. </sentence><sentence id="3012">In fact, there was a curious situation developing. </sentence><sentence id="3013">People could make telephone calls into parts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> which were already occupied by the Russians, which were behind the <span class="dlf">Russian lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3014">That was the weirdest thing, really. </sentence><sentence id="3015">And visiting people, one usually parted never knowing whether one would see each other again and instead of the German Auf Weidersain, which means really, "See you again." </sentence><sentence id="3016">One would greet each other, I mean say good-bye with a formaller Ubalips -- that means,  41 "Survive it." </sentence><sentence id="3017">And as I said, nobody could even imagine how life would be once the Nazis were gone. </sentence><sentence id="3018"><span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was, of course under constant bombardment and in the beginning, when the first artillery shells fell on the <span class="populated place">city</span> in the -- in -- in the <span class="region">inner parts</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, Goebbels distributed a news release saying that these are not enemy artillery bombardment, but trial runs of a new German sort of miracle weapon, which is going to be used any day now, to throw the Russians back again. </sentence><sentence id="3019">And there were people who believed this nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="3020">Yeah, let me -- so the -- the -- the <span class="populated place">city</span> and of course also electricity slowly stopped being supplied and water stopped being supplied in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, even it -- it had already been drained by evacuation of ma -- children and infirm people. </sentence><sentence id="3021">There were still, I think, between three and four million people in the <span class="populated place">city</span> and to imagine, that <span class="populated place">city</span> was sort of headed into chaos, without -- without running water, without at least reliable electricity and the <span class="dlf">gas lines</span> on many places were -- had been, of course, hit. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And so there was no gas supply any more for cooking. </sentence><sentence id="3023">The -- for me the crucial day was Sunday and I remember distinctly, Sunday, April 22nd, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3024">On -- by orders of Goebbels, who, besides all his other <span class="building">offices</span>, was also in charge of the defense of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, on his orders, all <span class="building">food st-stores</span> were ordered to be open. </sentence><sentence id="3025">Now anyone who knows <span class="country">Germany</span> and German mentality, must be aware that the closing of <span class="building">stores</span> on Sunday, of all <span class="building">stores</span>, was something absolutely holy. </sentence><sentence id="3026">There was nothing -- there was always one day, one Sunday -- that was the Sunday before Christmas, where <span class="building">stores</span> were open, that was a tradition, but on all other Sundays, nothing -- the world had to go under for -- for an order to be issued for <span class="building">stores</span> to be open. </sentence><sentence id="3027">And that of course, exactly was what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="3028">I mean their world was going under. </sentence><sentence id="3029">And it was obvious then, that what Goebbels wanted to avoid is that the <span class="building">food stores</span> and the <span class="building">shops</span> might be maybe taken by Russian troops. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And rather than have that happen, had to distribute it to the population. </sentence><sentence id="3031">And in fact, there was enough food there that he also announced the distribution of all kinds of special rations. </sentence><sentence id="3032">See  42 how the -- the ration coupons had -- of course most coupons were dedicated, like it would say for 100 gram of butter or 100 gram of meat or whatever, this and that. </sentence><sentence id="3033">But there were certain coupons always which were unassigned. </sentence><sentence id="3034">They were just labeled with a letter, like A, B, C or something, for special occasions. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And so, he -- he announced that on coupon A, everybody would get so much of this food and on coupon B, so much of that food. </sentence><sentence id="3036">There was a -- a -- a tremendous amount of these special rations amounts. </sentence><sentence id="3037">Now here I was with my 16 food ration cards for 16 people. </sentence><sentence id="3038">So I basically went wild. </sentence><sentence id="3039">I went -- found -- of course that was in the days before the <span class="building">supermarket</span>, so in other words, you had to go to the <span class="building">butcher</span> separately and to the <span class="building">baker</span> and to the <span class="building">dairy</span>, for each particular type of food. </sentence><sentence id="3040">And so I was busy for a long time, you know, buying all that and coll -- and bringing it into the <span class="interior space">room</span> which I occupied in -- in <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span> and thinking how I can get most of it out to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, to my friends. </sentence><sentence id="3041">And -- and then -- but even more overpowering was, that on that day, finally, beaten German army units started to stream into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3042">And that is a sight which I will never forget, I think that made -- that day I can say without equivo-vocation may be the happiest day in my life. </sentence><sentence id="3043">Anyone who has seen German soldiers in -- in an ordinary life or in -- du-during the war or on -- on parades, they always looked spic and span, there was not a button missing, there was not a spot. </sentence><sentence id="3044">An-and -- and they all -- an-and they looked well-shaved, clean and -- and with a certain aggressive stride and demeanor. </sentence><sentence id="3045">These guys who came back, they were dirty, unshaved. </sentence><sentence id="3046">Their uniforms had buttons missing. </sentence><sentence id="3047">Many had bloody bandages around their head or their arms in a sling. </sentence><sentence id="3048">None of them bore any weapons and -- and they had that dull look of defeat in their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3049">Wh-wh-when I saw those guys, I finally -- even though I knew the war was lost for <span class="country">Germany</span> of course, somehow intellectually and mentally, but now I saw it with my own eyes and I almost lost my mind. </sentence><sentence id="3050">I-I got on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, I remember and bicycled along and felt almost like thanking each of these soldiers  43 for the way they looked. </sentence><sentence id="3051">I-I'm somewhat of a history buff and I had read reports of Napoleon's army streaming back from <span class="country">Russia</span> after their defeat in 1812 and -- and these guys looked exactly like those descriptions of Napoleon's defeated army. </sentence><sentence id="3052">And -- and then the -- the eerie thing was that now and then truckloads of newly outfitted soldiers, who looked clean and fresh and with weapons, drove into the opposite direction, towards the -- towards the front, which was probably just, I don't know, 10 or 20 miles or so away, if that much. </sentence><sentence id="3053">So -- but then I -- I finally sort of grabbed a hold of myself and -- and went back to the <span class="building">house</span> and this <span class="building">German apartment houses</span> are always sort of built with a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> in the back and the rumor spread that -- there was one person apparently, who for some reason owned a horse and he couldn't feed that horse anymore and so he decided to have it slaughtered by a professional butcher. </sentence><sentence id="3054">But of course there was no refrigeration either, so he couldn't say, keep the -- the meat for-forever. </sentence><sentence id="3055">So he invited just anyone from the <span class="building">house</span> to serve himself. </sentence><sentence id="3056">So it was incredible, I-I got myself a long, sharp knife and went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and cut a sort of a big chunk out of the upper thigh, or the rear end of -- of the horse, of the dead horse that was lying there. </sentence><sentence id="3057">And a-as -- as -- as another sort of <span class="spatial object">trophy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3058">And -- and then another rumor spread that was -- th- there -- there was a huge <span class="dlf">freight yards</span> of the <span class="dlf">German railroads</span>, about -- less than a mile away from that <span class="building">apartment building</span> and the rumor spread that the <span class="building">Vairmarkt</span>, the German army had just abandoned and withdrawn from the <span class="dlf">freight yards</span> and that there were many <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> loaded with food. </sentence><sentence id="3059">And then I got on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> with a knapsack and -- and bicycled to the -- to the <span class="dlf">freight yard</span> and I saw already people streaming there from all over and -- and then the -- the <span class="dlf">freight yard</span> was periodically raked with machine gun fire from deep diving Russian <span class="spatial object">fighter planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3060">And you know, to avoid being shot, I-I sort of threw the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> away and -- and I had to -- anyway I wasn't on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, it was across <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, so I-I-I walked, pushed it. </sentence><sentence id="3061">And then I-I threw myself down, pressed myself against the -- sort of the --  44 wh-what are these, these wooden ties, I guess, the railroad ties and -- until the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> had gone and then I would get up. </sentence><sentence id="3062">So then I-I came to a -- to a <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span>, which had, was loaded with big <span class="spatial object">vats</span> full of butter, so ea-each one, maybe 50 pounds or so. </sentence><sentence id="3063">And -- so how do you -- an-and that was sort of solid butter, so how do you grab solid butter? </sentence><sentence id="3064">Well, I had a -- I had a huge screwdriver in a tool kit on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, so I got that screwdriver out and sort of staked out a huge sort of a cube of butter and took it with my hands and threw it in my, into my knapsack, which at other times, I had taken potatoes in, with dirty peels and -- and -- and coal and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3065">So what I decided, if the outer layer of the butter is covered with dirt, I'll just cut off a layer and then inside it should be clean. </sentence><sentence id="3066">So, anyway -- so then I-I-I took that back and -- and my <span class="interior space">room</span> that I had in that <span class="building">house</span> was like a veritable sort of food storage place. </sentence><sentence id="3067">Incidentally, as a side light, when I came back after the war, I-I was told that maybe half an hour or so after I left that place, the folkshdum turned up there, collected all males, put them on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and drove them out to the front. </sentence><sentence id="3068">So I was spared having to fight the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3069">And -- and then I decided I-I better get al -- o-o-on the one hand I didn't want to get out of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, because I felt a tremendous inner excitement, to see the fall of a major <span class="populated place">capital</span>, which had a sort of world dominating role played, was to me like -- see, witnessing the fall of <span class="populated place">Rome</span> to the Germanic tribes, whatever, 2000 years or so earlier and that filled me with excitement. </sentence><sentence id="3070">But on the other hand, I -- I really felt that I wanted to spend these hours with Margaret and so I-I finally -- what I did is I wrote myself a marching order for the folkshdum, which said that my battalion that I belonged to, had to report for duty in <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, which I h-had earlier mentioned, the <span class="populated place">suburb</span> where Margaret and her parents had found a place. </sentence><sentence id="3071">And I put as much into the <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> as I could, I mean the more s -- vulnerable things of course, were the butter and also the -- the chunk of horsemeat. </sentence><sentence id="3072">And -- and then a few other things, I don -- I-I forgot what it was, anyway, was a knapsack just full with  45 food and -- and by that time also, the army had taken over traffic control and at each major <span class="dlf">intersection</span>, there were transportation officers directing traffic of course, what there was was the traffic was all military by that time. </sentence><sentence id="3073"><span class="spatial object">Military trucks</span> and -- and <span class="spatial object">jeeps</span> and this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3074">And there was a major <span class="dlf">intersection</span> near the <span class="building">house</span> where I lived and I-I went up to the officer in charge and told him that I had been ordered to report into <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> and whether he knew whether the <span class="dlf">highway</span> to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> was still open or whether the Russians had cut it. </sentence><sentence id="3075">By the way, the Russians then were always referred to by their nickname, Ivan. </sentence><sentence id="3076">So -- Ivan in English. </sentence><sentence id="3077">So -- I - - that's how you talked about them, with a Ivan, because no -- nobody really knew it and -- and the officers answer was that he knows only what goes on within a radius as far as he can see in each direction. </sentence><sentence id="3078">And he -- he didn't under -- it was just total chaos. </sentence><sentence id="3079">And -- and -- and those idiots were still fighting and -- and defending the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3080">And by the way, at each of these <span class="dlf">intersections</span>, like that also, there were heavy guns and -- put into place, that -- so that in case <span class="spatial object">Russian tanks</span> would appear, they would immediately be subject to heavy artillery fire. </sentence><sentence id="3081">So anyway, I decided, I mean to see whether I can get through to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, there were rumors that the Russians had already cut that <span class="dlf">highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3082">And I got on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and with my marching orders and everything and -- and set out. </sentence><sentence id="3083">And that trip to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> was a -- a -- a major experience. </sentence><sentence id="3084">Th-the -- the -- the <span class="dlf">highway</span> was mobbed, <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> was in the direction sort of southwest of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3085">In other words, sort of away from the <span class="region">eastern front</span> and it was full with people. </sentence><sentence id="3086">And -- and all kinds. </sentence><sentence id="3087">There were groups of allied soldiers, I mean British and French, who were obviously prisoners of war and which you had seen throughout the war, always in groups, but under heavy German military guard. </sentence><sentence id="3088">These guys, they were simply walking down there, no-nobody even, they were part of the population, nobody even gave a damn that they were supposed to be under German military guard. </sentence><sentence id="3089">I suppose they were trying to get <span class="building">home</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="3090">There were foreign laborers. </sentence><sentence id="3091">There  46 were people who pushed, sort of some belongings they wanted to save, in -- in <span class="spatial object">baby carriages</span> or in little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> that they pulled. </sentence><sentence id="3092">And then -- now and then a -- a fancy, big <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span>, with the driver leaning on the horn to make way, was slowly making its way, getting some big shot out of the <span class="populated place">city</span> before the Russians would take it. </sentence><sentence id="3093">And then, in the midst of all of that, periodically, <span class="spatial object">Russian fighter planes</span> would st-swoop down and rake the <span class="dlf">street</span> with machine gun fire and then everybody, like on a -- a -- as even blown away by the wind, would vanish to the sides of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3094">And there are sort of <span class="dlf">rainwater ditches</span> on each side, and lie down there until that danger was over, then get back up and walk. </sentence><sentence id="3095">It was the most incredible, it was a -- a -- the -- part of it I <span class="spatial object">bicycled</span>, part I pushed. </sentence><sentence id="3096">Yeah, there were some <span class="region">areas</span> where there was a b -- one <span class="region">area</span>, I think, where a <span class="dlf">water main</span> was broken and the -- the <span class="env feature">water</span> was almost knee high. </sentence><sentence id="3097">So you had to wade through that and -- anyway -- and -- and then finally I arrived at the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> which connected <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, the -- there was actually, at the <span class="region">western outskirts</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> is a -- there was a <span class="spatial object">havel</span>, spelled exactly by the way, the same way as the name of the president of the <span class="country">Czech Republic</span>, H-a-v-e-l. That <span class="env feature">river</span> also separates <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, there's a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> leading over it and that's how you get then, from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> into <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3098">The name of the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> is <span class="building">Gleenic arburger</span> and -- which became famous several decades later, which I couldn't have known at that time, of course. </sentence><sentence id="3099">It's famous because that's where, often, spies were exchanged. </sentence><sentence id="3100">Yeah, that was, of course, <span class="populated place">West Berlin</span>, then. </sentence><sentence id="3101">What -- what became later <span class="populated place">West Berlin</span> and among others for example, the Jewish refusnik Anatoly Sharunski, now an Israeli minister, Nathan Sharunski was exchanged there and given freedom on that <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3102">Well, anyway, at that <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, I saw already, at the distance, was completely, there was a -- like a chain across the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, of SS, checking carefully everybody's papers. </sentence><sentence id="3103">So -- but I had my folkshdum ID and my marching orders to report to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, so I figured nothing can happen. </sentence><sentence id="3104">I-I had in my breast pocket also, the gun which I  47 had bought on the <span class="building">black market</span>, through that janitor, but I was hoping not to have to use it. </sentence><sentence id="3105">And of course there was such a <span class="env feature">sea</span> of humanity, they obviously didn't really have the time anyway to do very thorough checks, but they found my papers to be in order and -- and then I-I passed through and I had to still <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> through a major part of <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>, because the <span class="dlf">park</span> of <span class="populated place">Soswasee</span>, where that <span class="building">orangery building</span> was located, was on the other side of <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> and -- and then I appeared there and they had already almost given up hope that I would be able to get out of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3106">So that was the 22nd. </sentence><sentence id="3107">But I had still a lot of food left in the -- in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, so I decided the next day, I ought to go back and -- and pick up some more food. </sentence><sentence id="3108">And when I arrived at the <span class="building">Gleenic Arburger</span> to <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> across, the commanding officer told not just me, but everybody else, that Russians were reported nearby -- oh yeah, and -- and of course all <span class="dlf">bridges</span> had been -- had been supplied with explosive charges, so that at the approach of Russian troops, they would be blown up so that they couldn't use the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3109">That was another part of the insanity, because while the Russians could have used the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, these <span class="dlf">bridges</span> also were part of the German infrastructure, which at that time was already almost totally destroyed and -- and under those conditions, with a -- a lack of raw materials and so on, wasn't easily re-buildable in - - in those days. </sentence><sentence id="3110">But -- but the Germans and -- and particular the Nazi party fa -- we-were so fanatic, that they completely disregarded the needs of their own population, even. </sentence><sentence id="3111">But I mean, they had it coming. </sentence><sentence id="3112">The -- with all of that, I -- my thoughts always go back again to the period of the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="3113">And how brutally the Jews were treated and nobody gave a damn about them either at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3114">And -- and furthermore, I didn't even know yet, what had become of my parents and everybody else who had been close to me or whom I had known and I was still hoping to see them back once that whole thing was over. </sentence><sentence id="3115">And I decided t-to go across the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> anyway, hoping that they wouldn't dynamite it soon. </sentence><sentence id="3116"> 48 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3117">Q: It's okay, it's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3118">A: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="3119">And -- but then I was finally stopped, as I said, when I came to <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> the day before, there was a place where a <span class="dlf">water main</span> had broken and the water was almost knee high. </sentence><sentence id="3120">Where by th-the next day I came back, it was even higher and it was under a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3121">And I mean that, it was practically impossible to -- you'd have to swim across and of course I would have been completely wet then and -- anyway, I didn't have the stomach to do it, so -- and how would I have taken the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> through it? </sentence><sentence id="3122">So I just returned without having been able to get into the <span class="populated place">city</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="3123">Th-There was constant artillery bombardment of course. </sentence><sentence id="3124">The 22nd, by that time, was over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3125">That was the day when I went out. </sentence><sentence id="3126">Now the day where I made the unsuccessful attempt to return, was the 23rd. </sentence><sentence id="3127">So that is over now, then there were several days -- there were several days of -- of fighting and -- and finally on the twent -- yeah -- and final -- yeah -- wh-what we had to do also is, we finally decided -- we meaning all of the people who lived there as refugees, to transfer to the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3128">There was a huge <span class="interior space">basement</span> with s-sort of simple <span class="spatial object">benches</span> and actually no electricity, only some candles we had occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="3129">And we just sort of hoped to wait out the worst danger. </sentence><sentence id="3130">On the 27th of April, there was still no change, there was still artillery rumble and -- but we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3131">So I decided I ought to go out and look and see what the situation is. </sentence><sentence id="3132">I went out and didn't see a soul until I finally saw a man in what looked to me like the uniform of the -- an engineering battal -- the German army had engineering battalions which had sort of brownish type uniforms, which were used in support of the troops. </sentence><sentence id="3133">I mean, to - - to build more quickly, <span class="dlf">bridges</span> over <span class="env feature">rivers</span> and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3134">And so I-I shouted at the guy and wanted to -- to know where -- wh-whether he knew where Ivan is. </sentence><sentence id="3135">His response was to point his gun at me and shout back at me in a language that I had never heard before. </sentence><sentence id="3136">And run toward me as I stood there with my raised arms and then he grabbed my left arm, saw the watch, gave it a  49 strong jerk, pulled the watch off and vanished again. </sentence><sentence id="3137">So from that I knew that the Russians had arrived, which I related <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3138">And from then on we frequently were visited by Russians who came down there. </sentence><sentence id="3139">They were interested only in two things. </sentence><sentence id="3140">One was the women and the other one was possessions of any value. </sentence><sentence id="3141">They took everybody's watches of course and other valuables and -- and many women were taken, not just once, but innumerable times. </sentence><sentence id="3142">And -- and so that went on for a day or two and -- and of course caused everyone to be totally demoralized and -- and then I think on -- on the second day or so, I -- there -- there was an artillery unit actually stationed in front of the <span class="building">orangery building</span>, fighting was still going on in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3143">And that <span class="building">artillery unit</span> was under the command of a colonel who made a more educated impression than the run of the mill Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3144">And in particular, he spoke fairly fluent German. </sentence><sentence id="3145">And -- so Margaret's father went up to him and introduced himself and told him that -- that we are Jews, whether -- that's the first Russian word that I learned, Jew means Yvrai in -- in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="3146">And -- and we were treated just like the Germans, even though we had suffered under them, just the same way the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3147">So the colonel pulled out a piece of paper and wrote something down in Russian and said whenever in the future, Russians sort of try to attack us or molest us, to show that paper. </sentence><sentence id="3148">And okay -- and then he -- he got orders to move on, which he did. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3149">And then -- now unbeknownst to me also, by the way, the -- the Russian commander in the <span class="region">area</span>, had ca-called on all German forces to surrender and furthermore had, i-in that order also, had declared that any German who tries to eva -- any German soldier who tries to evade captivity by putting on civilian clothes, will be treated by the Soviet armed forces exactly the same way as he would have been treated by the German forces. </sentence><sentence id="3150">And the German force -- the German forces, I mean that was already going on for months. </sentence><sentence id="3151">Any deserter was, after a brief re -- cursory so called <span class="building">military tribunal</span>, was immediately hung from a <span class="env feature">tree</span> and with a sign around his neck, I am too  50 much of a coward to fight for my <span class="country">country</span> and -- and for our women and children. </sentence><sentence id="3152">And -- or something of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="3153">In other words, what it meant is that if a German civilian was found, he could be immediately executed by the Russians, because they would interpreted that as the guy being a deserter, trying to evade captivity. </sentence><sentence id="3154">So I was out, on -- on that day and that was about, I think a day after that colonel came, either the same day, later or the next day. </sentence><sentence id="3155">And a-again, a Russian soldier was in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, whereas -- as soon as he saw me, he pointed his gun at me and -- and pointed me toward a <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3156">As I said, it was in a <span class="dlf">park</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="3157">And I saw immediately that he was going to execute me. </sentence><sentence id="3158">So I shouted down into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> for Margaret's father to come up, because he had that paper that that Russian colonel had -- had given him, in Russian. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3159">And he came running up and handed the paper to that Russian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="3160">He looked at it and made a motion with it, as if he was wiping his rear end with it, sort of put it in his fist and crumpled it up and threw it away and told him to wait there too. </sentence><sentence id="3161">Then I stood at the <span class="env feature">tree</span> while he aimed at me. </sentence><sentence id="3162">And at that moment, the only thing I could think of is, I survived the Nazis and now I end up like this. </sentence><sentence id="3163">And I could hear the click of the trigger, but nothing came out and he did that two or three times and then he got mad and sort of threw his gun on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and shouted to me at Russian -- in -- in Russian, which I didn't understand and pointing at the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, what it obviously meant, that I should wait for him there at the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, to be shot when he comes back with a different gun. </sentence><sentence id="3164">And of course then Margaret's father and I, we immediately ran -- there was some <span class="env feature">bushes</span> not too far away and hid sort of right at the bottom there. </sentence><sentence id="3165">And it wasn't long, I don't know, maybe five minutes, maybe less, I don't -- when he came back and -- and we heard him shout and I was just sweating with fear. </sentence><sentence id="3166">And we know that wouldn't be long until he found us and all we heard is he kept shouting and then new voices appeared, more voices and -- which -- wa -- since we didn't know Russian, I don't know what all these voices were saying, but apparently they had to move  51 on because the voices became more and more distant and -- and then finally ceased. </sentence><sentence id="3167">And -- but we decided that maybe the guy is just lying in wait for us, so we -- we waited there for at least an hour, if not more. </sentence><sentence id="3168">And -- co -- wa-was completely silent, until we were sure that he really had left the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3169">End of <span class="dlf">Tape Seven</span>, <span class="dlf">Side A</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3170"> Beginning of Tape Seven, <span class="dlf">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3171">Q: This is tape two, side B, of an interview with <span class="populated place">Ermest Fontheim</span>, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3172">A: So we finally emerged from there and there was not a soul around. </sentence><sentence id="3173">Then we went back into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and there was a tremendous shout of relief. </sentence><sentence id="3174">Apparently, <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, somebody must have seen the Russian soldier pointing his gun at me, so the rumor had spread that both of us had been shot. </sentence><sentence id="3175">And -- so when we appeared alive, obviously the joy was great. </sentence><sentence id="3176">So then, finally came the first of May, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3177">And the first of May, of course, is a big Russian holiday, a Soviet holiday and -- and it was for the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3178">By that time, things had sort of quieted down a little bit, although not too much and a large group of soldiers visited us. </sentence><sentence id="3179">It somehow spread around that Margaret's father, who was in general very handy, was also very good in some simple sort of dressing up wounds and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3180">And we had, of course for our own purposes, all kinds of medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="3181">And there were some soldiers who had, I don't know what it was any more, some open flesh wounds flumow and anyway, he treated them. </sentence><sentence id="3182">And then there was also a <span class="spatial object">piano</span> around for some reason and he played the <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and to celebrate them, he played the s- song, "The Internationale," which is the sort of international Communist party song. </sentence><sentence id="3183">And that made them all very happy and -- and they became sort of somewhat friendly and then one -- I remember one soldier, he was a -- a giant of a guy, pulling out of a -- a dirty pocket, some equally dirty photographs of -- were obviously family pictures. </sentence><sentence id="3184">Wife, children or something. </sentence><sentence id="3185">And  52 with -- with tears streaming down his face, he said they were all killed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3186">And -- and then after awhile, they said they needed all of the women to co-come along. </sentence><sentence id="3187">And then so obviously we were very uneasy about that and then we said, you know, what they wanted -- I mean there was very difficult communication, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="3188">None of us spoke Russian and they only knew sort of a s-smattering of some German words. </sentence><sentence id="3189">Anyway, it turned out they had nearby, sort of a -- some battalion or regiment camped and to prepare for their meal, they needed people to peel potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="3190">And so we immediately, all of u -- males, volunteered to go and so they took the women and the men along to about, I don't know, it wasn't far away, a quarter of a mile or so, where they were camped and put us down and they had piles and piles of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="3191">And so we -- we peeled potatoes for them. </sentence><sentence id="3192">And in fact they had discovered apparently somewhere, a <span class="building">storage shed</span> that was full with potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="3193">And one <span class="dlf">d</span> -- and they needed more from there. </sentence><sentence id="3194">One of the Russian soldiers took Margaret's father along to help him carry them in a-- in a <span class="spatial object">sack</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="3195">And when they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> of the <span class="building">shed</span>, the first thing, before they even saw the potatoes, there was a dead German woman lying. </sentence><sentence id="3196">So the soldiers just -- soldier kicked her away with his foot and said something like "Kaput," which is a German word for broken. </sentence><sentence id="3197">And then they gathered the potatoes and -- and -- and brought them back. </sentence><sentence id="3198">And -- and then we peeled potatoes and then we were actually taken back by them. </sentence><sentence id="3199">Oh, while we -- while we -- while we peeled the potatoes, they had accordion players there, they -- they played the accordion and sang songs, so for awhile it became even somewhat romantic and they also gave us some meat dishes to eat, which was hearty and -- even if not exactly gourmet style, but we were always hungry in those days and would have eaten anything. </sentence><sentence id="3200">And -- and then we were taken back by them again, to the -- to the <span class="building">orangery</span> where we all stayed. </sentence><sentence id="3201">But I mean, there were also, still, less pleasant incidents and robberies and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3202">So a day or two later, I decided that we need really, some  53 more firm protection, that by now, since the <span class="populated place">city</span>, there was no more fighting, even nearby, there must be a <span class="populated place">city</span> commander. </sentence><sentence id="3203">And so I-I-I got up -- out, and said that I will try to find where the commander is and see whether we can get some protection. </sentence><sentence id="3204">And of course I had no idea wh -- th- the <span class="populated place">city</span> picture was totally changed. </sentence><sentence id="3205">You know, a few days before, the last time I walked in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, it was full with Nazi party uniforms, SS, <span class="building">Vairmarkt</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="3206">All of that has vanished as if swallowed up by the <span class="env feature">earth</span> and all one saw was Russian uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="3207">And the traffic was -- the <span class="building">traffic police</span>, they were all women, usually very hefty looking women. </sentence><sentence id="3208">Their most prominent feature, they were all unbelievably heavily bosomed and they carried two sort of colored sticks, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3209">I think one red, one yellow, which they waved in some prescribed form, with the left hand and with the right hand, indicating which direction could move and which had to halt. </sentence><sentence id="3210">And actually they did it in a very snappy, military fashion. </sentence><sentence id="3211">I enjoyed actually looking on, just seeing them perform these duties. </sentence><sentence id="3212">Now, in the meantime, in order to f-find the -- where the commandant -- the <span class="building">commandature</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="3213">Commandature is a Russian word actually, meaning the <span class="building">command office</span> for the -- for the <span class="populated place">city</span> commander. </sentence><sentence id="3214">And I was always pointed in some direction, so I just kept going in the direction that I was pointed at, until I arrived in front of a huge <span class="building">villa</span> and that <span class="building">villa</span> was beleaguered by a huge -- by, actually by two huge throngs. </sentence><sentence id="3215">As I found out in a minute, one were Germans and the other one were foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="3216">Practically all of them false laborers who had been deported to <span class="country">Germany</span> and who obviously went there for help in trying to get back to their home countries. </sentence><sentence id="3217">There were Frenchmen, Belgians, Poles, e-e-everyone. </sentence><sentence id="3218">And -- and the other throng were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3219">The one person I remember was a German medical officer, who was in charge of the local <span class="building">military hospital</span> where -- I mean the Russians left him in charge -- these were all soldiers with fairly heavy wounds. </sentence><sentence id="3220">He came to complain that his nurses were being constantly raped and therefore could not fulfill their duties to the patients. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And I decided immediately not to  54 identify myself with the Germans, so I stood with the foreign laborers. </sentence><sentence id="3222">Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention also, we had -- when we left that <span class="populated place">village</span> overnight, we had taken along also, all our real identifications, so that -- because obviously we knew the war would end within days or weeks, that we could then establish our true identities. </sentence><sentence id="3223">And, among other things I also had saved my Jewish star, which I then put on. </sentence><sentence id="3224">And as I said -- and I -- I waited there together with all the foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="3225">And so it was of course a slow process. </sentence><sentence id="3226">So finally it was my turn, I was ushered in and was in some sort of a <span class="interior space">front room</span>, <span class="interior space">entry room</span> or <span class="interior space">waiting room</span>, whatever and was told to wait and then one, from -- behind it, apparently, was a real <span class="building">office</span> and then one officer came and took a look at me with that star and sort of shouted something in Russian to the back and then an officer with sort of more stars and so on, who seemed to be the commander, came out. </sentence><sentence id="3227">He was sort of a short, stocky, heavy-set guy. </sentence><sentence id="3228">Took one look at me and -- and then asked me in fairly good German, "You are a Jew?" </sentence><sentence id="3229">And I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3230">And then he -- he ran toward me, embraced me and -- and told, sorry -- told me that I was the first Jew whom he -- whom he saw in -- in weeks or months. </sentence><sentence id="3231">There was n-no Jew left anywhere... Okay, then he -- he asked me in his <span class="building">office</span> and sit down and told me that, to tell him how come that I wasn't killed. </sentence><sentence id="3232">So I briefly told him what had happened to me and -- and also that I was actually together with a family of friends and that we needed some personal protection and then he -- he told me I should, as soon as possible, bring the whole family, he wants to meet them. </sentence><sentence id="3233">Oh, and -- and of course, I forgot, his name was Major Shike and of course, he was a Jew himself... So yeah, the only thing then at there, before I left, he asked me, he said he -- he wants to keep my yellow star as a souvenir. </sentence><sentence id="3234">So I gladly gave that to him. </sentence><sentence id="3235">And then I went back and I forgot, either the same day or the next day, all four of us went there and met Major Shike again and he award us a piece of paper in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="3236">That one was not thrown away by anyone, in fact I still have it among my souvenirs and in fact I never knew  55 what it really said and of course, with the Russian immigration to this <span class="country">country</span> here during the last decade or so, we also -- we made some Russian friends in <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span> and I had that guy translate it to me, for the first time -- what, 40 years after Major Shike gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And it -- it simply said that every possible protection is give -- to be given to the Jackass -- fact he ordered in one word, I guess he didn't realize that it was a first and a last name, family and -- and also that we are supposed to be supplied generously with food. </sentence><sentence id="3238">Oh, yeah, he told us also that the Soviet army was soon going to start handing out food to the population and they will be very small, restricted rations, you know, like so many crumbs of bread and this and that. </sentence><sentence id="3239">And so there will also be long <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3240">But with that piece of paper, first of all, we did not have to stand in <span class="dlf">line</span>, but we could right away go to the <span class="spatial object">counter</span> and also, we -- we should buy whatever we thought or needed to buy. </sentence><sentence id="3241">And regardless of what the official rations are. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And you can imagine the pride we -- after years of being always kicked to the back, now we could go to the <span class="region">front</span> and the Germans had to stay behind and wait. </sentence><sentence id="3243">And so that went on for -- I mean then our -- our life go-got much better and we were not molested any more. </sentence><sentence id="3244">But the next thing was of course, we wanted to get back to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And so I guess we had to find out whether there is a <span class="dlf">suburban railroad line</span> going from <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3246">And so I suggested, I-I wrote to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, which was also several miles -- that <span class="building">castle</span> was somewhat out of <span class="populated place">town</span>, of <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3247">And to check the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and where the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> are going. </sentence><sentence id="3248">And when I got to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, it was an incredible picture of destruction. </sentence><sentence id="3249">Somebody should have painted or at least photographed it, but of course in those days we didn't have a camera and I don't have a talent for a painter. </sentence><sentence id="3250">But the -- the -- the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, there was hardly any <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span> that was standing on its wheels, they were lying on their sides, there were <span class="dlf">bomb craters</span> all over and one <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> apparently, must have been -- due to some force of some explosion, was standing on its heads wi -- on -- on the <span class="dlf">front end</span>, with  56 the <span class="spatial object">wheels</span> o-on the side, a totally grotesque picture. </sentence><sentence id="3251">And -- and wires were hanging and signal 1- lights were dangling down or overturned. </sentence><sentence id="3252">I mean you had to take one look and know not only that nothing is running now, but that nothing would be running for weeks probably or months or longer. </sentence><sentence id="3253">So I walked back to give that report and on the way back, along one of the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, I saw a sizable group of Germans, coming under guard by -- by two Russians, one Russian in front with a gun over the shoulder and one Russian behind. </sentence><sentence id="3254">And they were wearing not the usual army uniform. </sentence><sentence id="3255">I mean it looked similar to the army uniform, except that their military hats were green. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3256">And these were actually the NK VD troops, which -- they were the forerunner of what later became KGB. </sentence><sentence id="3257">And so I walked -- I mean I walked along and they came toward me and as they were -- as they were passed me, the soldier in front asked me for my papers. </sentence><sentence id="3258">And I-I had my Jewish ID and naively I thought, you know, the guy knows immediately that -- you know, it didn't say Jew, it just has a J printed on top of it. </sentence><sentence id="3259">And furthermore, of course it was in the Roman letters, which are used i-in German and not in Cyrillic, which the Russians use. </sentence><sentence id="3260">Anyway, he didn't even look at the -- at the ID, he took the ID, put it in his uniform pocket and -- and told me -- I guess there were only a few words he knew in German, one of them was com. </sentence><sentence id="3261">That means come. </sentence><sentence id="3262">And then I tried to tell him that <span class="populated place">Y-Yvrai</span> and he just waved me off. </sentence><sentence id="3263">So -- so then I suddenly found myself a prisoner of the <span class="building">NK VD</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And we walked for several <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and I noticed, it seemed totally random. </sentence><sentence id="3265">There were some Germans whom we let pass by and then again one he would take along. </sentence><sentence id="3266">I-I couldn't figure out what, if any -- principle governed his a -- and by now, having seen the Russians operate, I'm sure it was random, that there was no principle involved. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3267">So anyway, we finally stopped at a large <span class="building">villa</span>, which was -- had been confiscated by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3268">And on the side of the -- w-we walked over to the side. </sentence><sentence id="3269">On the side of the <span class="building">villa</span>, a <span class="spatial object">table</span> was set -- oh I'm sorry -- a <span class="spatial object">table</span> was set up and behind that <span class="spatial object">table</span>, there was a -- an officer, also  57 with a green hat, n-next to a civilian. </sentence><sentence id="3270">And -- and we were sort of lined up in -- in -- in front, on the other side of the <span class="spatial object">table</span> at a certain distance. </sentence><sentence id="3271">And then we were called up, one by one, to sit down -- there was one <span class="spatial object">chair</span> across from them, to sit down and being asked questions. </sentence><sentence id="3272">When it came to my turn -- and by the way, the officer, the interrogating officer looked exactly like a brutal SS man, except the uniform was different. </sentence><sentence id="3273">When it came to my turn, he asked -- the questions were asked by him in Russian, by the way and the civilian next to him was an interpreter, then he gave it to me in German. </sentence><sentence id="3274">And they were all very standard, harmless question. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3275">My name, my address, my father's name, that sort of thing, date of birth. </sentence><sentence id="3276">And after the last question, then he turned that thing that he had filled out, that sheet of paper, over to me and -- and asked me to sign at the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="3277">Now, not only was everything that he filled out and so on, in Cyrillic, but then there was a long paragraph below the filled out part, of text. </sentence><sentence id="3278">So I pushed that thing over to the interpreter and asked him politely to inter -- I wanted to know what I'm signing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3279">Interpret it to me. </sentence><sentence id="3280">But instead of translating it in -- into German, he told the officer that I wanted it translated. </sentence><sentence id="3281">And then the officer barked something that didn't sound very appealing to me and then the interpreter said, "He says," you know, "my boss says, if you don't sign it right away, he beat you to death right here on the spot." </sentence><sentence id="3282">So I signed it and was convinced at that time and somewhat even today still, that I probably signed that I volunteer to go to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And so then, an-and actually, a few of the people after that interrogation ended were sent <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3284">Others were not and of course I was in the latter group. </sentence><sentence id="3285">Then we were, after we were through with all of them, we were led around to the back and in the <span class="interior space">back yard</span> there was an air raid shelter <span class="dlf">ditch</span>, which the Germans had dug during the war, to protect, I mean, against air raids. </sentence><sentence id="3286">And what it was is, it's a <span class="dlf">ditch</span>, you know, about I would say, about three yards wide and about five feet -- five feet deep at most, maybe a little bit less. </sentence><sentence id="3287">And then over it was a sort of pre-  58 cast concrete sort of <span class="spatial object">arch</span> that extended the length of the <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3288">So an-and that pre-cast concrete arch then, would be covered, or was covered with <span class="env feature">earth</span> and something planted on it, so that it was camouflaged, but you could go in for protection of that against bombs or artillery and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3289">And they used it now as a <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Of course it was totally damp -- yeah and the-there were <span class="spatial object">benches</span> in there, but it was very damp and unpleasant. </sentence><sentence id="3291">And -- and then there was a guard with a gun at the <span class="dlf">exit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3292">And the only reason to -- for anyone to go out is, if somebody had to do some business and the guard who stood there knew only one German word, we were told and -- and that is shisin, which is the German slang word, actually the total equivalent of, in English, means shitting. </sentence><sentence id="3293">So -- what did -- if -- if somebody had to go, then they was taken out and what they had rigged up there is, between two <span class="env feature">trees</span>, they had fastened a horizontal broom, at about sitting height or <span class="spatial object">chair</span> height. </sentence><sentence id="3294">And you just had to sort of sit over that <span class="spatial object">broom</span>, holding on with your hands and do whatever you had to do and then go back again in-into that <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3295">And after a few hours, we were even brought some food. </sentence><sentence id="3296">It was in -- in a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>, which is used in <span class="country">Germany</span>, or I guess here too, for say, washing <span class="interior space">floors</span> and th-they had in there some nondescript soup, with a few pieces of meat sort of floating around in it... Yeah, then later that day, I mean that was all still in the morning and then we get something at noon, that -- that food and then the afternoon, somebody shouted down, "All Germans out." </sentence><sentence id="3297">Again, there were Germans and non-Germans that they had collected them and the non-Germans were al-always the forced laborers that the Germans had deported into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3298">But anyway, all Germans were called out and I immediately decided, you know, I'm not a German and so I stayed in there. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And they were actually taken out to peel potatoes for the Russians, you know it was a fairly large group of policemen and investigators and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And after they were finished, they were told, okay now they can go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3301">Then I thought I could hit myself over the head. </sentence><sentence id="3302">If I would have gone out with  59 the Germans, I would be out and free now. </sentence><sentence id="3303">Well, it was a wrong guess. </sentence><sentence id="3304">And then, the night came and we had to sort of <span class="spatial object">seat</span> -- sleep sitting up on that -- that <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, in -- in that damp atmosphere there, as well as one could and the next day, the next day the various people were called up for more interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="3305">Yeah and then I had sort of started up some sort of a talking acquaintanceship with a Czech engineer, who had been taken by the Germans to work on some <span class="building">war plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3306">And so he was called up and he -- he was brought down by the guard after whatever, maybe a half an hour and he was hardly down and had sat down and he looked already very disturbed, when another officer, who looked also extremely brutal, appeared with a -- he had sort of a baton and -- and a sort of wooden stick in front, i-in his hand, waved it in front of that Czech guy and shouted at him in Russian, something that didn't sound very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="3307">And when he was gone, the Czech guy told me that the Russians, during the interrogation, told him that they have evidence that he was not forcibly deported, but that he volunteered to work for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And of course he denied that and it wasn't true, he said. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And that guy who came down, shouted at him, "If you don't admit the truth, that you volunteer t-to work for the Germans, you'll stay down here until you starve of -- of -- of hunger." </sentence><sentence id="3310">And -- and th-then he told me yeah, I mean he -- he -- by the way, he knew Russian also, that Czech guy. </sentence><sentence id="3311">He told me -- you know I had told him a little bit about my story, that, "they probably won't believe that you are a Jew, either." </sentence><sentence id="3312">Anyway, later that day, be -- before I was even interrogated, we were all called out and marched off. </sentence><sentence id="3313">And I thought now actually, that we are headed toward someplace where we were being shipped off into the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3314">And I was sort of looking around, whether there would be a way, quick -- make a quick escape. </sentence><sentence id="3315">There was just -- there were two soldiers, one in front and one bringing up the rear, each one with a gun who -- and it would have had to be somewhere where, you know, they couldn't immedia -- anyway, it never came to that, we only walked about two or three  60 <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and then we were asked to sit down on the <span class="dlf">street</span> in front of an even bigger <span class="building">villa</span>, which was also occupied by these same green-hated soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3316">And then we were called up one by one into the <span class="building">building</span> for interrogation and some people actually, after they came out, left. </sentence><sentence id="3317">Apparently they were told to be free and others came back and joined us. </sentence><sentence id="3318">And when -- when I was called in, there were two interrogators and they struck me immediately, sort of totally different. </sentence><sentence id="3319">But see the Russians which I had come across so far, all were s-sort of looked pretty uncivilized and -- and -- and brutal in a sort of a raw way. </sentence><sentence id="3320">These two guys, they also looked brutal, but they were well shaved. </sentence><sentence id="3321">They looked brutal, maybe sounds funny to say, in the SS way. </sentence><sentence id="3322">They had elegant uniforms, they talked fluent German, they seemed to be very educated, but -- made a ruthless impression that way. </sentence><sentence id="3323">But -- anyway they --they wanted to know, you know, who I am, which I told them and then exactly as that Czech had predicted, they told me that they won't believe that I am Jewish and in fact that they have some evidence that I had -- was working under orders to blow up <span class="dlf">bridges</span> to delay the Russian advance and how I could prove that I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3324">And then I s -- I told them, well you have my papers, you know th-they confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="3325">Then they both laughed, indicating, you know, these days, anyone has forged papers, so. </sentence><sentence id="3326">And then I was sent down into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> of that <span class="building">villa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3327">The <span class="interior space">basement</span> was of course, <span class="interior space">concrete floor</span>, covered with a thin layer of straw and I was greeted there by a chorus of other Germans, "Ah, a-a new one coming in." </sentence><sentence id="3328">And of course, in lying there with those guys I found out one of them was th-the local Nazi party district leader, had sort of the same position as that guy that we had then. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And I- I said, sort of to myself, you know, what an irony, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3330">Here I am in <span class="building">prison</span> now, with guys like those, like that. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And -- and then we were also again fed some nondescript food and people were constantly being called up for interrogation <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3332">And then night fell and then the guard would periodically come into the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and shine a flashlight into people's faces, looking for a  61 particular individual and then gave in up and the next morning I was called up again and -- and the same two guys were there and they immediately took me und-under sharp questioning and said whether I had changed my mind and I'm willing to tell the truth now. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And I told them that I -- that I -- that is the truth and then one guy sort of walked up to me and said, "You know, I tell you one thing, we have more -- too many of your types of Jews in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, and they're - - you are all the same. </sentence><sentence id="3334">You don't want to work, but you want others to work. </sentence><sentence id="3335">You want other people to work for you. </sentence><sentence id="3336">If one thing, we'll teach you guys to -- how to work." </sentence><sentence id="3337">And then, with that he lifted his jack-booted foot and gave me a -- a powerful kick into my rear end, "Now get down." </sentence><sentence id="3338">And the guard took me down again. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And then other people were called up and I forgot whether there was a third night or not, but anyway, the next time I was called up, the guard who did the bringing up, came into the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, pulled his pistol a-and shouted into the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3340">Usually he called by name, now he shouted, "Where is the Jew?" </sentence><sentence id="3341">So I got up and he pulled his pistol and said, "You are going to be shot now." </sentence><sentence id="3342">An-And that d-didn't sound real to me, because they weren't shooting people there, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3343">And anyway, as I-I walked ahead of him, he sort of pressed the muzzle of his gun into my back, but somehow at that point I wasn't afraid, I-I-I-I sort of felt that was just a ruse. </sentence><sentence id="3344">And when I came up, there were these same two guys and they again asked me whether I had a change in mind and whether I'm ready to tell them the truth. </sentence><sentence id="3345">And I -- I said, "That is the truth." </sentence><sentence id="3346">And then -- then they asked, "Well, how could you prove that you are a Jew?" </sentence><sentence id="3347">So I-I said, "Well, I know some Hebrew." </sentence><sentence id="3348">So upon which one of them rattled something in -- in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="3349">Then -- then I said, "But that wasn't Hebrew, that was Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="3350">Then he said, "Oh? </sentence><sentence id="3351">What's the difference?" </sentence><sentence id="3352">So I explained the difference to him and then he smiled and then he said, "Well what -- what -- what do you -- what Hebrew do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="3353">You know, in -- in -- in that moment, the only thing I could think of was a Shema, which I recited. </sentence><sentence id="3354">And then  62 they both laughed and then it suddenly struck me, these guys are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3355">And -- and then they were just instantaneously switched, they were extremely polite, told me to sit down and I must be hungry after that ordeal and they -- they barked some orders at some guy outside. </sentence><sentence id="3356">And it was in five minutes he came with delicious rolls with s -- sausage and salami and -- and then we had a conversation, then he asked me what I want to do and I told him <span class="building">werwidden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3357">And then he said well okay, I-I should get out of there an-and -- and go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3358">Now the thing is this, on the day -- that all started when I was looking for the -- when I was looking for the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and I had a light coat on and that coat, of course I had left <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> in the -- in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3359">But during the days that I was down there, you know, you hear all kinds of stories, they were telling of -- of somebody who was released by the guys upstairs, who also had forgotten some personal belongings in -- in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and said he wants to retrieve it, but the guard had a change in mind, you know and -- and just told the guy he's not letting him out again, even though the officer <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="3360">So I figured, to hell with my <span class="spatial object">coat</span>, I am free and that's more important. </sentence><sentence id="3361">But of course, in those days, even a coat, a simple coat was a -- somewhat of a fortune, but my freedom was even more valuable. </sentence><sentence id="3362">I-I forgot to mention, by the way, that when, on the first day, when those Germans were asked to peel potatoes and then released, I managed to tell one of them the address where the Haas family were living there in the <span class="building">orangery</span> and to notify them where I am, because you know, they had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="3363">So when I came back, you know, they knew over there, that guy had actually notified them and they had gone to <span class="populated place">Major Shike</span>, you know, hoping that all that needs to be done, that he has to pull some strings to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And when they told him where I was, he immediately backed off and said, "Well, there's nothing that -- these guys knows wh -- know what they are doing," and he cannot interfere. </sentence><sentence id="3365">So, that's an interesting sidelight on the system, was exactly the way with the Gestapo in -- in -- in -- in -- in  63 <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="3366">Okay, so anyway, after all of that, we knew that no <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were running to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but that's where we wanted to get to. </sentence><sentence id="3367">And then -- in the meantime, our <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> of course, had been stolen by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3368">It was th -- after the watch, was the next thing. </sentence><sentence id="3369">So I couldn't even <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but I suggested that I walk to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, was about, I forgot, must be 25 miles or so. </sentence><sentence id="3370">And -- and go to the <span class="populated place">Templehoff district</span>, where I had that <span class="interior space">room</span> and sort of see what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="3371">So I walked there and right when I got there, I-I found out first of all, that the Russians had already instituted a German civilian administration and in the <span class="populated place">borough</span>, sort of <span class="populated place">city</span> or each -- yeah, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> has 20 <span class="populated place">boroughs</span>, you know, th-that <span class="populated place">borough</span> of <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span> where that <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was in, then had its own <span class="building">city hall</span> and so I went up there and I found out that they have lists o-0-of -- of Nazis, particularly Nazis who had more prominent positions. </sentence><sentence id="3372">And their <span class="interior space">apartments</span> are available for people who are returning from <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, that were persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="3373">So the guy told me that all I have to do is ask for a list and I can pick the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> I want to have. </sentence><sentence id="3374">And of course I didn't want to make a decision so I just stayed one night and then walked back again and then there's another one or two days and then I -- I walked with Margaret's father, Mr. Haas, to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3375">There we had a -- another incident, while we were walking on the -- this major <span class="dlf">highway</span>, I mean that also goes through suburban <span class="dlf">city streets</span> toward <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3376">We saw already at a distance -- there was a big <span class="building">hospital</span> there and -- and the Russians, you could see were busy there, carrying equipment out. </sentence><sentence id="3377">And -- but as we come closer, we could see that they were basically Russian guards and German civilians carrying equipment. </sentence><sentence id="3378">And so, as -- as we got there, the Russian guard immediately enlisted us to also help carry out equipment from the -- they were dismantling the entire <span class="building">hospital</span> and we had to go in and carry out whatever medical supplies and -- and so on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3379"> End of Tape Seven, Side B  64 Beginning of Tape Eight, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3380">Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with <span class="populated place">Ermest Fontheim</span>, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence><sentence id="3381">The interviewer is Randy Goldman. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3382">A: Yeah, so -- I mean, we were not exactly excited by this prospect, particularly since we figured if they need us here to load that <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, somewhere they must have a railroad sighting, where the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> then has to be unloaded into <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> and we didn't want to be taken there. </sentence><sentence id="3383">Now again I had really a unbelievable stroke of luck. </sentence><sentence id="3384">It turns out that one of the nurses in that <span class="building">hospital</span>, was a nurse who at one time, my grandmother had -- I forgot for what reason my grandmother was paralyzed toward the last years of her life. </sentence><sentence id="3385">Anyway, she knew me and she knew our family. </sentence><sentence id="3386">And so I-I told -- we had a chance to chat and then she told us to -- when we ca -- to bring down now whatever we were taking dow -- told to take down and when we come up, to see her in a certain <span class="interior space">room</span> number. </sentence><sentence id="3387">So that's where we went and then she conducted us to some <span class="interior space">rear staircase</span>, in the rear of the <span class="building">building</span>, that the Russians apparently hadn't been aware of, and which let out some <span class="dlf">rear door</span> to a side <span class="dlf">street</span>, away from that main <span class="dlf">highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3388">And then she told us to walk down that <span class="dlf">street</span>, several <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and then turn right and to come back again to the main <span class="dlf">highway</span>, but sort of out of sight of those g-guards there. </sentence><sentence id="3389">So that's what we did, so. </sentence><sentence id="3390">And -- okay, then we continued and then when we came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I went with my -- with Margaret's father to the -- to the <span class="building">city office</span>, where I had been a few days before and we were give -- given the list and then we started to look at one or two <span class="interior space">apartments</span> and actually liked one. </sentence><sentence id="3391">There -- there was a mother, who was, I guess she must have been probably around late 30's, maybe around 40, with two relatively small children, maybe sort of around, maybe, a young teenager, I think a boy around 13 and a girl a few years younger. </sentence><sentence id="3392">And, you know, we identified ourselves as -- that we are Jews and that the  65 Nazis had taken everything we -- away. </sentence><sentence id="3393">Oh yeah, by the way, I'm sorry, I have to back up. </sentence><sentence id="3394">The official in the <span class="building">city hall</span> also told us that the people, I mean, who -- <span class="interior space">apartments</span> are vacated, are not permitted to take anything with them, unless we give special permission. </sentence><sentence id="3395">And t -- Margaret's father sort of conducted the conversation and he told her that we are, of course, not like the Nazis and any personal, I mean we don't want her clothing or -- or that of other family members and -- or personal items, but all furnishings, all kitchen utensils and those things, have to stay in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3396">And -- and to do it sort of on an honor code and we'll be back the next morning to claim the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3397">So that's what we did, we came back the next morning, got a set of keys and -- and then took possession of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3398">And then I-I think through Major Shike or somehow, we got a <span class="spatial object">Russian military truck</span> to take us along, who was going to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> anyway, also with all our luggage. </sentence><sentence id="3399">I mean you couldn't have -- yeah, I-I mean I-I-I skipped several things, you know, when -- when I say I discussed, when we suddenly had to leave that <span class="populated place">village</span> there overnight and we hid all our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> in the <span class="building">shed</span> of this elderly couple, Dwuzul. </sentence><sentence id="3400">I don't -- I don't know whether I mentioned their name, but their name is Dwuzul anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3401">And I picked those up by meeting them at a certain <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3402">So we had all our things with us by that time. </sentence><sentence id="3403">And of course there was no way how we could have gotten to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, you know, with all that stuff if we -- so anyway, that's how we got to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3404">And then one sort of interesting after development, I-I had discussed, quite a bit earlier, the former client of my father, who was also a furrier and where I went to work once a week on his <span class="dlf">estate</span>, so long, as a gardener in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3405">And I mentioned that he had three Polish forced laborers there. </sentence><sentence id="3406">A Polish couple and then a single woman, Maria, who always, every time I came, invited me to her <span class="interior space">room</span> and fed me and gave me food along. </sentence><sentence id="3407">And -- and who I sort of suspected that she might have a crush on me. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Well, when I visited the <span class="building">furrier</span> [indecipherable] after the war, he told me an amazing story, he said when the  66 Russians came, you know and he lived, of course in an <span class="region">area</span> of big <span class="building">mansions</span> and they were going everywhere just emptying places out -- Maria went and sort of got a hold of the first Russian officer and had a long conversation in Russian with him. </sentence><sentence id="3409">As a result of which, the officer ordered all his -- his troops away from this <span class="building">house</span> and -- and on and he was, nothing happened to his place. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And then he -- he asked Maria, "What -- what did you tell him?" </sentence><sentence id="3411">And, "I-I told him that you are one of the few decent Germans, that you helped enemies of the regime and Jews." </sentence><sentence id="3412">And then he said, ""What -- what Jews did I help?" </sentence><sentence id="3413">Well, you know, I went -- I think I mentioned I went there also under an assumed name. </sentence><sentence id="3414">And the name I used there, by the way, was Tsarini. </sentence><sentence id="3415">There was some reason for that, but doesn't make a difference here. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And -- and she said, "Wasn - - Wasn't Tsarini Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="3417">And he laughed and said, "Of course he was, but how did you know?" </sentence><sentence id="3418">Then she said, "I know because I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3419">My name is not Maria at all. </sentence><sentence id="3420">I -- I got Polish papers. </sentence><sentence id="3421">It was better to be deported to <span class="country">Germany</span> for forced labor than to some <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and I-I immediately recognize a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="3422">And -- and when he told me the story, I felt really dumb. </sentence><sentence id="3423">That is -- that never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="3424">And I often wondered what became of Maria, or whatever her real name is. </sentence><sentence id="3425">Well, it's an interesting sidelight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3470">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="3471">At what point did you start hearing about all of the atrocities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3474">A: Oh yeah, okay. </sentence><sentence id="3475">In a -- we heard from British broadcasting, BBC, that we occasionally -- yeah, the -- the -- we -- we had a chance to listen to BBC at the <span class="building">house</span> of this elderly couple, the Dwuzuls, you know, who -- later were insulted that we hadn't informed them earlier who we were, because they -- we had even before that, when we still pretended to be good German Aryans, we had often been at their <span class="building">house</span> listening to foreign broadcasts, mainly BBC, actually, with them. </sentence><sentence id="3476">And in fact I have to say that -- that was a big morale booster, just to listen to the BBC. </sentence><sentence id="3477">They did a lot for us just by having these broadcasts and -- and they -- their signal was  67 always -- it started out with the Morse Code signal for the letter V, for victory and -- and by coincidence, these are also the first tacts of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. </sentence><sentence id="3478">And -- and just listening to -- to this signal was already a big morale booster. </sentence><sentence id="3479">And of course we heard all kinds of stories, that the Nazis kept from the population. </sentence><sentence id="3480">And of course, as I had also said before, that was punishable by execution if they found out someone was listening to foreign radio broadcasts. </sentence><sentence id="3481">So in a way, the Dwuzuls had a point, you know, they were totally in our hand, you know, we -- we listened to these broadcasts there with them at their <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3490">Q: No, my question was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3492">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3494">Q: After you -- you were with the Russians, did people start streaming back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3496">A: Oh, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3498">Q: Did you start hearing stories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3500">A: No, not -- I mean, all I was going to say -- that come from -- from Brit -- from <span class="building">BBC</span> we heard for the first time, I think maybe I said that before already, that hundreds of thousands of Jews are being killed. </sentence><sentence id="3501">Then -- no, i-it -- it took quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="3502">Actually, people slowly dribbled in. </sentence><sentence id="3503">There was a central registration place for Jews right after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3504">In fact, that was at the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span>, which was the last, sort of collection center for Jews for deportation. </sentence><sentence id="3505">Then it was turned over and -- and then was the first place where Jews could -- free Jews could collect again. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And -- but since there was no <span class="spatial object">public transport</span>, that was at the opposite end of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3507"><span class="building">Templehoff</span> was in the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and that <span class="building">hospital</span> in the <span class="region">northern part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3508">It was a long walk of many miles. </sentence><sentence id="3509">I went there once a week, hoping to see a -- a well known name, but -- but didn't discover anyone. </sentence><sentence id="3510">The -- the first person who returned, whom I knew, from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, was a <span class="building">high school</span> friend of mine, who in fact later also came to this <span class="country">country</span> and was then, before his retirement, a  68 professor of mathematics at <span class="building">Ohio State University</span> in <span class="populated place">Columbus</span>, and -- where he is living now. </sentence><sentence id="3511">But he -- he was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and he came back and he told me basically, a lot of the things also, a lot of the things that Elie Wiesel discussed in his book, "Night." </sentence><sentence id="3512">An-and -- I mean sort of, I mean the -- the fact that millions of Jews had been systematically killed, I mean it -- because then also other Jews came back, not just German Jews, also east European Jews who were chased out then, from their own <span class="country">countries</span>, mainly from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3513">As you may know, there were pogroms in <span class="country">Poland</span> against the returning Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3514">And so, I don't know how soon we found out, but within maybe weeks or months, we found out, although I mean, the total extent of it probably might have taken longer, I-I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3530">Q: But the stories -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3532">A: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3534">Q: How bad it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3536">A: Yeah, right -- that -- that came out. </sentence><sentence id="3537">I-I-I would like to make a few sort of post-script comments concerning the period of time before the start of World War Two. </sentence><sentence id="3538">Because I-I remember you had also asked me a question, you know, how that time affected me, at that time I was just a teenager and of course the Nazis were then in power, since 1933. </sentence><sentence id="3539">And what I would like to say is, that there was an increasing atmosphere, sort of -- of -- of hostility against the Jews in -- in all -- in the media, in p -- in -- in <span class="spatial object">newspapers</span>, in -- in the radio and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3540">And -- and we were, I mean, th-that I know I discussed also -- pictured as the worst criminals and as a --a sort of tr-trying to undermine the <span class="country">German nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3541">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3542">For example, one incident in -- in the <span class="building">apartment building</span> where we lived, the -- the beautiful one where we had that large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, there were only two parties on each <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3543">And on the same <span class="interior space">floor</span> there was another couple, the husband was also a lawyer, but they were Aryans, I mean Germans and they had a daughter, just one, single  69 child, a daughter my sister's age. </sentence><sentence id="3544">And the grandmother, one of the grandmother also lived with them. </sentence><sentence id="3545">And my sister and that girl were very close friends, they played together, and of course they went to <span class="building">school</span> together then, when they came to <span class="building">school</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3546">And one day the girl told my sister that her grandmother had forbade her from now on, to have a Jewish friend. </sentence><sentence id="3547">So she is sorry, but she can't come over any more and can't have her over. </sentence><sentence id="3548">You know, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3549">Then, each <span class="building">apartment building</span> was assigned a Nazi party, sort of representative for that <span class="building">building</span> and the man who was the representative in our <span class="building">building</span>, for example, made it a point, whenever we crossed <span class="dlf">paths</span>, see, in the <span class="building">house</span> entrance, in the <span class="spatial object">elevator</span> or wherever, to ostensibly sort of look in a very hostile way and ignoring us, not greeting us. </sentence><sentence id="3550">And a few other tenant, not all of them, but a few other tenants followed suit. </sentence><sentence id="3551">Then, as the 30's wore on and the Nazis really started openly to prepare for war, they also started an extensive air raid protection system, with building <span class="building">air raid shelters</span> in <span class="interior space">basements</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3552">And one of the early orders was that Jews are not permitted to join the other tenants in an <span class="building">air raid shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3553">So we had to go -- ea-each tenant also had a little <span class="dlf">lockable area</span>, sort of separated by -- by wooden planks, to store things, for storage. </sentence><sentence id="3554">And we had to sit in there like pariahs, while the rest of the tenants walked by there into their <span class="building">air raid shelter</span>, which was, you know with <span class="spatial object">benches</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3555">And there was -- I mean there were constant speeches, of course, which were insulting and hostile to us and -- and people, even people who were not ill-meaning, felt that it was dangerous even, to be seen -- to associate with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3556">And then there were, they had frequent Nazi holidays or other holidays. </sentence><sentence id="3557">They u -- every opportunity they -- then there were the Olympic games and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3558">And o-of each time they made a big fuss about marches. </sentence><sentence id="3559">That -- that was sort of one of their favorite activities. </sentence><sentence id="3560"><span class="building">SS units</span>, <span class="building">SA units</span>, <span class="building">Hitler youth units</span>, would march, you know, looking really snappy and snifty, with flags flying and with bands playing and singing their songs. </sentence><sentence id="3561">And it was sort of, in retrospect, almost  70 like a -- almost continuous holiday atmosphere and by that time of course, as the 30's went on, everybody was employed. </sentence><sentence id="3562">You know, <span class="country">Germany</span> had a tremendous unemployment rate before, as part of the world wide great depres-depression. </sentence><sentence id="3563">And of course they were all employed, basically re-arming <span class="country">Germany</span>, but we didn't know it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3564">But, I mean, that was the thi -- that's -- that's how they solved the unemployment problem and also their own military, what they conceived as inferiorit-inferiority, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3594">Q: You mentioned the Olympics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3596">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3598">Q: Did you go to any of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3600">A: Yeah, well actually, I went to two events. </sentence><sentence id="3601">I went -- one was the final for the gold medal of soccer. </sentence><sentence id="3602">I went with my mother, she -- my mother was very interested in sports, my father couldn't have cared less. </sentence><sentence id="3603">So she went with me and the final game was between <span class="country">Italy</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> and it was a very exciting game, they were, at that time, the <span class="building">power houses</span> in -- in -- in soccer. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3604">And actually <span class="country">Germany</span> also had a pretty good team, but was already out of the running by that time. </sentence><sentence id="3605">And what happened is the -- at that time of course, <span class="country">Austria</span> was still an independent country, otherwise they wouldn't have had a team. </sentence><sentence id="3606">And -- but the Germans of course, felt kinship with the Austrians, so the -- the <span class="building">stadium</span> sort of rooted for the -- for the Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="3607">The Italians had bought, sort of <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, large <span class="dlf">blocks</span> of <span class="spatial object">seats</span>, where they were sitting in their black Fascist uniforms and were waving Italian flags and they must have had some sort of a cheerleader. </sentence><sentence id="3608">They would -- at -- at some particular moment, maybe when <span class="country">Italy</span> was on a <span class="dlf">drive</span>, they would jump up, like on a command and shout, I mean in Italian, "<span class="country">Italia</span>, <span class="country">Italia</span>, <span class="country">Italia</span>," and waving their flags. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3609">And then the rest of the <span class="building">stadium</span> would thunder back, "Ustarashe, Ustarashe," is the German word for <span class="country">Austria</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="3610"><span class="populated place">Ustarashe</span>, <span class="building">Ustarashe</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3611">So it was that constant back and forth between these  71 <span class="dlf">blocks</span> of Italians who shouted <span class="country">Italia</span> and most of the rest of the <span class="building">stadium</span> shouting Ustarashe. </sentence><sentence id="3612">And </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3613">Q: Was that alarming at all or was it exciting? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3614">A: No, th-that was an excite -- that was an excite -- excite, I mean of course there were political undertones, but I mean, <span class="country">Italy</span> was, by that time already, an ally of <span class="country">Germany</span>, so there was no, it wasn't as if say <span class="country">Britain</span> had been, you know then the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3626">A: Yeah IJ-I mean that was, I mean, incredible. </sentence><sentence id="3627">First of all, they -- they toned down somewhat, their antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="3628">That was probably on pressure from the <span class="region">west</span>, although there wasn't much of that pressure as far as I can see. </sentence><sentence id="3629">But the whole <span class="populated place">city</span> was sort of -- was first of all renovated. </sentence><sentence id="3630">The -- the -- the <span class="dlf">elevated lines</span> got totally new <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3631">You know, it's that <span class="dlf">line</span> that ran by that <span class="building">synagogue</span> also, that was burned down a few years later. </sentence><sentence id="3632">And -- and in fact those -- those <span class="spatial object">cars</span> are still in use now, that is now 60 years later. </sentence><sentence id="3633">Unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="3634">I mean now they -- they look worn and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3635">And -- and several <span

of their way and -- and the interesting -- when I came to this <span class="country">country</span>, and went to <span class="building">college</span> here, in the year 1949, so that was only 13 years

in "36 to the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="3643">At that time she was a young, I don't know, whatever, assistant professor or something and -- and she said she was impressed -- the -- the

the-they -- it -- it's fairly hard for people to understand. </sentence><sentence id="3645">I mean y -- you can -- you could, even SS officers and sometimes the most brutal types, could be very charming and courteous and polite and they were all double faced and -- so the Olympic games, from that point of view, were a huge success, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="3646">And of course, also, <span class="country">Germany</span> did very well, I mean the Nazis had a tremendous system of physical training and -- and <span class="building">sports facilities</span> and so on and I think in medals they won that game, far -- at least they claimed to, I forgot the details. </sentence><sentence id="3647">But anyway, coming back to that soccer game, they -- the way soccer was played at that time at least, it was a draw at the official end of the game and I think it was one to one. </sentence><sentence id="3648">And then the rule was that the game is extended until sudden death. </sentence><sentence id="3649">In other words, one party shoots a <span class="dlf">goal</span> and that ends the game and that party of course then wins. </sentence><sentence id="3650">And -- And it was <span class="country">Italy</span> that shot that additional goal, so it was two to one for <span class="country">Italy</span>, and they got the gold medal and the Austrians got the silver then.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3682">Q: [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Why don't you continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3686">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3687">Incidentally, the Olympics was the first occasion when I saw Hitler in person. </sentence><sentence id="3688">We -- we lived -- the <span class="dlf">street</span> we lived on in that <span class="building">ap-apartment</span> was the major east - west sort of <span class="dlf">boulevard</span>, that cut through, it started at the center of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, actually near the <span class="building">Rice chancellery</span> and then went for several miles, to the <span class="region">western outskirts</span> where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="3689">And the <span class="building">Olympic stadium</span> was also near where we lived, so Hitler passed by there on -- on opening day to open the games. </sentence><sentence id="3690">And of course, his trip out to the <span class="building">Olympic stadium</span> itself, was planned as a big <span class="building">theater</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3691">They had the <span class="dlf">streets</span> lined with enthusiastic crowds and SS, sort of in -- information, holding them back. </sentence><sentence id="3692">And then Hitler would ride in an open <span class="spatial object">Mercedes-Benz</span>, in uniform, standing stiffly upright and periodically raising his right arm to the Hitler salute, greeting the masses. </sentence><sentence id="3693">And as I stood on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span>, just looking straight down at Hitler, the thought occurred to me how easy it would be just to assassinate him from here. </sentence><sentence id="3694">The next time I saw him, was exact -- about a year later, when Mussolini played his state visit to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in 1937. </sentence><sentence id="3695">And in fact, during that state visit, the <span class="populated place">Berlin- Rome</span> axis was sort of cemented. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And Mussolini, the arrangement was also for them to ride into <span class="populated place">town</span>, so in the opposite direction now, from the -- from a <span class="building">suburban railroad station</span>, which was in fact just half a mile away from where our <span class="building">house</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="3697">And then they rode into <span class="populated place">town</span>, again greeting the masses that were lined up behind rows of <span class="building">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3698">And there was an interesting contrast. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3699">Hitler, the unsmiling, stiff despot and Mussolini, the typical, jovial Italian. </sentence><sentence id="3700">He also raised his hand, but he raised it in a much more informal way. </sentence><sentence id="3701">He -- his mouth was widely open and -- and laughing and smiling and his body would sort of -- in body language, wave back and forth from one side to the other, acknowledging crowds on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="3702">Was a tremendous difference in the  74 appearance of these two dictators. </sentence><sentence id="3703">I'm not trying to make Mussolini appear any -- like a nice uncle, but there was a tremendous difference between these two men, both were equally brutal. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3704">In -- in summary, I mean, I-I must say that I -- th-the years in the 30's, leading up to World War Two and the Holocaust, I felt, I mean basically like an outsider, like b-being, I mean pushed away from the main body and from all the festivities that the Germans enjoyed, from which I was excluded. </sentence><sentence id="3705">But on the other hand, I had found my inner Jewish belonging, mainly as a result of the <span class="building">school</span> that I went to and which gave me inner strength and to some extent compensated for that. </sentence><sentence id="3706">One final remark I would like to make concerning the question of the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="3707">The deportations of course, were ordered by the Gestapo and go back directly to an order by Heidrish, who was ordered by Hitler, was given by Hitler the -- the order to carry this out. </sentence><sentence id="3708">But the -- at the <span class="region">local level</span>, the deportations were organized by the Jewish community organizations. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3709">And of course that has been a big problem ever since it happened. </sentence><sentence id="3710">For -- for me personally, I felt -- first of all, totally abandoned, I must say, by the -- knowing that the Jewish organizations were organizing the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3711">Infer it got to the point where I actually considered the leadership of the <span class="building">Ricefinegunk</span> -- that was the sort of umbrella organization of Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> -- I considered them as part of the enemy and they had to be considered that way. </sentence><sentence id="3712">On the other hand, of course, we know now much more, there were very difficult moral decisions and there were very difficult also, options available. </sentence><sentence id="3713">I certainly would never want to be in a position to make those choices. </sentence><sentence id="3714">But it -- but th-th-th-the fact remains that for me at the time, I -- I felt really as being abandoned by my own leadership and -- and -- and it -- it probably needs to be considered more deeply now, where we have some distance, what the options were that these people had and what they could have done, other than what they actually did. </sentence><sentence id="3715"> 75 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3716">Q: I'm wondering how long you remained in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, what your plans were and how easy or difficult it was to realize those plans. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3717">A: Yeah, briefly, my first priority was to get on with my education and I immediately enrolled in the <span class="building">technical university</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and then later took courses also in the main <span class="building">university</span>, or <span class="building">Humboldt University</span>, as that was then renamed, li -- taking lectures in mathematics, physics and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3718">There were many famous professors who had still survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="3719">And of course there -- there were then also a number of Jews who had returned, or some of them actually had survived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> as -- as mixed -- children of mixed marriages. </sentence><sentence id="3720">You know, where one parent was Gentile and the other one was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3721">And of course there was a large number of German army veterans. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3722">And that in fact, was a very sore point. </sentence><sentence id="3723">Many of them were still very nationalistic, in spite of that hu-huge defeat. </sentence><sentence id="3724">So I-I-I enrolled in those courses and actually Margaret's mother immediately opened a sort of <span class="building">office</span>, on her own, for social help for Jews returning from <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3725">And she worked closely together with the American official who was in charge of that <span class="populated place">borough</span>, <span class="populated place">Templehoff</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3726">A -- I think a captain or major Davidhoff, or Davidhoff. </sentence><sentence id="3727">It turns out supposedly, that that man was a Communist and was then later rotated out and sent <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3728">And when -- when the first possibility arose for emigrating to the <span class="country">United States</span>, that was in "46 and we registered, it turned out that Margaret's mother somehow was on the black list, because she had closely collaborated, and that Major Davidho-Davidhoff also for example, was helpful in providing <span class="interior space">apartments</span> for returning Jews and etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="3729">And so we were, for about a year, subjected to a lot of chicanery by the <span class="building">American consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3730">I remember th-the consul himself was a Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3731">Haney and -- who was a very unpleasant character and I was once, I'm sure on -- on his orders, although I can't prove it, interrogated by an officer of the <span class="building">CIC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3732">The <span class="building">CIC</span> is the army's <span class="building">criminal investigation commission</span> or some -- and -- and that interrogation took place in the following  76 way, that the interrogating officer sat behind a <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and next to him was a growling German Shepherd, who was there just to intimidate me and they wanted to know, you know, about I -- wanted me to incriminate Margaret's parents, basically, as -- as Communists. </sentence><sentence id="3733">And -- you know and when I -- when I couldn't say anything incriminating, you know he -- he let me go, finally. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3734">But he -- it was a very unpleasant interview, or interrogation is the better word. </sentence><sentence id="3735">I did receive, finally, my visa, but the Haas family did not and at that point, since we had lived through thick and thin through the war, I decided to let my visa lapse, even though I was told by the -- and I told the consul I will go when the others will go. </sentence><sentence id="3736">The consul said that there's no guarantee that I will ever get my visa renewed if I let it lapse once. </sentence><sentence id="3737">And -- and I had an uncle here in the <span class="country">United States</span> who also implored me to -- to come -- to come and let -- wait here for them. </sentence><sentence id="3738">Anyway -- by the way, that's a interesting thing, my -- my first connection to -- to friends, you know there was no postal connection, of course, between <span class="country">Germany</span> and any <span class="country">country</span> outside. </sentence><sentence id="3739">So we went to -- there was a huge <span class="building">barracks</span> of American soldiers near where we lived and I remember I went to the guard soldier outside and asked whether he could tell me whether there was a Jewish soldier somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3740">It's such an outlandish idea. </sentence><sentence id="3741">So -- so he directed me, pointed to some particular <span class="interior space">room</span> and there was a Sergeant Roth, R-o-t-h. So I went to that Roth and told him who I was and that I survived and -- and I had a-an address of a <span class="building">school</span> friend in <span class="region">Connecticut</span> and my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="3742">And -- and -- and actually I didn't -- he was in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, but I didn't have his exact address, but I had some connecting address in <span class="populated place">London</span>, who could then forward it. </sentence><sentence id="3743">And -- and so he also conversed with me, that Roth and he -- he asked me where -- he -- no, he didn't ask me, he warned me not to try to emigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span> because there are -- were already too many Jews there and -- and was rising antisemitism and now that the Nazis were gone and the war was over, it would be much better for me also if I stayed in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3744">And I found that so unbelievably  77 preposterous, he was an American Jew, telling me not to come here. </sentence><sentence id="3745">But anyway, I didn't follow his advice, but what he did do, is he di -- he did forward my mail and the letter that I read to my <span class="building">school</span> friend, wound up as an article, he submitted it -- there's a German-Jewish weekly called "<span class="building">Oufbow</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3746">By now it's a biweekly. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And it was published in there and -- and my -- my uncle then also f -- supported me. </sentence><sentence id="3748">Finally we did get visas. </sentence><sentence id="3749">Th-The joint was extremely helpful there, they -- the <span class="building">joint</span> opened <span class="building">offices</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and with their help, the three of us finally got visas and we arrived here on the 22nd of June, 1947. </sentence><sentence id="3750">And -- and then my -- my first priority again here, was to study. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3751">End of <span class="dlf">Tape Eight</span>, <span class="dlf">Side A</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3752"> Beginning of Tape Eight, <span class="dlf">Side B</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3753">Q: This is tape three, side B, of an interview with Ernest Fontheim, on June fourth, 1997. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3754">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3755">After my arrival, my first priority, as I said, was to continue my studies. </sentence><sentence id="3756">My uncle provided the financial support in the beginning, for a-a few months. </sentence><sentence id="3757">And then -- I lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="3758">He had rented for me a furnished <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="region">upper West Side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3759">And then I took a job as a messenger boy on 48th -- <span class="dlf">West 48th Street</span>, between Fifth and <span class="dlf">Sixth Avenues</span>, for an outfit called Action Messenger Service. </sentence><sentence id="3760">We were a whole bunch of young guys who were lined up and the boss would always call one after the other to run certain errands. </sentence><sentence id="3761">For me that was great, that's how I got to know <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3762">I -- he sent me to one address to pick up a <span class="spatial object">package</span> to be delivered to a second address and I got to know <span class="populated place">New York</span> from downtown <span class="dlf">Wall Street</span> to <span class="populated place">midtown</span> and even further <span class="populated place">uptown</span> and I really fell in love with the <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3763">In the evening -- and by -- incidentally, I earned 50 cents an hour. </sentence><sentence id="3764">And in the evening, I took two or three courses, I forgot, in <span class="building">City College</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3765">And -- and I took some elementary physics, which I already had in <span class="country">Germany</span>, just in order to get up to speed also with the English language and with the technical expressions. </sentence><sentence id="3766"> 78 And I also had a course in calculus, which I -- also mostly was just review of what I had already learned in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3767">And I -- my goal, of course, was to become a full-time student and financially that wouldn't have been possible for me. </sentence><sentence id="3768">So through a friend of mine, I was referred to a committee with the interesting name, American Committee for Emigre Writers, Scholars and Artists. </sentence><sentence id="3769">And was sort of an interesting outfit. </sentence><sentence id="3770">Basically what they did is this, they did not have any money themselves, they served as a <span class="building">clearing house</span> for available grants, fellowships and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3771">So I registered with them and after, I forgot what it was, a few months -- I should say also, I had only A's from my first two semesters in <span class="building">City College</span>, so that obviously helped along. </sentence><sentence id="3772">And they told me that they had a Rotary international scholarship for <span class="building">Southwest Missouri State College</span>, in <span class="populated place">Springfield</span>, <span class="region">Missouri</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3773">I never heard of the place before and of course I didn't know at that time that there were such huge disparities between different <span class="building">academic institutions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3774">But anyway, I went there and I credit my two years in <span class="populated place">Springfield</span>, <span class="region">Missouri</span> and at that <span class="building">college</span>, mainly with my Americanization. </sentence><sentence id="3775">And one thing that bothered me in <span class="populated place">New York</span> is that the only social contact I had was not just with other German Jews, but mainly only with <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3776">Former <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> Jews I should say, I should say. </sentence><sentence id="3777">But -- and I realized that if I want to become acculturated in my new <span class="country">country</span>, I can't just have a s -- a social life only with people from the old <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3778">And -- but it was very difficult in <span class="building">City College</span>, leadto -- I tried several times unsuccessfully. </sentence><sentence id="3779">It's a <span class="building">commuter college</span>, people come, take classes and rush away. </sentence><sentence id="3780">Go back into the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> and go to <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span> or God knows where. </sentence><sentence id="3781">And so it's not really a <span class="building">campus</span> atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="3782">So when I got that scholarship, I took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> off to <span class="populated place">Springfield</span>, <span class="region">Missouri</span> and yeah -- and I should say that my friends, the Haas family, they --after some initial difficulty, settled in -- in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and Margaret's father got several jobs, improving as time went on, in the <span class="building">garment industry</span> as designer, pattern maker and so on, in ladies garments. </sentence><sentence id="3783">Of course we stayed in <span class="building">contact  79</span> as I went to <span class="populated place">Springfield</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3784">And there I was received by the dean, who felt that it would be a good idea if I would be put -- housed in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, which had been built on <span class="building">campus</span> for GI's. </sentence><sentence id="3785">That was the time of the GI Bill of Rights, after World War Two and there was such an influx of students that they needed to do something to -- to house them. </sentence><sentence id="3786">And so th-these <span class="building">barracks</span> were built. </sentence><sentence id="3787">They were relatively primitive, but as far as I was concerned, totally sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="3788">And of course, there I learned all the slang that I hadn't learned in all my years of English in the <span class="building">German high school</span>, including all the four letter words, which I hadn't known before. </sentence><sentence id="3789">And -- and in general got sort of acculturated to life in a small, <span class="populated place">Midwestern town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3790">As the -- coincidence would have it, also the -- the dean, right away set me in touch with the local rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3791">And it turned out that rabbi also was a form-former German Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3792">He was -- he wa -- had been rabbi in the <span class="populated place">Bavarian city</span> of <span class="populated place">Oxbourg</span> before the war and now he was rabbi in <span class="populated place">Springfield</span>, <span class="region">Missouri</span> and he and his family took me somewhat under their wings. </sentence><sentence id="3793">I -- I was often invited to Shabbat evening dinners at their <span class="building">house</span> and obviously each time for the Seder. </sentence><sentence id="3794">And so I lived with them -- but -- not lived with, I mean I socialized with them and on the other hand, I also had American contacts and I even made dates with American girls. </sentence><sentence id="3795">And so -- and -- and my <span class="building">school</span> performance turned out to be very well. </sentence><sentence id="3796">I did very well in all classes, so when I graduated then in -- in 1950, with a Bachelor's Degree, I got an offer, actually several offers, but the one that I accepted for <span class="building">graduate school</span> was from <span class="building">Lehigh University</span> in <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3797">Admission to <span class="building">graduate school</span>, plus a guaranteed sort of teaching assistantship in the <span class="building">physics department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3798">And so, in the summer of 1950 isa, I got my Bachelor's Degree. </sentence><sentence id="3799">That was in July, but I remained a bachelor then for less than a month. </sentence><sentence id="3800">But o-on the sixth of August, Margaret and I finally got married. </sentence><sentence id="3801">And that was in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and -- and then we moved together to -- to <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span>, where I started my graduate studies. </sentence><sentence id="3802">That graduate studies turned out, unfortunately extended for more years  80 than I had originally anticipated, and is customary, for a number of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="3803">I had some bad luck with my first thesis subject and so on, but I don't want to go into that here now, but I -- o-of general interest is maybe that in the s -- in the -- in my first summer there, it was the summer of "51, [had a summer job at <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span> <span class="building">Steel Company</span>, which is in the same <span class="populated place">city</span> as <span class="building">Lehigh University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3804">And the company -- in fact the <span class="building">steel plant</span>, I think the company still exists, but the <span class="building">steel plant</span> doesn't exist anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3805">But I saw a <span class="building">steel plant</span> from the inside and I found all of that very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3806">How steel is being made and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3807">And then two years later, in "53, I hada summer job at <span class="dlf">White Sands proving ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3808">That was a <span class="dlf">rocket proving ground</span> before anyone even knew that the <span class="country">United States</span> was deeply involved in rocketry. </sentence><sentence id="3809">At that time, they just shot -- shot captured <span class="spatial object">German V2 rockets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3810">And some clever physicist had gotten the idea to -- while these <span class="spatial object">rockets</span> are being shot with harmless <span class="spatial object">warheads</span>, just to test their flight characteristics, why not put some instruments on the -- in -- in the <span class="spatial object">warhead</span>, to measure properties in the <span class="region">upper atmosphere</span>, <span class="env feature">ionosphere</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3811">And actually I was hired partly to write a sort of research paper on certain aspects on how to detect cosmic rays. </sentence><sentence id="3812">And so that filled my summer and I didn't realize at that time, that in fact space physics would at one time become my life's profession. </sentence><sentence id="3813">In 1954, the following summer, I spent -- I had a special fellowship for -- to <span class="populated place">Brookhaven</span>, the <span class="building">national laboratory</span>, which at that time was the foremost <span class="building">laboratory</span> for -- in the world, not only this <span class="country">country</span>, for high energy physics. </sentence><sentence id="3814">And th-there was a <span class="spatial object">machine</span> that could accelerate particles to unheard of -- at that time -- energies, and cause all kinds of interesting effects and collisions. </sentence><sentence id="3815">And I worked with some famous physicists there, I -- I met, among others there, Enrico Fermi, who -- the famous Italian physicist and Nobel prize winner and several others. </sentence><sentence id="3816">And -- and then I- I wrote a f -- a thesis, back at <span class="building">Lehigh University</span> in a fairly esoteric, purely mathematical subject in theoretical physics, involving fundamental particles and -- and field theory. </sentence><sentence id="3817">I graduated in  81 1960 and by that time already, we had two children. </sentence><sentence id="3818">I-I-I should have mentioned that after we married, in August 1950 and moved to <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span>, Margot worked for a number of years in an <span class="building">office</span> and in 1955, she was pregnant with our son, Claude, who was born in August, "55 and -- and then in -- in O-October "59, our daughter Eva was born. </sentence><sentence id="3819">And in "60, she was less than a year old, we moved from <span class="populated place">Bethlehem</span> to <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span>, <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3820">And in <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span>, I have worked -- actually I was for two years in the <span class="building">radiation laboratory</span> and the <span class="building">radiation laboratory</span> sort of started to fold and go downhill. </sentence><sentence id="3821">And then I obtained an offer from the <span class="building">space physics research laboratory</span> in 1962, where I -- I stayed until my retirement in 1992. </sentence><sentence id="3822">I -- during that time I had a also varied, interesting career. </sentence><sentence id="3823">I attended many international meetings, including one in 1971, in <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>, which interested me very much. </sentence><sentence id="3824">I-I should add, incidentally, that I taught myself the Cyrillic alphabet during my two years -- postwar years in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, from "45 to "47. </sentence><sentence id="3825">Because the Russians immediately after their arrival, one of the first things -- they put under the <span class="dlf">German street</span> names, the -- the name in R-Russian -- in Cyrillic letters, so that their soldiers could orient themselves in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3826">And simply by comparison and also by -- by knowing the Greek alphabet, which I knew from the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, I -- I could figure out the entire alphabet, so going to <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> in -- in'71, at least I wasn't lost. </sentence><sentence id="3827">I could read <span class="dlf">street</span> names and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3828">In "72 I attended an international conference in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, which -- an-and just shortly before that time, I had read several diaries and reports about <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, including the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3829">And the visit to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was a emotionally very shattering experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="3830">I -- I spent every free minute that I was not at the meeting, walking around the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and -- which I all knew, from the books and -- that I'd read. </sentence><sentence id="3831">And -- and observed and of course -- this is well known, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was totally destroyed by the Germans after they captured it and -- and then the Poles completely leveled everything that was left and then built sort of a <span class="interior space">worker's apartment</span> in a style which I call  <span class="building">82 Socialist Modern</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3832">Which means <span class="dlf">modern lines</span>, but shoddy construction. </sentence><sentence id="3833">And -- and I-I just walked through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and in my mental eye, saw in front of me, the Jews who lived there, only a few years before. </sentence><sentence id="3834">It was there 30 years later that I was there, which is nothing, in history. </sentence><sentence id="3835">In -- in "70, let me see, in "78 I spent a year, I'm sorry, I spent a summer in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3836">I -- a --a former student of mine actually, w-who got his PhD u-under my supervision in the late "60's. </sentence><sentence id="3837">Was a French fellow, with whom I had an also personal friendship and we stayed in touch and he was probably one of my most successful students. </sentence><sentence id="3838">He -- by now he is director of a big <span class="building">laboratory</span> in <span class="populated place">Toulouse</span>, but at that time he was already head of a group and he invited me to spend the summer of "78 there and I went there with Margot and our daughter Eva, who at that time -- "78, what was she doing then? </sentence><sentence id="3839">She must have been a college freshman. </sentence><sentence id="3840">And -- and that was <span class="populated place">marv</span> -- we lived really like -- like French people. </sentence><sentence id="3841">We rented a furnished <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and Margaret and Eva, during the day, went of course to visit <span class="building">museums</span> and sights around the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and -- and on weekends we did things together. </sentence><sentence id="3842">It was a -- one of m -- the best summers we had. </sentence><sentence id="3843">And in "76, by the way, I had a summer position at the <span class="building">space physics laboratory</span> of the <span class="building">University of California and Berkeley</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3844">That was where we -- we made a cross country trip by <span class="spatial object">car</span>, which is the only way to see this <span class="country">country</span>, is really by driving through it. </sentence><sentence id="3845">It's fascinating how the <span class="env feature">landscape</span> changes, the architecture changes and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3846">And on the fourth of July, actually -- we -- we first visited friends in <span class="populated place">San Diego</span> and <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span> and on the fourth of July we drove up from <span class="populated place">L.A.</span> to -- to <span class="populated place">San Francisco</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3847">And of course the fourth of July is Independence Day, obviously and in "76 it was the 200th anniversary of the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3848">But in addition to that, it was also the day where Israeli commandos liberated the prisoners in <span class="populated place">Entebbe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3849">And we were driving along and listening to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, you know, just for diversion, when suddenly a newsflash came on that Israeli commandos had liberated the passengers of a -- I think it was an <span class="spatial object">Air France plane</span> with <span class="spatial object">Israeli  83</span> and also other citizens on it. </sentence><sentence id="3850">And so that was a perfect way for us to celebrate Independence Day. </sentence><sentence id="3851">And -- and then in the evening, after we arrived in <span class="populated place">Berkeley</span>, we were told that already ahead of time, that there's always a big firework over <span class="env feature">San Francisco Bay</span> and the best way to view it is from the -- from the <span class="region">eastern side</span> of the <span class="env feature">bay</span>, from <span class="populated place">Berkeley</span>, in other words, th-the <span class="building">space physics lab</span> is on -- on -- on a -- on a <span class="env feature">mountain</span> where also the <span class="building">radiation lab</span> is located. </sentence><sentence id="3852">And it was a tremendous experience to see the fireworks over <span class="env feature">San Francisco Bay</span> on the fourth of July, 1976.Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3953">Q: Let me ask you a few questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3955">A: All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3957">Q: Okay? </sentence><sentence id="3958">What -- what -- when you look back, I mean you've now had a lot of time and you -- you're rela -- you're fairly reflective. </sentence><sentence id="3959">What sort of long term impact did these early experiences have on you, on the -- on the way you've lived your life, on your general outlook or the way you've raised your kids? </sentence><sentence id="3960">Could you talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3965">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3966">I mean, it had a tremendous impact and in fact the impact increased as the years went by. </sentence><sentence id="3967">I -- I mean the fact that my parents, my sister and my first girlfriend, plus innumerable other people I knew or I didn't know, just vanished and were brutally murdered because of some unbelievable ideology which somebody cooked up, is so unna -- it -- it -- it's even for me today not understandable, how that could have happened. </sentence><sentence id="3968">And I have been sort of totally more and more absorbed by it as the year went by. </sentence><sentence id="3969">I -- I read -- I have, I mean innumerable books, some of them I haven't even read yet, on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3970">I mean starting with the standard works by -- by <span class="populated place">Hillburg</span> and what's her name? </sentence><sentence id="3971"><span class="dlf">Yahyah Hill</span>, the <span class="building">Israeli Estroyen</span> and also <span class="building">Lucy Davidovitch</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3972">But in addition to that, all kinds of -- of special works by authors on special subjects like the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3973">I own a number of diaries, including Rhea Blumes, notes and -- and on -- on  84 -- also on -- on -- on German Jews and I -- of course fascinated particularly by the fate of -- of German Jews, because that's what I am and I was totally raised in <span class="country">Germany</span> and -- and how that could have happened, of all <span class="country">countries</span>, in that <span class="country">country</span>, is something that I -- I have wrestled with all the -- for years and years and have not really come to a conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="3974">What it really was that gave rise to this unbelievable crime and you know that was com -- also it was committed by people who were mostly highly educated and although there were some uneducated at the lower levels, but at the higher levels they were of -- Goebbels was a PhD and -- and -- and many other people and -- who -- who are not that well known, but were in high positions, were highly educated. </sentence><sentence id="3975">And to plan a mass murder on that scale and carry it out is -- is totally mind boggling and so -- and -- and then another thing is that the fate of my immediate family is -- I'm -- I'm trying to picture my father, even on the -- on the de -- on the deportation <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3976">I mean how -- I-I- I mean going into such de-detail as y-you know that each -- each <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span> where people were transported and they were basically freight or <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, had just -- somewhere -- big <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> where people could relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3977">I couldn't -- I can't even believe how -- how anyone would even be able to relieve themself in public, with everybody standing around, in a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="3978">The -- the idea, to humiliate Jews to such an unbelievable extent and how my father even -- an-and then, on the day that they left, the temperatures were -- I mean <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in winter was anyway cold, I think now it's not as cold any more, but at that time it was much colder, but that was an unusually cold day, even for that time. </sentence><sentence id="3979">I-I checked the meteorological records again, to -- and have that at <span class="building">home</span>, actually. </sentence><sentence id="3980">And to -- to -- to reconfirm, that was just my memory, but it -- were extremely cold days j -- and of course the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> were unheated and -- and how my family was treated after they arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, or that they went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, that is a matter of record. </sentence><sentence id="3981">And my friend Ruth, I think, was deported to <span class="populated place">Riga</span> and from -- but I -- from what little I  85 know, it may have happened that they were immediately transported by <span class="spatial object">truck</span> into some <span class="env feature">forest</span> and shot. </sentence><sentence id="3982">And s-so I-I have been -- as the years went by I have more and more occupied myself with that. </sentence><sentence id="3983">For example, I was instrumental in <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span>, to start a annual sort of observance of Yom HaShoah, which has been now going on for over 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="3984">And I was also involved -- <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span> has a <span class="spatial object">statue</span> now, commemorating the Holocaust, where I was involved in -- both in raising the money and in getting the idea through, it's a -- the -- the artist who made the <span class="spatial object">statue</span> is Leonard Baskin, who, by the way, also made one of the statues of the new <span class="building">FDR memorial</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And so I'm -- IJ-I must say that I am -- m-my -- yeah then -- did you ask me how I raised m -- what affect of raising my children and -- and in two ways. </sentence><sentence id="3986">First of all, I have always talked to them about that period and -- and in -- in 1981 in fact, that was when our son graduated from -- from <span class="building">law school</span> in <span class="region">Michigan</span> and our daughter was actually still a year away from -- from graduation, but we proposed sort of for them, a joint graduation gift, that's a trip to <span class="country">Europe</span>, sort of as students like to do it, sort of to bum around. </sentence><sentence id="3987">They could select where they wanted to go, sort of and you know, hos -- <span class="building">youth hostels</span> and so on, with one proviso. </sentence><sentence id="3988">In "81, I was at an international meeting, I think in June or so, in <span class="populated place">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="country">Scotland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3989">And I-I suggested that we meet in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on -- on a certain week, so that Margot and I could show them where we grew up, respectively and also where we went to <span class="building">school</span> and other places of relevance to -- in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="3990">And so that's what we did, we actually -- after -- from <span class="populated place">Edinburgh</span>, you know, we flew to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3991">The kids had already left earlier. </sentence><sentence id="3992">They had decided first to make a brief swing through <span class="region">parts of Scandinavia</span>, they were in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, then <span class="region">southern Sweden</span>, okay and then they went into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3993">We met there and spent a week there and we -- we sh -- went also to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> where some of our forebears, gros grandparents and so on, are buried. </sentence><sentence id="3994">And some famous German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3995">In <span class="country">Germany</span> the <span class="spatial object">gravestones</span> are also more, sort of descriptive, I mean you can really see who  86 somebody was. </sentence><sentence id="3996">I mean it explains -- somebody may have been professor of this or that at this <span class="building">university</span> or -- or may have been an architect or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3997">Anyway -- and -- and then -- the rest of the time they continued then, on their own. </sentence><sentence id="3998">So, coming back to your question, I mean I -- I saw to it, but I also w-we wanted to make them also very conscious of their Jewish heritage and Margot and I often feel, that in that respect maybe we didn't do too great a job. </sentence><sentence id="3999">We had -- we sort of totally relied -- we are members of a conservative <span class="building">synagogue</span> and of course, you know, money constraints being what they are, they can't really hire first rate teachers, so they usually use college students who come from more or less <span class="building">religious homes</span>, to teach sort of the standard things in elementary Hebrew and Biblical history and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4000">But they still, they are -- our daughter now even, is taking now here a course in basics of Judaism, I think, at the <span class="building">DCJCC</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4037">Q: Wh-what what I'm asking is maybe a little bit more subtle. </sentence><sentence id="4038">It's, do you think that you acted differently than you might have? </sentence><sentence id="4039">Do you think that you have certain values or you instilled certain values -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4043">A: Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4045">Q: As a result of your experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4047">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4048">Okay, that -- thank you for raising that question. </sentence><sentence id="4049">I was -- I-I was never only concerned exclusively with the Jewish faith, although this is obviously the one that's closest to me, but I was always appalled, I mean for example, also, with the treatment of blacks here in this <span class="country">country</span>, or Afro-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="4050">And I-I have been always quite active in -- in -- in <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="4051">I mean today's -- seems long ago, but there was at one time strict housing segregation and there was a large group in which I was involved, for passage of <span class="populated place">city</span> ordinances, to make such segregation illegal, particularly by real estate agents, loan practices by <span class="building">banks</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4052">And I took the children sometimes along to demonstrations, I mean just to -- and they are both -- both of our  87 children -- E-Eva, our daughter, is involved now in the Hunger Coalition here, which incidentally my wife is also very much involved, in <span class="populated place">Ann Arbor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4053">And our son is involved with the Anti-defamation League and such organizations. </sentence><sentence id="4054">So we always instilled in them that it is important for everybody to work for equality, not just for yourself or your own group, but for all groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4063">Q: Were there certain, or are there certain fears that have stuck with you as a result of your experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4065">A: Very, very seldom, I have some dreams or some thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="4066">I mean I -- I just recently, when I woke up earlier in the morning than I-I should have probably, I thought of that incident with that civilian police guy who stopped me on the <span class="spatial object">subway</span> and where I ask myself the question, what if my assessment was wrong and my lingering around there would have caused him -- he could have, any time while I was at that <span class="building">newspaper kiosk</span>, pretending to look at newspapers, he could have tapped on my shoulder and said, "Why don't you come along, I want to ask you some more questions." </sentence><sentence id="4067">And then, that would have been the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="4068">And -- and sort of I elaborated on that in my fantasies. </sentence><sentence id="4069">I w -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4075">Q: I mean there are people who probably wouldn't have gotten -- wouldn't ride a <span class="spatial object">subway</span> today, do you know what I mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4077">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4079">Q: I'm trying to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4081">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4082">Oh, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4085">Q: If there are certain -- certain images, certain sounds that really trigger memories for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4087">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4089">Q: Ina very powerful way? </sentence><sentence id="4090"> 88 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4091">A: Well actually, it's not a memory, it's sirens -- for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="4092">First of all, they signaled air raids, but they also, you know my father was basically abducted, that's what the correct word for that would have been. </sentence><sentence id="4093">And normally, you would call the police and -- and they would come with their sirens blaring and whenever I hear sirens, particularly in a <span class="spatial object">police car</span>, sometimes I've actually -- tears are welling, thinking of it. </sentence><sentence id="4094">They should have come and rescued my parents, they were being abducted in broad daylight. </sentence><sentence id="4095">And -- and I visited -- I visited by now, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> four times and that is also a -- something I still have not come to -- to grips with. </sentence><sentence id="4096">But in general, I -- in my day to day life, fortunately, I have not had any, I mean to my knowledge at least, any sort of real strong emotional effects of, I mean like you say, not wanting to ride <span class="spatial object">subways</span> or things. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4097">Q: Is there anything else you want to add, because I think we've covered a lot and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4099">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4100">I mean actually, o-one thing that I wanted to say and forgot, that in one of the earlier tapes, I think I made some mistakes in two dates. </sentence><sentence id="4101">One is that highacoo -- <span class="building">high school</span> friend of mine, at one point I said -- left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to emigrate to <span class="country">England</span> on January 18, 1938. </sentence><sentence id="4102">Now, in context that of course could not have been in -- in -- as I explained at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4103">His parents were Austrians and in January "38, <span class="country">Austria</span> still was an independent country. </sentence><sentence id="4104">Ex-Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="4105"><span class="country">Austria</span> was occupied in March "38 and so then they lost their protection. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And he left Ger -- actually <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on January 18, "39. </sentence><sentence id="4107">In other words, about three quarters of a year after <span class="country">Austria</span> lost its independent. </sentence><sentence id="4108">The second date correction, the arrest of my girlfriend Ruth. </sentence><sentence id="4109">I said at one time, it's November 9, "41. </sentence><sentence id="4110">That -- also th -- in November -- I-I'm sorry, September 9, "41, I said. </sentence><sentence id="4111">The first deportation left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> only at the end of September "41 and she was deported on September 9, "42, not "41. </sentence><sentence id="4112">I mean that's just -- it doesn't change anything, but to correct the misstatement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4127">Q: Any overall thought or statement you'd like to make? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4129">A: Well --  89 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4130">Q: Doesn't have to be specific, but just any -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4131">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4132">I would think really two or three things. </sentence><sentence id="4133">One of them is that there is a lot of basic value in Judaism and that it's sort of incumbent on us to really familiarize ourselves with it. </sentence><sentence id="4134">| mean there -- for many Jews in this <span class="country">country</span>, there has been sort of -- the Holocaust has been treated almost like a substitute religion, particularly in recent years and I think that is almost sick. </sentence><sentence id="4135">I think the Holocaust must be remembered, of course, but not as a -- in the sense of a religion, but in the sense that we, first of all should remember always, just like we remember other events in our history, going back to <span class="populated place">Masada</span>, to the destruction of the two <span class="building">temples</span> and so on and also to learn from it. </sentence><sentence id="4136">Learn what to do and also what not to do. </sentence><sentence id="4137">The other thing is, that aside from Judaism, I -- I also don't believe that one should be focused 100 percent on one's Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="4138">Like I know there are such Jews, but that since we are living in a -- in a broader world, that it is also the duty of everyone to involve him or herself in the daily politics. </sentence><sentence id="4139">To fight for what is right and to fight for -- ag-against injustice, also against other groups. </sentence><sentence id="4140">I think that is -- that is one thing th-th-that is important, I mean the -- there is a famous, by now it's a cliche, quote -- I think it is from the German, "<span class="building">Pustor Nimala</span>." </sentence><sentence id="4141">At -- at first they came after the Communists -- I mean the Nazis, I didn't particularly care because I wasn't a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="4142">Then they went after the Jews and didn't b-bother me either, I'm not a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4143">Then they went after homosexuals and didn't bother me, I'm not a homosexual. </sentence><sentence id="4144">Then they went after Catholics, that didn't bother me and when they came after me, there was nobody left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
