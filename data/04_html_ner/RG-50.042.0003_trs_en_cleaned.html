<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">beep </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: Why don't we start talking about the 1930s, and why don't you tell me how old you were and what you remember of daily life as it was impacted by the Nazi party, how it came into greater and greater power--pogroms, laws... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Now, well actually I think I should start in the, let me see, I was born in 1910, so that would have been around 1930 when the Nazi party really came into being. </sentence><sentence id="4">And I remember that they were then a party #26, we had many, many political parties in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time, and they were party #26. </sentence><sentence id="5">They had advantage over other political parties such as the communists and democrats because they had a lot of money backing behind them and when they marched into a certain <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, they had beautiful shiny boots and beautiful uniforms and they marched in military uh formation, whereas, democrats and the communists at that time, they were organized, but they were like a bunch of people running down the <span class="dlf">street</span>, as compared to well-organized march of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="6">We lived at that time in an <span class="region">area</span> called ----------------- in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, which was a <span class="populated place">working class neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">I would say, very largely communist, not necessarily party members, but certainly sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="8">There was one particular day I remember quite vividly, when the Nazis decided they wanted to march down the main <span class="dlf">street</span> in our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, by the thousands incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="9">And, we...didn't exactly like the idea, this was our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, our turf. </sentence><sentence id="10">There was a lot of shooting. </sentence><sentence id="11"><span class="spatial object">Machine guns</span> had been mounted on <span class="dlf">roofs</span>, would shoot into the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">Group, and so forth, and that became a very bloody affair. </sentence><sentence id="13">This was only one time. </sentence><sentence id="14">I guess it, I'm not quite sure about the date, but it was in 1930, a very early 1930. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was involved in many of the anti-Nazi street fights, and ----------, I was never a member of a party really, but certainly a sympathizer. </sentence><sentence id="16">But then I was only 20 years old or 21 years old, so I had a lot of things that I wouldn't do today. </sentence><sentence id="17">And, it is generally assumed that the Holocaust, and it rightly so, actually started until 1942, when the <span class="populated place">death camps</span> came into being, but that's not really quite true, not in my opinion because the first boycott of the <span class="building">Jewish stores</span> happened in April 30, 1932! </sentence><sentence id="18">Where they took all, this is a long time before the holocaust started, as per se holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="19">They uh, boycotted the <span class="dlf">doors</span> of the <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>, put the name "juden" on the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and so forth, and they marched in front of those <span class="building">stores</span> for prevent customers from going in, but there were many people, I remember very vividly, one This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="20">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="21"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection particular <span class="building">store</span> in the <span class="region">area</span> that we lived in was a <span class="building">cigar store</span>, it sold cigars and cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="22">I know, my neighbors went in there, they never smoked a cigarette in their life, they just went in there to spite the Nazi movement at that time, they were not very much in favor of it. </sentence><sentence id="23">But we have to put this in a proper context, things were very bad in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">Unemployment was perhaps, I'm not sure of this now, but I would say perhaps 20% people weren't working, there, there was no jobs to be had, and as time went on, they became more and more sympathetic to the Nazi movement, first, I would imagine, for economic reasons and secondly, it became very popular to be antisemitic because it was easiest thing in the world, if you want to hate somebody, the Jews are always around! </sentence><sentence id="25">They can be hated. </sentence><sentence id="26">So, in my opinion, the actual holocaust, with the exception of the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, started in 1932, and, as I said before, April the 30th. </sentence><sentence id="27">A group of young men, friends of mine, we used to hang around together, we were quite active in dancing and all this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="28">We decided we're going to join the army. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was not an army, it was called uh...<span class="building">Arbeitz</span>, <span class="building">Arbeitz</span>, Arbeiten, I don't recall exactly the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="30">It was a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, in which we had regular military training except for weapons. </sentence><sentence id="31">That was against the Versailles Treaty at that time, which had been still obeyed then. </sentence><sentence id="32">We had no weapons, but we marched in military formation and, and we used uh, uh spades, shovels, as rifles, which marching and all this kind of thing, we had a regular military training. </sentence><sentence id="33">At that time that I went in there, it was, nobody asked me if I was Jewish, and I didn't mention it, so we all got accepted into this uh <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Somehow or other, I don't recall how, they found out that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="35">I was sta-uh stationed in <span class="populated place">Marineburg</span>, <span class="region">East Prussia</span>, which was right near the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Elding</span>, also in <span class="region">East Prussia</span>, and <span class="populated place">Elbing</span> then was German, but it had been independent uh earlier. </sentence><sentence id="36">It's been kicked back and forth between <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span> for many years. </sentence><sentence id="37">We marched from <span class="populated place">Marineburg</span> to <span class="populated place">Elding</span>, which was, I'd say, about 30 kilometers, and we stood guard for Hitler, and I claimed to have very distinct, uh, I don't know what I should call it. </sentence><sentence id="38">I probably was the only Jew in the world that ever stood guard for Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="39">I saw him as close as I see you right in front of me now. </sentence><sentence id="40">He was making a speech at the <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="populated place">Elding</span>, and as he walked by us, reviewing the troops, he was a little man, everyone knows the mustache and his hairdo, and he looked perfectly calm and we stood out there waiting for him to finish, which took about 3 hours. </sentence><sentence id="41">When he came out, and he marched by us again toward his <span class="spatial object">car</span>, the man looked, and I remember this very vividly. </sentence><sentence id="42">He looked as, like a maniac, he talked himself into a total frenzy. </sentence><sentence id="43">I don't believe that he even knew what he was speaking about anymore, because he was, he looked a, a person that has not control over his emotions anymore. </sentence><sentence id="44">It was found out somehow or other, as I said before, that I was Jewish, and I was discharged from this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">I must have been in there, I don't remember exactly, I'd say close to a year. </sentence><sentence id="46">This was in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="47">Nothing much happened between 1932 and 1935 except the regular political uh marches through <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span> that they weren't wanted and so forth, and in the meantime, the Nazi party grew, and grew in popularity. </sentence><sentence id="48">A lot of the German fellows, young fellows, they weren't really antisemitic or anti anything, but they had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="49">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="50"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection nothing to do, they had no jobs, and here, they come around they give them a beautiful pair of boots, and they give them a nice shirt and a pair of britches, and have a gun in your hip, you know, you can go out and shoot somebody, it's okay, you'll get away with it. </sentence><sentence id="51">Now, that became very popular, but in 1935, actually it was September 15, a new law came into being, and that a German family could not have a gentile maid, there were many Jewish families were quite wealthy too, and they had a maid, a live-in maid. </sentence><sentence id="52">They could not have a live-in maid under the age of 55, for apparently, obvious reasons. </sentence><sentence id="53">They also at the same time a law took effect that did not allow a Jewish person, male or female, to go with a Gentile person, male or female. </sentence><sentence id="54">At that time, I was going with a nice young lady that I had gone with for some time, and we were out camping, I remember very well, I had a <span class="spatial object">kayak</span>, and we went out camping near <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, and there was a fellow and, next to us, near us, in another little <span class="populated place">camp</span> with a <span class="building">tent</span>, we slept in <span class="building">tents</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">He wanted to make a date with this young lady that I was going with, and she didn't want any part of it. </sentence><sentence id="56">He reported me to, to the Gestapo, and I was arrested for going with a gentile girl. </sentence><sentence id="57">I got six months in <span class="building">prison</span>, solitary confinement in 1935. </sentence><sentence id="58">When I was released, I became known as a habitual criminal in the eyes of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="59">I was a habitual criminal. </sentence><sentence id="60">I never did anything criminal in my life, but as far as they're concerned, being, doing something against the law was enough to make me a habitual criminal. </sentence><sentence id="61">As a result of that image that was put on us, I was arrested again 3 years later, on June 14, 1938 at 4 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had gone to a birthday party of my sister in law. </sentence><sentence id="63">I was already married. </sentence><sentence id="64">I had a baby, my wife was pregnant again. </sentence><sentence id="65">Four o'clock in the morning there's a banging on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">We woke up, we said, "What are they? </sentence><sentence id="67">Crazy? </sentence><sentence id="68">They want to continue the party 4 o'clock in the morning?" </sentence><sentence id="69">And I yelled, "Go on <span class="building">home</span>! </sentence><sentence id="70">That's enough!" </sentence><sentence id="71">And the banging persisted and I opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and there came 2 plain clothes men with guns, "You're under arrest." " </sentence><sentence id="72">Under arrest? </sentence><sentence id="73">What for? </sentence><sentence id="74">I didn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="75">No questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="76">I said, "Would you mind getting out so my wife can get up?" </sentence><sentence id="77">He says, "Oh, that won't bother us." </sentence><sentence id="78">I said, "It may bother her." </sentence><sentence id="79">So, they stepped outside the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I got up, I got dressed, they took me to a <span class="building">police station</span> near the <span class="region">area</span> where we lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="176">We had gone to a birthday party on June the 14th, so some friends of ours who had come <span class="building">home</span>, must have been about midnight, somewhere around midnight. </sentence><sentence id="177">Four o clock in the morning, we had a banging on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I thought those were our friends coming back to continue the celebration. </sentence><sentence id="178">I said, "Come on, go on <span class="building">home</span>, it's enough already. </sentence><sentence id="179">You know, 4 0 clock, got to work tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="180">The knocking persisted, I opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and two plain clothes men with guns came in to the <span class="interior space">room</span>, "You're under arrest."

" </sentence><sentence id="190">I don't know, I didn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="191">We didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="192">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="193">We had absolutely no idea what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="194">All we knew, we were under arrest. </sentence><sentence id="195">Around 7 0 clock or 6 0 clock in the morning, they loaded us all on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and they took it to a remote <span class="building">train station</span> in a place called <span class="populated place">Foulsborough</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's a name, it's in a, a suburb of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">The <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> were supported by a police--well, those are <span class="spatial object">storm trooper cars</span>, not really <span class="spatial object">police cars</span>, the private police had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="198">They had a <span class="spatial object">car</span> in front of the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and <span class="spatial object">car</span> in back of the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and one on each side with bloodhounds. </sentence><sentence id="199">To be facetious, they wanted to be sure nobody gets lost, you know. </sentence><sentence id="200">They took us to the <span class="building">train station</span>, and we were loaded, we were loaded into regular <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, not <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, as what happened later. </sentence><sentence id="201">We were not in <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, we went in a regular <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and then, several hours of <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride, we didn't where we, we had no idea what was happening, and you can imagine some older people, I was just a young fellow, but there were some older people--started crying, we didn't know, what did we do? </sentence><sentence id="202">When we got to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they loaded us back on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> again, no that is not correct. </sentence><sentence id="203">We went to a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span>, which is a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">How far outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="205">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped, they shoved us all out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we began to march towards the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">We still didn't know what was going to be, we had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="207">Along the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride, some, we had to run, there was no walking. </sentence><sentence id="208">One particular incident I recall (pause) like it was yesterday, an old gentleman with the name of Solomon, I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="209">He must have been well in his 70s, he simply couldn't run. </sentence><sentence id="210">He couldn't run, he had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="211">He couldn't run and he collapsed, and he laid in the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and one of the storm troopers, a tall young fellow, very slender, very tall, stepped on this throat (blows his nose), this is true. </sentence><sentence id="212">Unbelievable but true, till the man was dead. </sentence><sentence id="213">We had to pick up his body, and throw him to the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and we continued on into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, where we were assembled in a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, and a strange incident happened at that time. </sentence><sentence id="214">We faced a <span class="building">barrack</span>, a <span class="dlf">door</span> on the right, a <span class="dlf">door</span> on the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="215"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="216">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="217"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection left. </sentence><sentence id="218">People went in the left <span class="dlf">door</span>, came out the right <span class="dlf">door</span>, entirely different people. </sentence><sentence id="219">Their hair was shaven off, they had a prisoner's uniform on, the very wide striped uniform. </sentence><sentence id="220">My number was 6199. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="221">A strange thing happened as I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="222">My parents were separated. </sentence><sentence id="223">I hadn't seen my father, and he was my step father I must say, in perhaps 8 years, maybe 9 years, right after I was bar mitvahed, my parents separated for a specific reason, and I hadn't seen him in all these years, and I saw him, met him in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">It was uh, hard to describe the emotion. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father was a very, very big man, he weighed 350 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="226">And I introduced myself, he didn't recognize me of course. </sentence><sentence id="227">And we became a family again. </sentence><sentence id="228">While we were in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I tried to take care of him as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="229">There wasn't too much that I can, could do at the time, but, I just have to mention it because this all relates to a very traumatic experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="230">We worked ten hours a day if I remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="231">We slept on straw, on <span class="spatial object">strawbacks</span>, it was a uh jude sack filled with straw. </sentence><sentence id="232">I guess that's common uh you know, under certain circumstances, many people sleep that way, and we worked 10 hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="233">On a <span class="dlf">field</span> that was approximately a square kilometer, somewhere around that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">One <span class="region">area</span> of this <span class="dlf">field</span> was quite high, the other <span class="region">area</span> was quite low. </sentence><sentence id="235">The <span class="region">area</span> had to be leveled, and what was done was they had <span class="dlf">tracks</span> running from one end to the other. </sentence><sentence id="236">On those <span class="dlf">tracks</span> were <span class="spatial object">mining cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">Now in this <span class="country">country</span>, a <span class="spatial object">mining car</span> is square. </sentence><sentence id="238">Over there a <span class="spatial object">mining car</span> is a triangular shape. </sentence><sentence id="239"><span class="spatial object">Steel mining cars</span>, and each <span class="spatial object">train</span> had about ten of these <span class="spatial object">mining cars</span> on it. </sentence><sentence id="240">On each one of those <span class="spatial object">mining cars</span> storm trooper was standing with a re--and we had to run from one end of this <span class="dlf">field</span> to the other, shovel the <span class="spatial object">mining cart</span> full of dirt, and return to empty it out on the lower end. </sentence><sentence id="241">If anyone would have told me at that time that I can run 40 kilometers a day, I'd say you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="242">But I did. </sentence><sentence id="243">Day after day after day. </sentence><sentence id="244">The food was barely edible, I remember one particular incident, it so happens I hate broccoli, and they had broccoli soup for 3 days in a row, and for 3 days in a row I didn't eat anything, just dry bread. </sentence><sentence id="245">The other prisoners gave me some of their bread. </sentence><sentence id="246">They ate the soup, I got the bread. </sentence><sentence id="247">I just couldn't eat it because if I had I would have gotten sick. </sentence><sentence id="248">Psychological? </sentence><sentence id="249">Certainly, but I'm entitled. </sentence><sentence id="250">At one time, they assembled us in a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">They had <span class="building">machine gun towers</span> all the way around, and they were shooting machine gun bullets over our head, maybe a foot above our head, and they said, they made a, the commander made a speech, they said that if <span class="country">Germany</span>, this was the time of <span class="country">Germany</span> taking over the-------------- in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">They said if <span class="country">Germany</span> gets involved in the war because of -------------, these machine guns will be lowered and we're going to kill you all. </sentence><sentence id="253">We, we were hoping that this wasn't going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="254">Perhaps, many people will recall a Christian pastor with the name of Niemoller. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="255">He was arrested from the <span class="interior space">pulpit</span> in a little <span class="building">church</span> somewhere in <span class="region">Midwestern Germany</span> because he simply didn't believe in the Nazi doctrine, and he was preaching openly against it, and he was arrested and put in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it became like an international incident at the time. </sentence><sentence id="256">I met him in -------- <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">What they did to this man, one human being doing this to another, is beyond description. </sentence><sentence id="258">This man in the perhaps 6 months that he was in our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, aged 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="259">Perhaps I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="260">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="261"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection shouldn't say this, but they literally made him eat his own waste, but he lived through it because he had very strong faith. </sentence><sentence id="262">I just mention this to convey what one human being can do to another. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="263">When you read this in a book it's one thing, when you see it and it actually happens it's quite another, I assure you. </sentence><sentence id="264">While I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> I had pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="265">The commander used to come in and inspect the <span class="interior space">sleeping quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">There was no <span class="interior space">living quarters</span>, we only had <span class="spatial object">beds</span> in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, and other than that, we stayed outside, there was no anywhere where we could relax or assemble, no way. </sentence><sentence id="267">And he used to hold his nose, "Uh, these Jews stink, I can't stand it." </sentence><sentence id="268">This of course is all in German. </sentence><sentence id="269">One time, we were assembled, and I always tried to make it my business to stay in a <span class="interior space">back row</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">We always had 3 or 4 rows of soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="271">I tried to stay in the <span class="interior space">back row</span> not to be conspicuous in any way. </sentence><sentence id="272">One time it just didn't happen, I was standing in the <span class="interior space">front row</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">And as the guards walked by, they stopped in front of me,

million people, we had about 60,000 Jews, there was nothing left, and all the big <span class="building">stores</span> that used to be owned by Jewish people are now, have now been taken over by the
