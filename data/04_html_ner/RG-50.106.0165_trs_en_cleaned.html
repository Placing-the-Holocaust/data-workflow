<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well, my father was educated as a lawyer, he had a degree from <span class="building">Warsaw law school</span>, and actually was in the same class as the former late Prime Minister of <span class="country">Israel</span>, Begin, although I'm not sure they knew each other, but around the time that my father graduated, which was coincidental with around the time I was born, that is the mid-30's, Polish a-anti-Semitism became much more pronounced in degrees. </sentence><sentence id="16">And as a result of that, he could not practice law in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I think he just managed real estate properties for my grandfather, including the one that we lived in, that I mentioned earlier. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: And wa -- did your mother work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="24">My mother, who is still alive, she was born in 1912, and so will be 93 this year, unhappily suffered from postpartum psychosis when I was born, so I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="25">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="26"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass " February 14, 2005 didn't see my mother -- although I didn't hear about this until much later, until around the time that I was two, two and a half. </sentence><sentence id="27">Although she re-recovered quite well, and in a very stressful time as we know war is for anyone, managed without any mental problems. </sentence><sentence id="28">She's had psychotic episodes since, but she's come back from all of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: How did your parents meet? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: I-In this climate of what might be called upper middle class, or even upper class Jews, there was -- e-everyone went to <span class="building">school</span> together, starting at a -- at a young age, in their -- their -- my parents are almost exactly the same age. </sentence><sentence id="40">And these -- Polish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was explained to me, people did not pair off until they married. </sentence><sentence id="41">So they did things in groups, went into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> to find -- excuse me -- edible mushrooms. </sentence><sentence id="42">Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in -- at the <span class="env feature">Baltic</span> in a <span class="building">resort</span> known as <span class="populated place">Sopot</span>, S-o-p-o-t. And then, in their early 20's they paired off and my parents paired off and married. </sentence><sentence id="43">I think my father was -- my parents were 22 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="44">My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or seven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not escape, they were -- they were in -- in the <span class="populated place">ge-German labor camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="45">And at that time, un-under Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="46">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="47"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass deg February 14, 2005 supposed to marry until your sisters married. </sentence><sentence id="48">So this was an elopement because it was a-against the tradition of the family. </sentence><sentence id="49">But somehow 1-it all worked out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: How would you describe your parents? </sentence><sentence id="64">Di -- wha -- were they re-religious? </sentence><sentence id="65">It sounds like maybe they weren't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Li-li -- my father was not an observant Jew, nor is my mother. </sentence><sentence id="70">However, they insisted that I have a Jewish education and I was -- at that time we didn't have Bar Mitzvahs, we had something called confirmation. </sentence><sentence id="71">So I went through about a seven year program at <span class="building">Temple Emmanuel</span> on <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span> and <span class="dlf">65" Street</span>, which started actually shortly after I arrived in the <span class="country">United States</span>, and ended when I was 13. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: So were they politically active in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: I wouldn't say so. </sentence><sentence id="78">My -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: L-I'm talking about the very early years in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Oh, in <span class="country">Poland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="88">There was no opportunity, other -- y-you know -- you -- you mean in terms of -- of the -- the <span class="populated place">Bund</span> or something like that? </sentence><sentence id="89">No. </sentence><sentence id="90">They -- they were not, at all, no. </sentence><sentence id="91">A-A-As the war approached, as -- strike that -- as it became clear, or clearer that <span class="country">Poland</span> was in jeopardy from an -- German attack, the Poles made some This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="92">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="93"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass deg February 14, 2005 decisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. </sentence><sentence id="94">Pole -- the Polish government passed a decree in -- I believe in the summer or spring of 1939, which was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost all of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-zlotys, held abroad by Poles, had to be repatriated and converted to Polish money, the <span class="spatial object">zloty</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">That law was, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. </sentence><sentence id="96">In fact, there is now quite a number of cases involving funds that were put in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> in secret accounts by precisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this situation and whose heirs are now either receiving or just seeking to prove that -- that these funds were theirs. </sentence><sentence id="97">But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums abroad in -- particularly in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and <span class="populated place">London</span>, i-in the order of millions of dollars. </sentence><sentence id="98">And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part because he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of this money was repatriated to <span class="country">Poland</span>, and there were no funds in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, there were no funds in any other place. </sentence><sentence id="99">So, when my parents eventually arrived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> with a one week visa to stay in the <span class="country">United States</span>, they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially destitute. </sentence><sentence id="100">Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World's Fair in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to get <span class="country">U.S.</span> visas to visit the World's Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="101">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="102"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass " February 14, 2005 could -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the <span class="building">World's Fair</span>, and you could take a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> from <span class="country">Poland</span> or from <span class="country">France</span> and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="103">My father proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign hi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the World's Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was sitting in <span class="populated place">New York</span> with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find a -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. </sentence><sentence id="104">But my grandfather vetoed the plan and I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the worse, had he said, all right, go to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and if they had arrived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> in that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Did your parents ever talk to you later about anti-Se-Semitism that they experienced when you were still too young, obviously to know about it, before September "39? </sentence><sentence id="124">Did they tell you of any incidents that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Well, as I said, he was unable to -- to practice hi -- the profession to which he was trained, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Any specific personal -- do you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="129">Very, very personal instances? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="130">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="131">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="132"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="133"> Interview with Andrew Glass deg February 14, 2005 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: I don't think so because they were living in -- in -- pretty much in isolation. </sentence><sentence id="135">Now, I put isolation in quotes because if you have a -- a million fellow Jews in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, you can find your way around. </sentence><sentence id="136">My father's resentment against <span class="country">Poland</span>, which he held until his death in 1993, was really centered around Polish anti-S- Semitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. </sentence><sentence id="137">And he wrote many letters, some to the <span class="building">New York Times</span>, some of -- of which were published, to the Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal. </sentence><sentence id="138">And so his - - his resentment was that [indecipherable] resentment is that the Poles aided and abetted the systematic slaughter of Polish Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: What is your very first memory? </sentence><sentence id="145">You said you were born in November "35, so what di -- can you recall the very first memory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yes, I remember as a very small child being in pa -- with -- not with my mother but with a -- a nursemaids in -- ah, there was a beautiful <span class="dlf">park</span> near where we lived called <span class="dlf">park Lazienki</span> which is still there, and I remember the peacocks in the <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">But one of my earliest memories is of the <span class="spatial object">Stuka dive bombers</span> bombing <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and the noise, and seeing the bombs fall on the <span class="populated place">city</span> and seeing the <span class="spatial object">bombers</span>, because they were -- dr-dropped their bombs from very low altitude and they would dive and then pull up and it was an extremely -- but the noise of the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="150">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="151"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass deg February 14, 2005 <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> and noise of the bombs made an impression for someone who was living in central <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: So we're talking about September deg39? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Exactly, we're talking about the first two weeks of September, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="159">And I have only very hazy memories of my -- our flight from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> east. </sentence><sentence id="160">Mos-Most of that is not recaptured memory so much as what I've been told by my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: No, it's obvious that we know that many of the things you're telling us when you -- before you were born obviously, and when you were very young is what you learned fro-from your -- your parents. </sentence><sentence id="165">Did -- did they tell you that they tried, besides the <span class="building">New York World's Fair</span>, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: No, my father was very much a man of the world, I mean he -- he tr -- had the Encyclopedia Britannica at <span class="building">home</span>, so he spoke some English, which was a -- a great benefit. </sentence><sentence id="169">He spoke Russian and German. </sentence><sentence id="170">He traveled some with my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was conceived on a cruise to the <span class="env feature">fjords</span> of <span class="country">Norway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">So he was a -- h- he -- the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> at that time -- and I remember my father telling me about listening to the speeches of Adolf Hitler on th-the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="173"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was not that far from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and everyone had a shortwave set so you could listen to -- to the German radio, and my father being fairly fluent in German could understand This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="175"> ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Andrew Glass me February 14, 2005 Hitler's speeches and how mesmerizing Hitler was, although he disagreed with, obviously with everything that he had to say. </sentence><sentence id="176">So they were ris -- I would say my father particularly but my mother as well, were resourceful people who, at a very critical stage in the war, in the first weeks of the war, took some dramatic steps to save their lives and my life. </sentence><sentence id="177">And we can talk about that if you like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Oh, that's funny, because when my mother was ill I spent a lot of time in my grandparent's <span class="building">home</span>, and that was the -- a poly -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Glot. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: <span class="building">Polyglot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="194"><span class="building">Polyglot household</span> with Polish, of course, but also English, French, German spoken, and I remember as one of my first memories actually, or -- 1-I -- I don't know if it's a memory or if it was reported back to me as that I asked my grandfather Jadush, which means grandfather in Polish, wh-when will I get my own language? </sentence><sentence id="195">The idea being that I had to converse with the nanny in French and with the maid in Polish and others in Russian and German and so I had -- I've never had a particularly strong facility for languages, but as a child I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: So now you're saying that your first recollection is when <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was being bombed, and did you -- again, you were so very young, but were your parents comforting, did they explain anything to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="202">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="203">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="204"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Andrew Glass " February 14, 2005 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="206">I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first week of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also Jewish, for both those reasons was not drafted into the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="207">But -- and the war began, either -- I'm not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft basis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, who- whose primary task was to fill sandbags around <span class="building">public buildings</span> and to clear the rubble from the German bombings. </sentence><sentence id="208">And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba -- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other <span class="building">public monuments</span> and <span class="building">buildings</span> being bombed in subsequent days. </sentence><sentence id="209">In any event this was almost a full-time job, he just was rarely <span class="building">home</span>, as that was reported to me. </sentence><sentence id="210">In about the 12" day of the war, he was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to be a taxi driver. </sentence><sentence id="211">And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both families to get the heck out of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, since the bombing was continuing and intensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not Polish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the artillery fire from three sides. </sentence><sentence id="212">So the problem was that the taxi driver didn't have any gas for his <span class="spatial object">taxi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite explain whether he had a stash of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew how on the <span class="building">black market</span> to get it, it was always fuzzy. </sentence><sentence id="214">But the bottom line is, my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="215">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="216"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 Interview with Andrew Glass " February 14, 2005 father procured gas for this <span class="spatial object">taxi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">So <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> plus gas meant that both families fled in the dawn hours of September 13". </sentence><sentence id="218">I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you can check it -- the -- the <span class="dlf">bridges</span> across the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span> were severed. </sentence><sentence id="219"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> itself held out against German attack until the end of the month. </sentence><sentence id="220">And some people also escaped by <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and so on and found ways out. </sentence><sentence id="221">But basically we left and traveled <span class="region">east</span>, around the time that that opportunity shut down. </sentence><sentence id="222">Others traveled south toward <span class="country">Romania</span> and survived, but we traveled due east until the <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> ran out of gas, and then we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse and <span class="spatial object">cart</span> and kept going east. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Let's talk a little bit more about your leaving <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">You again were very, very young. </sentence><sentence id="245">Do you remember that, and if so do you remember your emotions and the understanding of -- I mean, you were just a toddler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: I was just a toddler, I was just four, I only cou -- one can has -- have memories from that time, particularly if there's an abrupt change in your life, and I have very sh- shady memories of that time as -- but later on, that is a year later, we ended up across the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and I do remember living in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> quite clearly, and everything since then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Do you -- did your mother ever tell you what she brought with her -- when a family has to leave a <span class="building">home</span> like that so suddenly, what your folks took with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="253">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="254">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="255"> Interview with Andrew Glass 8 February 14, 2005 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, she did. </sentence><sentence id="257">They took nothing. </sentence><sentence id="258">And th-the -- in that there's a story, because my father's pants, with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of a -- a temporary exhibit at the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> some years ago on a group of about 2200 Polish Jews who fled, who were able to reach <span class="country">Japan</span>, and many of whom, not all, but many of whom survived because of that. </sentence><sentence id="259">And so the point of putting his pants in the <span class="spatial object">exhibit</span> was that that was the only thing he had and that was the only pants he ha -- he wore f-from the time that he left <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, I think, til the time he arrived in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were rather good pants, but they -- they saw a lot of adventure through the -- here and there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: D-Do you have any memory of that <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> ride with the other family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Very faintly. </sentence><sentence id="269">Just remember being picked up at -- somehow, and bundled in a -- in a crowded <span class="spatial object">black taxi</span> and remember crossing the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">I had never been to <span class="populated place">Praga</span>, which is the <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> that is directly east of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and so I think I have a slight memory of crossing the <span class="env feature">river</span>, but that's it. </sentence><sentence id="271">No, not really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you have a favorite <span class="spatial object">toy</span> with you, do you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
