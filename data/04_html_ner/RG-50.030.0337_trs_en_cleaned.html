<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: I'd like you to start by stating your name, your date of birth, where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is Herbert Katzki. </sentence><sentence id="3">I was born October 4, 1907 in <span class="populated place">Elizabeth</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">Most people don't know where <span class="populated place">Elizabeth</span> is, but there is such a place. </sentence><sentence id="5">I come from there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and personal background in terms of -- a <span class="building">religious home</span>, a politically active <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Well, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="13">I moved from <span class="populated place">Elizabeth</span> to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and it was in 1917. </sentence><sentence id="14">We -- it was a combination of <span class="building">households</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away. </sentence><sentence id="16">And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="17">And so we had to get along. </sentence><sentence id="18">My education was in the <span class="building">New York school system</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">I went to <span class="building">New York University</span>, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics. </sentence><sentence id="20">Went to <span class="building">school</span> at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="21">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a <span class="building">mercantile firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">Working in the <span class="building">credit department</span> decided me on becoming a credit man. </sentence><sentence id="23">And so in <span class="building">school</span>, I studied credits and collections. </sentence><sentence id="24">That was the subject of my major and accounting. </sentence><sentence id="25">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular <span class="building">firm</span> and went into the <span class="building">banking business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="27">Went into the <span class="building">Manufacturers Trust Company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">I started working for the <span class="building">Manufacturers Company</span> a few days before Black Friday in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I guess that probably influenced my career. </sentence><sentence id="30">Anyhow, I was with the <span class="building">bank</span> until 1936. </sentence><sentence id="31">They got looking around to see how things were going. </sentence><sentence id="32">Somebody suggested that I see the <span class="building">JDC</span>, <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing. </sentence><sentence id="33">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job. </sentence><sentence id="34">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years. </sentence><sentence id="35">That was a very long agreement. </sentence><sentence id="36">I worked in the <span class="building">New York headquarters office</span> of the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="37">Then until 1939 -- I was there until November. </sentence><sentence id="38">How come? </sentence><sentence id="39">The war began in September. </sentence><sentence id="40">It became apparent to me as it did to others that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="41">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="42"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="43"> circumstances will have changed in <span class="country">Europe</span>, and <span class="building">JDC</span> would need all the help it could over in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">I volunteered to go overseas. </sentence><sentence id="45">I was accepted, and I went overseas. </sentence><sentence id="46">And I arrived overseas in December 1939. </sentence><sentence id="47">My first permanent job, we thought would be in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, the <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T-1-0-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to <span class="country">Europe</span> at that time to join Mr. Troper. </sentence><sentence id="50">Joe Schwartz landed in <span class="country">Italy</span>, joined Troper, who was going to <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>, who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off. </sentence><sentence id="51">While they were overseas, war did ensue. </sentence><sentence id="52">While they were traveling around in <span class="country">Europe</span>, war did come along. </sentence><sentence id="53">That was in June 1940. </sentence><sentence id="54">They were traveling around. </sentence><sentence id="55">The Germans were practically knocking on the <span class="dlf">door</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was in charge of the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">It was the <span class="building">European headquarters</span>, I was in charge of the <span class="building">office</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="58">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the <span class="building">JDC</span> has to move its <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">It couldn't remain there. </sentence><sentence id="60">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> at the time, like <span class="building">ORT-HIAS</span>, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others. </sentence><sentence id="61">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the <span class="building">American Embassy</span>, who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> or not and so on. </sentence><sentence id="62">Decided to close up the <span class="building">office</span> and to move out. </sentence><sentence id="63">That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="64">I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="65">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">Closed the <span class="building">office</span>, moved -- intended originally to move to <span class="populated place">Tours</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">Couldn't go to <span class="populated place">Tours</span> because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to <span class="populated place">Tours</span>, and they occupied the <span class="populated place">city</span> to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in. </sentence><sentence id="68">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the <span class="building">office</span>, I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">They came in Monday to leave the <span class="building">office</span> with their <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> and so on, and they went over to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="71">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="72"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="73"> I came there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other <span class="building">agencies</span> we decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us. </sentence><sentence id="74">And the <span class="building">JDC</span> was the only Jewish organization, welfare organization, in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, all by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="75">Well, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Troper came back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> on Monday. </sentence><sentence id="76">The rest of the staff had left. </sentence><sentence id="77">I had kept the <span class="building">office</span> open. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">There were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two gentlemen who came back. </sentence><sentence id="79">We closed down the -- closed down the <span class="building">shop</span> on Tuesday, and the Germans came in on Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="80">As I said, we've started out for <span class="populated place">Tours</span>, we couldn't get in, had to change directions. </sentence><sentence id="81">We ended up in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">We moved the <span class="building">JDC headquarters</span> over to <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Can I interrupt you here. </sentence><sentence id="84">I have a question. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: You were in <span class="country">Europe</span> already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had started -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: -- in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">What was the mood? </sentence><sentence id="91">What did you think was going to happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: The mood in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the <span class="dlf">Champs Elysees</span>, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="96">And you couldn't tell by looking around the <span class="dlf">streets</span> that anything was happening at all. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="98">Well, it was misplaced, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="99">So that -- we ended up, then, in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">We moved the <span class="building">office</span> down there. </sentence><sentence id="101">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in <span class="country">Europe</span> with which we had been operating to tell them where our new <span class="building">office</span> was in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, to discover later on that the <span class="populated place">center</span> had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out. </sentence><sentence id="102">They were held up by the center, by the military people in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">We were in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span> (ph) for about four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="104">Government in the meantime had moved down to <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to let the French know that they're still around. </sentence><sentence id="107">And the French, then, had sat down This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and said, "Anybody who wants to leave <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out." </sentence><sentence id="110">So we were there. </sentence><sentence id="111">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">We decided to get out. </sentence><sentence id="113">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, just to get out of <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">As a matter of fact, the <span class="dlf">road</span> were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who were coming down from <span class="country">Belgium</span> into <span class="country">France</span>, and from <span class="region">Northern France</span> going down to <span class="region">Southern France</span> -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>, it took us three days to get down there. </sentence><sentence id="115">The <span class="dlf">roads</span> were that crowded with refugees. </sentence><sentence id="116">And we had hardships along the <span class="dlf">road</span> too, ran out of gasoline and <span class="building">shelter</span> and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="117">So we decided then to get out of <span class="populated place">Bordeaux</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">We did that and headed for <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> and decided that the <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in <span class="region">European territory</span>, and that's the place to have the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">That was all right because the <span class="country">United States</span> was not yet in the war. </sentence><sentence id="120">This was in -- when we went to <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, that was in June, July 1940. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, and that's where we were going to make our new <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">I went back to <span class="populated place">Marseille</span> after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the <span class="building">JDC</span> could do with the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the <span class="region">north</span> and from <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">Decided that there was work that the <span class="building">JDC</span> could do, and I opened up the <span class="building">office</span> for the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">Marseille</span> for unoccupied <span class="country">France</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: I want to backtrack a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Because I have a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="159">In 1939 and 1940 before <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was occupied -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Where were your efforts directed? </sentence><sentence id="162">Where were the <span class="building">JDC</span> -- were you sending money into <span class="country">Germany</span> or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="164">Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167">We had worked out an arrangement with the <span class="spatial object">German Rifentrajung</span> (ph) and the <span class="building">German Hoopsverine</span> (ph), which were the agencies in <span class="country">Germany</span> with which we worked, whereby they would collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the <span class="country">United</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="168">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="169"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">They would collect them in <span class="populated place">Marks</span>, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars. </sentence><sentence id="171">Consequently our dollars did not go into <span class="country">Germany</span>, but the counter-value of local currency, which was already in <span class="country">Germany</span>, was made available to the <span class="building">agency</span> with which we operated. </sentence><sentence id="172">So if you ask if we sent money in, we did not. </sentence><sentence id="173">We operated that kind of a transaction. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when <span class="country">Austria</span> was over-- <span class="building">office</span> was the anschluss, we did the same thing with <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">And in due course we even worked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">We didn't send money into <span class="country">Poland</span> either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: You went over with this purpose? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier. </sentence><sentence id="191">I went over as a -- as a generalist, who happened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over. </sentence><sentence id="192">I went over, as I say, as a generalist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Is that what -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: You ask what did we do out of <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, since we were not in the war, and <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> was neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been in contact with, by phone or mail or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="199">But of course, by mail we would not have tried to get in touch -- or any other way -- with <span class="country">Germany</span>, because anything that a name like Jewish, who would have been -- tripped us ___ in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the same thing with <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">But with the other <span class="country">countries</span> we could still work. </sentence><sentence id="202">There weren't many <span class="country">countries</span> left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything. </sentence><sentence id="203">So that while we were at liberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Now, being that you were in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> than the people back in the <span class="country">United States</span> had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> -- back in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> in 1943 -- that we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, which later became known. </sentence><sentence id="211">We did not -- I did not know that in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">We This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="213">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="214"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection didn't have that information. </sentence><sentence id="215">The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by Riegner from <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>, and it got over to the <span class="building">State Department</span> through the help of the <span class="building">American Mission</span> in <span class="populated place">Berne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that were coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that proof. </sentence><sentence id="217">Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="218">But in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it. </sentence><sentence id="219">They didn't know it either. </sentence><sentence id="220">They had no reporters running around loose, going into the <span class="populated place">camps</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="221">So we didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="222">And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were suppressed. </sentence><sentence id="223">So the information wasn't generally known. </sentence><sentence id="224">So we worked then. </sentence><sentence id="225">We stayed in contact, which was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the war, and then we were fighting with <span class="country">Germany</span> and with <span class="country">Austria</span>, and the Italians came in in June 1941. </sentence><sentence id="226">And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="227">We had to find other ways then for remaining in contact and communicating with them. </sentence><sentence id="228">We got in touch with a man in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">You may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph). </sentence><sentence id="230">His name keeps coming up. </sentence><sentence id="231">He lived in up in <span class="populated place">St.Gallen</span> in <span class="region">North Switzerland</span>, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare organization. </sentence><sentence id="232">And he agreed temporarily to act for the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">He finally gave up that position with the <span class="building">Swiss agency</span> in order to devote all his time to <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">So he became <span class="building">JDC</span>'s representative in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these <span class="country">countries</span> which the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he was in contact with <span class="country">Hungary</span>, with <span class="country">Romania</span>, and even with <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, with <span class="country">France</span>, occupied, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="236">And he did the things for us. </sentence><sentence id="237">Communication with <span class="populated place">Soudymiah</span> was easy enough by <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">From <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was all right. </sentence><sentence id="240">You just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross <span class="country">France</span>, that was <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">Do it by___; they were more liberal. </sentence><sentence id="242">And you could make your telephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">So that's how we kept in touch, then, with the <span class="country">countries</span> with which the <span class="building">JDC</span> -- which the <span class="country">United States</span> ultimately was in war with. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: What about in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: Inthe <span class="populated place">camps</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1079">There were rabbis in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, who were among the internees -- is that the right word to use? -- </sentence><sentence id="1080">in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> itself. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And if there was no rabbi, there would be people -- men, who were sufficiently educated in Hebrew that they could conduct the service. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And you may know, in the Jewish religion you don't have to be ordained to conduct a service. </sentence><sentence id="1083">A lay person can do that too. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And so that was done in many of the places where there -- in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, where they needed a quasi-religious functionary to run the services. </sentence><sentence id="1085">But the <span class="building">JDC</span> provided funds. </sentence><sentence id="1086">You probably heard a story from <span class="populated place">Tetfear</span> (ph) about a <span class="building">mikvah</span>. </sentence><sentence

wanted to make his own. </sentence><sentence id="1091">All right. </sentence><sentence id="1092">So finally a <span class="building">mikvah</span> was built for him by the <span

and the water, because our guy went up into the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and brought snow back, but it was pure water. </sentence><sentence id="1099">You had to do that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And then in the <span class="populated place">communities</span> themselves there was a <span class="building">business</span> -- we had to start <span class="building">Sunday school</span> classes. </sentence><sentence id="1101">We imported staff from <span class="country">Israel</span> to do that sort of thing with <span class="building">Sunday school</span> classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish backgrounds and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1102">We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1103">We felt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into bricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1104">You couldn't feed them bricks and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And so we didn't do too much of that. </sentence><sentence id="1106">But where something was mobile, anything that a person could carry with them, that, we were interested in doing. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Health, they could carry with them; education, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with them -- good for the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1108">But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the <span class="dlf">graveyards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1109">You can't take that with you. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could do that. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Family members or people from the same <span class="populated place">town</span> or something could do that. </sentence><sentence id="1112">We had other things to do with our funds. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And so then I was in <span class="country">Germany</span>, then, for a year with our program there. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Then I went back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and undertook other functions there. </sentence><sentence id="1115">For awhile I filled in a blank in the <span class="building">immigration department</span> of the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1116">The immigration, that was really a tough business, because -- as you have heard -- everybody wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And you had people in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>; <span class="country">Poland</span>, <span class="country">Romania</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1118">They were all to come to <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1120">Nobody would let people in. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Even to come to the <span class="country">United States</span>, visas were issued in the order of priority of your registration. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And according to priorities in <span class="country">Poland</span>, you could have waited for eight years or ten years before you had ____, because it was all done on a quota basis. </sentence><sentence id="1123">So everybody wanted to come down to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1124"><span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1131">Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1132">At that time the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were all clogged up. </sentence><sentence id="1133">There were no <span class="spatial object">passenger boats</span> going between Europe and the <span class="country">United States</span> at that ttme. </sentence><sentence id="1134">When I say "no," sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And there was a great deal of competition to get on those <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So there were so many places that we could get. </sentence><sentence id="1137">So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, because the authorities in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> were after us, to keep the influx down. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And so they had to stay back. </sentence><sentence id="1139">On one occasion we had to take a whole <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Shohan Newbit</span> (ph), to send that to <span class="country">Australia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and send the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> down to <span class="country">Australia</span> to get them down there. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And so we were in the <span class="building">immigration business</span> starting -- as I told you -- until 1954. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were involved with immigration merged, which included the <span class="building">JDC</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="1143">So that took us out of the immigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow -- at least took it out of our <span class="building">office</span> and took the responsibility away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Another operation that we had was the <span class="building">American Joint Reconstruction Foundation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1145">The foundation was established during the wars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who couldn't go to the <span class="building">bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1146"><span class="building">Banks</span> wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so exorbitant. </sentence><sentence id="1147">So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these <span class="building">cooperative banks</span> were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the place, all over <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>, had these foundations. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And then of course, there were people who couldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these <span class="building">local banks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So we opened up free <span class="building">loan societies</span> and provided the <span class="populated place">capital</span> for that. </sentence><sentence id="1150">As I said before, anything that you touched, the <span class="building">JDC</span> was in there
