class="building">school</span> and uh we had a very comfortable existence. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was good living in those days in in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was really was a good life, a good wholesome life. </sentence><sentence id="36">And uh we had a good social life and uh my brothers were...I'm the youngest of the boys and had three little sisters, and uh we all loved one another. </sentence><sentence id="37">Everything was fine, until...until uh 1938 I really did not believe...comprehend what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="38">I remember my mother keep saying, don't be outside too long. </sentence><sentence id="39">Come on <span class="building">home</span> and and uh when you go to the <span class="dlf">schul</span> (ph), the <span class="building">temple</span>, come right back <span class="building">home</span> and we kept the holidays and we had a all around good life and uh people

all...failed to understand the significance of the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="41">Uh we weren't allowed to uh go to <span class="building">movies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">We weren't' allowed to go to the <span class="building">zoo</span>...Jews uh not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="43">We weren't allowed to uh go shopping in <span class="building">stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">We used to go to a <span class="building">store</span> to buy something. </sentence><sentence id="45">We had to wait till everybody was served. </sentence><sentence id="46">We were always the last one to get what we want, if we were lucky enough to get it. </sentence><sentence id="47">And by by the time I was eleven, twelve years old, I was thrown out of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">Well, there there was a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> in my uh <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, in <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span> (ph), but there were so many Jewish kids that they didn't have enough <span class="interior space">room</span> for all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we only could go to <span class="building">school</span> maybe two hours a week or three hours a week in shifts. </sentence><sentence id="50">And we had all this...I took stride. </sentence><sentence id="51">I just didn't...1 really didn't understand this whole thing, and nobody else really explained anything to us. </sentence><sentence id="52">They would try to keep it away from us...until uh 1938. </sentence><sentence id="53">The week before Kristallnacht when they start to arrest all the Jews of Polish background origin, they deported them. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh the children were in <span class="building">school</span> and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the <span class="building">houses</span> cooking and things, and just were arrested, one after another, put to...not not given time uh to pack anything. </sentence><sentence id="55">Took them to <span class="spatial object">trains</span>...the father in one <span class="spatial object">train</span>, the mother in the other <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56"> Nobody knew where anybody was and the children came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">The place was padlocked. </sentence><sentence id="58">They sat outside, didn't know what was happening to them. </sentence><sentence id="59">Then they grabbed the children, put them on another <span class="spatial object">train</span> until they they worked it out, what was happening and everybody started running for the em...<span class="building">consulate</span>, the <span class="building">embassies</span>, because the <span class="building">embassies</span>...they couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="60">They were safe there. </sentence><sentence id="61">So they went to the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">They went to the <span class="building">American Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">They went to the <span class="building">Russian Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">They went to the Danish, Norwegian, <span class="country">Swiss</span>...anything that was near. </sentence><sentence id="65">So our job was to bring food to these people and take messages, because if the wife was in the <span class="building">Danish Embassy</span> and the husband was in the in the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>, we just took messages back and forth trying to seek the families out to tell them that their loved ones were alright. </sentence><sentence id="66">That went on for a couple of days, and uh the night...the 8th of November...I believe it was the 9th or the 8th...8th or 9th of November I believe...I never forgot...the uh the uh Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="67">That is when I really really was hit with the uh with the happenings there. </sentence><sentence id="68">They came to our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">They broke everything up and like that in every other <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">They were raping the young girls in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and and dragging men by their beards through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and burning down the <span class="building">temples</span> and and and and and threw...1 remember they threw all our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and <span class="spatial object">dishes</span> and everything out the <span class="dlf">window</span> and and and uh beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="71">They came in...the Hitler youth...with their daggers, blood and honor, and punks, bands of punks and they're beating everybody up, taking people to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, arresting people and it was just a terrible, terrible night. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="75">Of course, there was still <span class="building">home</span>...I was still <span class="building">home</span>, my three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were hiding in one of the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> but they dragged us out, beat up my mother and the next day it was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="77">The smoke was still coming out of the <span class="building">buildings</span> of the <span class="building">temples</span> and the <span class="building">schules</span> and <span class="building">houses</span> and there was still blood in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">Now I knew...now I knew...something terrible is happening. </sentence><sentence id="79">But I didn't know what to do about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">1 had my mama. </sentence><sentence id="81">I had my mother. </sentence><sentence id="82">She was always taking care of us. ( </sentence><sentence id="83">Sigh) Well, my brother Paul to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="84">My other brother went to <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">They were taken, and a few days later they came to our <span class="building">house</span> from a Jewish organization and they said we can save one child. </sentence><sentence id="86">Which one is going to live and which ones are going to die? ( </sentence><sentence id="87">Sigh) My mother had to make a choice and by the time the choice was made and everything, the other one was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="88">Was just left me and my three little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="89">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="90">A couple of months passed and my mother sent me out for a loaf of bread and I never came back. </sentence><sentence id="91">A <span class="spatial object">car</span> came screeching to a halt...are you a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="92">I was sixteen years old...fifteen, sixteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="93">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="94">I didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="95">These were mean looking men. </sentence><sentence id="96">They put me into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and I found myself in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">No explanation was given. </sentence><sentence id="98">None was asked. </sentence><sentence id="99">I remember the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, <span class="building">cell</span> number ten. </sentence><sentence id="100">My mother wondered what happened to me...send me out for a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="101">I was in <span class="building">jail</span> about...I would say about two months, three months...till May, approximately May. </sentence><sentence id="102">Suddenly they let me go free. </sentence><sentence id="103">I had to sign a paper that I was going to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> within forty-eight hours...they will let me go, and that I was treated well. </sentence><sentence id="104">Again I didn't know what I was signing. </sentence><sentence id="105">They told me to sign. </sentence><sentence id="106">I signed. </sentence><sentence id="107">And I went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">I remember to this day...my mother stay...stood at the <span class="dlf">door</span> of our apart...our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">She had ten marks...that was all we were allowed to take. </sentence><sentence id="110">Ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="111">She must have had this in cash laying around because all our money had been confiscated by the  state, and we had nothing left and she said to me, you have to leave <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">Don't even go into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">You have to leave <span class="building">home</span> right now. </sentence><sentence id="114">Here is ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="115">She says go to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116"><span class="country">Italy</span> was the only <span class="country">country</span> that had open <span class="dlf">borders</span> because they are friends with . </sentence><sentence id="117">Hitler was the leader. </sentence><sentence id="118">They were friends. </sentence><sentence id="119">They had no closed <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">And that was the only <span class="country">country</span> that had an open <span class="dlf">border</span> for Germans. </sentence><sentence id="121">I had no passport. </sentence><sentence id="122">I had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="124">Here...take the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, she says. </sentence><sentence id="125">Here is a card, a railroad ticket I got for you. </sentence><sentence id="126">Take the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and go into <span class="country">Italy</span> and just one by one...don't ever look back. </sentence><sentence id="127">So I said to her where are my other two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="128">I had three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="129">She said they're on their way to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">I sent them with some people, with some friends to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">Only Toni (ph), the little one, she had in her arm. </sentence><sentence id="132">Must have been about...I don't know...four, three, four years old. </sentence><sentence id="133">So I said goodbye...I was a good boy so I said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="134">Mamma said go...I go. </sentence><sentence id="135">And uh that is when my life started. </sentence><sentence id="136">I went to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">I took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> into <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Where was your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: He went into a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: When he was taken there...Kristallnacht? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="257">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="258">Now my mother was alone with my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="259">How my mother ever got me out of that <span class="building">jail</span> I will never know to this day. </sentence><sentence id="260">I am sure she must have bribed a lot of people to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="261">But she saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="262">So where does one go? </sentence><sentence id="263">One goes to <span class="populated place">Milano</span> (ph), <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">In <span class="populated place">Milano</span>, arriving in <span class="populated place">Milan</span>...we had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="265">I wasn't the only one. </sentence><sentence id="266">There were hundreds...men, women, children...anyone who could themselves, they went down there. ( </sentence><sentence id="267">Sigh) We had no food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="268">We had no place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="269">We slept on <span class="spatial object">park benches</span>, in <span class="dlf">doorways</span>, in <span class="dlf">parks</span>, and we like a <span class="dlf">hole</span>, like rats. </sentence><sentence id="270">So the Jews of <span class="populated place">Milan</span>, they got together and they opened up <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span> and they got organized and so at least we could have one meal a day, somewhat of a meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="271">That was done for a while, a week, two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="272">Then the Germans found out that the Jews are treated to some...to a meal a day, and they they made arrangements with the Italian authorities because we told the Italians that we were tourists, otherwise you couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="273">We were tourists. </sentence><sentence id="274">So they let us in. </sentence><sentence id="275">And now they said if you're tourists, then you've got to have money and if you have money, you don't need any <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span>, and if you're not tourists, then we have to send you back where you came from. </sentence><sentence id="276">Made a lot of sense to them...didn't make any sense to us though. </sentence><sentence id="277">They closed up the <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">That was the end of food. </sentence><sentence id="279">more than one meal a day. </sentence><sentence id="280">So another few days and uh like I always was, I used to climb into the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, some <span class="interior space">backyards</span>, and pluck some fresh figs. ( </sentence><sentence id="281">Laughter) I...I stole some olives from <span class="env feature">trees</span>, but there was to steal. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was edible and to stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="283">Then the word got around that <span class="country">France</span> will let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="284">The men have to go to the French Army,  because war was eminent, and the women had to volunteer for the <span class="building">French Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">We said wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="286">We all went to the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>, and we all got that...the one day flag they call it. </sentence><sentence id="287">We got a visa to enter <span class="country">France</span> that was good for 24 hours only. </sentence><sentence id="288">Well, there was only <span class="spatial object">train</span> going to the <span class="dlf">French border</span> because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that. </sentence><sentence id="289">We had to get that <span class="spatial object">train</span> and they gave us a <span class="spatial object">train</span> ticket so we went for that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">Now what that <span class="spatial object">train</span> looked like you will never know. </sentence><sentence id="291">They were hanging out of the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">They were laying on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span>...inside...outside. </sentence><sentence id="293">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="294">They...they...they held children out out the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">There was <span class="interior space">room</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="296">They were suffocating inside. </sentence><sentence id="297">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that is good for three hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="298">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> took off. </sentence><sentence id="299">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">They were hanging out <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">Outside...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails. </sentence><sentence id="302">People fell off, actually fell off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> while the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was moving so the <span class="spatial object">train</span> conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="303">By the time we got to the <span class="dlf">Italian/French border</span>, it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="304">The French had closed the <span class="dlf">border</span> and there's a little piece of <span class="region">land</span> called <span class="dlf">no man's land</span> and the Italians wouldn't let us back. </sentence><sentence id="305">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="306">So we laid on that little piece <span class="region">land</span>...there was a <span class="populated place">fishing village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">.St. </sentence><sentence id="308"><span class="populated place">Reno__</span>...it's right on the <span class="dlf">border</span>. . </sentence><sentence id="309">It's right on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, and these old fishermen with these old <span class="spatial object">boats</span>...they saw a way to make money. </sentence><sentence id="310">Now these were impoverished people that never had anything except to catch a few fish now and then. </sentence><sentence id="311">So they said to us, we'll take you around the bent...it's a big <span class="env feature">rock</span>...and you had to go around the bent onto the <span class="env feature">beaches</span> of <span class="country">France</span> if you give us everything you have and uh pay us whatever you can pay, and we'll load up the <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">We'll take you. </sentence><sentence id="313">But what they didn't tell people, that the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> were old and that the breakers in the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> were very strong onto the onto the uh __, unto the stone, unto the uh onto the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">The <span class="env feature">mountain</span> came back out of the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">The <span class="env feature">waves</span> were high and very strong and very uh uh dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="316">So as greedy as they were, they overloaded the <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">Some people had a wedding band, an engagement ring, maybe a few francs, maybe a few lire, maybe a little piece of jewelry that they saved, that they smuggled out. </sentence><sentence id="318">They overloaded. </sentence><sentence id="319">They gave them everything they owned. </sentence><sentence id="320">They overloaded the <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">They went out a little bit, and the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> broke in two. </sentence><sentence id="322">They capsized. </sentence><sentence id="323">They broke in two. </sentence><sentence id="324">The fishermen swam back. </sentence><sentence id="325">He has been fishing...he has been swimming since he was two years old, so there were people that couldn't swim. </sentence><sentence id="326">Now you tell me...who do you save when you're a father and and your little girl says Daddy, save me, and your little boy says Papa, save me. </sentence><sentence id="327">And your wife is drowning. </sentence><sentence id="328">Who do you save...and you can't swim, and the <span class="env feature">waves</span> are high. </sentence><sentence id="329">The next day the the bodies came washing ashore. </sentence><sentence id="330">And there were two <span class="spatial object">boats</span> out there, two uh <span class="spatial object">gun boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">A French one and an <span class="spatial object">Italian gunboat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="332">And the the personnel on these <span class="spatial object">boats</span>, they were looking out and they saw the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="333">Nobody lifted their finger to help. </sentence><sentence id="334">The screams of help, please help, help my children, help my wife, uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day. </sentence><sentence id="335">Nobody cared. </sentence><sentence id="336">I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me, you know about your brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="337">I says what. </sentence><sentence id="338">He got out. </sentence><sentence id="339">He went to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">The word got out. </sentence><sentence id="341">He was married. </sentence><sentence id="342">He had a twenty year old wife and he had a one year old baby. </sentence><sentence id="343">I said you know what happened to Judy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="344">Have you heard and had any word. </sentence><sentence id="345">He says yes. </sentence><sentence id="346">He tried to smuggle them out into <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">He paid smugglers to bring them out. </sentence><sentence id="348"> The smugglers took all their...what they owned in the middle of the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and abandoned them. </sentence><sentence id="349">The baby started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="350">The Germans got them and hang them. </sentence><sentence id="351">They hang _ fromthe _ wife and baby next to her. </sentence><sentence id="352">They were found like that. </sentence><sentence id="353">I said anything you know about my brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="354">He says yes. </sentence><sentence id="355">He went half crazy.

</sentence><sentence id="982">I did. </sentence><sentence id="983">We went into a <span class="building">farmhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="984">We said to the guys...all we could speak was German. </sentence><sentence id="985">We couldn't speak French. </sentence><sentence id="986">We couldn't speak no other language. </sentence><sentence id="987">Nobody talks because if you speak German, the French hate the _, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="988">They're going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="989">Nobody talked. </sentence><sentence id="990">We get caught, nobody talks. </sentence><sentence id="991">We went into the <span class="building">chicken house</span> to steal some eggs. </sentence><sentence id="992">The chickens carried on. </sentence><sentence id="993">You would not believe the noise they made. </sentence><sentence id="994">The farmer came out. </sentence><sentence id="995">Two farmers came out in fact, with pitch forks. </sentence><sentence id="996">They found us. </sentence><sentence id="997">They would have put those <span class="spatial object">pitch forks</span> right through us because food was always scarce. </sentence><sentence id="998">They didn't...they didn't appreciate anybody stealing their eggs or chickens for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="999">I tell you we never run so fast in our lives over the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1000">After a few miles out there, we start eating some of the wine, the grapes that grow in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, but the farmers put a chemical on those grapes uh so the flies and things don't uh spoil them. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They gave us diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We got sick from them. </sentence><sentence id="1003">It was a bad situation, believe me. </sentence><sentence id="1004">We finally made it to <span class="populated place">Neim</span> (ph), and we went to <span class="populated place">Langlade</span> two at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The others stayed in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Only two at a time traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1007">We went to <span class="populated place">Langlade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1008">There was a small <span class="populated place">village</span>, small <span class="populated place">French village</span>, and...a deserted <span class="populated place">village</span>, nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Empty...just the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1012">We joined them. </sentence><sentence id="1013">They were...they already were better armed, better trained, smarter in in in the things they had to do. </sentence><sentence id="1014">After about a week or so we were surrounded...somebody must have gotten wind of it...by the gendarmes, the French gendarmes, and they asked us to give up. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Well,  0 we knew we were in the south of <span class="country">France</span>, and you remember well that <span class="country">France</span> was occupied only half and the other one was <span class="populated place">Vichy</span> controlled, <span class="populated place">Marshall</span> and 3 you know about that. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So at least we knew we were in the south of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1017">You always had to go <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1018">So we got together, said look, all the young guys, guys like, you know, fifteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...make a run for it over the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1019">We're going to shoot out at the <span class="building">gendarmes</span> on one side, and you run on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1020">We keep them busy on one side. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So we said what's going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="1022">They said don't worry about us. </sentence><sentence id="1023">We are older guys. </sentence><sentence id="1024">We expect it...we expected this anytime to happen, so it happen now. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Maybe we'll get away too. </sentence><sentence id="1026">But we'll fight it out. </sentence><sentence id="1027">We...we're going to give them a run for their money. </sentence><sentence id="1028">In the meantime you make a run for it, all the young kids, make a run for it, because you're the ones that can run. </sentence><sentence id="1029">We can't. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And believe me, we got good at running. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Sure enough, they started the firing and he says go and we went, and we run over the <span class="dlf">fields</span> while they keep the gendarmes busy. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And the French aren't anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We found that out. </sentence><sentence id="1034">They they're not too bright. </sentence><sentence id="1035">They're cruel. </sentence><sentence id="1036">They're barbaric, but they're not bright. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And where will you go? </sentence><sentence id="1038">You're running through the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Where will you go? </sentence><sentence id="1040">Naturally...Nice. </sentence><sentence id="1041">That's the answer...<span class="populated place">Nice</span>, toward the <span class="dlf">Italian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1042"><span class="populated place">Nice</span> is toward the <span class="dlf">Italian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I end up in <span class="populated place">Nice</span> and what the French did...they would close up a part of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Suddenly three or four <span class="spatial

no papers. </sentence><sentence id="1045">You had to show papers. </sentence><sentence id="1046">You had to show passports. </sentence><sentence id="1047">You had to show money that you are not a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1143">A: I was by myself. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I didn't know these things that they did there. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And of course I was caught. </sentence><sentence id="1146">So what they do...they put me into this . </sentence><sentence id="1147">There is a , you know, the _, a <span class="dlf">park</span>, an <span class="dlf">army

</sentence><sentence id="1149">The others they put in other <span class="building">jails</span> that they caught. </sentence><sentence id="1150">To...to me no papers, no money, no past, no present, no future. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I couldn't speak a word of French and I was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I said what more can happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They put into into a <span class="interior space">cell</span> by myself...one day, two days, three days, and the <span class="building">jail</span> was right...it was a <span class="building">jail</span> and a little <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> and the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1154">The <span class="dlf">street</span> was like this. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So I was watching. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I II became observant. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I could <span class="building">shop</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1158">When they put me into that <span class="building">jail</span>, I kept walking slower, I kept sizing up the place. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I was looking around to see how many <span class="interior space">cells</span> there, see what...where the <span class="dlf">wall</span> is, see what's behind the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, uh see how the <span class="interior space">cell</span> closes...I became very, very observant. </sentence><sentence id="1160">One day the guard came around. </sentence><sentence id="1161">He says, well, he says, one morning, tomorrow you're going to be handed over to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1162">They're going to pick all you Jews up. </sentence><sentence id="1163">Well that night I counted the time the guard would make the rounds. </sentence><sentence id="1164">It was about ten minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I counted...one, two, three, four, five minute passed...one minute, two minute, three minute, four minute. </sentence><sentence id="1166">About ten minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1167">There was a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="interior space">cell</span> with a little <span class="dlf">trap door</span> where they put that thing in where you urinate in, and that was closed with a piece of wire. </sentence><sentence id="1168">They just place...put a piece of <span class="dlf">wire</span> through it and wrap it around. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They say you couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I noticed that. </sentence><sentence id="1171">He left. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I went up, pulled that thing  1 out and I worked the <span class="dlf">wire</span> back and forth till it broke. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I worked it up. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Every time they came by, I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1175">He went. </sentence><sentence id="1176">The moment he left I had the <span

in. </sentence><sentence id="1181">It was a pathetic view. </sentence><sentence id="1182">When I tell you it was pitiful...they were loaded with people that they caught here and there, that they arrested, waiting, so I said you know, you got eight minutes to go over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Eight minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Now it's seven minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Get the hell out. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Move. </sentence><sentence id="1187">Get over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I got them all out to the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1189">I said get out, get out. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I want to talk to you. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1191">They all came out. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I said come on. </sentence><sentence id="1193">See that <span class="dlf">wall</span>...make it...make a go for it. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Go, go. </sentence><sentence id="1195">You had to...if you have to die, die fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1196">At least try. </sentence><sentence id="1197">They looked at me and they said where are we going to go. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Nobody wants us. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Nobody's going to help us. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Where do you want us to go? </sentence><sentence id="1201">Well, I knew I only had a few minutes left and I said look, I don't know about you but I'm going over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I climbed...I went to the <span class="dlf">wall</span> which was no big deal, but they had this little piece of glass on the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1204">I went in between but I cut myself anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Outside the <span class="dlf">wall</span> was a <span class="dlf">lamp post</span> and outside there was a <span class="spatial object">car</span> going back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1206">I looked right on top of them. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I waited until the _ walked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="1208">I jumped onto the <span class="dlf">lamp post</span>, went down and start walking immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I didn't even stay...I didn't give him a chance that he would...where this guy come. </sentence><sentence id="1210">I just...I never saw him...I just a minute ago...where'd he come from. </sentence><sentence id="1211">I walked. </sentence><sentence id="1212">He didn't say a word to me. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I nodded to him. </sentence><sentence id="1214">He smiled at me and I kept on going. </sentence><sentence id="1215">The moment I was a few hundred feet away, I started running like the dickens just to get away from that place. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Two guys stopped me. </sentence><sentence id="1217">One guy said to me if you're on the tun, if you're a Jew and you're on the run, three <span class="dlf">blocks</span> down is a <span class="building">school</span>, a <span

did. </sentence><sentence id="1223">I went into the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1224">They took me in. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1225">There must have been a hundred guys there, hiding in this <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And he said to me you can stay maybe two days, maybe three. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Then you have to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for somebody else that needs a piece of bread or that needs to get a night's sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So somehow we started to get organized a little. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Somebody...you see, it was a big thing when...if you could get a night's sleep without having to worry or if you get a piece of bread without having to sleep with your with your stomach empty. </sentence><sentence id="1230">That was a big thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1231">Or or if somebody gave you piece of blanket and you got warm for a change. </sentence><sentence id="1232">That was a big thing. </sentence><sentence id="1233">You could let go of fear and of and of of nerves and of and and of being so frightened, and and this so cold all the time and so hungry all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1234">You could let go of it a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1235">You could lay down, say ah...I just want to sleep a few hours without having to worry somebody putting a bayonet in my back or a gun to my head. </sentence><sentence id="1236">It lasted a few days and said look, I have to make <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I got out. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I got caught again. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Got no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1240">There was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1241">This time they took me to a <span class="dlf">Ausglis Sur Mer</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1242">Well Ausglis...naturally in chains with dozens of others. </sentence><sentence id="1243"><span class="dlf">Ausglis Sur Mer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1244">They put us into, into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was another <span class="building">tent</span> with <span class="dlf">barbed

thirteen. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Look _. </sentence><sentence id="1248">There's two boys going to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1249">That's your life there. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Make the most of it. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Nobody really understood the significance of being shot. </sentence><sentence id="1252"> 2 Somehow we didn't even...we couldn't comprehend it. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Only the fewest mentally could comprehend it. ( </sentence><sentence id="1254">Pause) Next day came...nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Night came...nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Day came...nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1257">They threw in one bread like this was food was in for the day, and the others break a piece for this one and a piece for that one. </sentence><sentence id="1258">Threw some <span class="env

docked nearby and uh the <span class="spatial object">guard du mobile</span> was on each side and we had to go through the <span class="dlf">line</span>, you know what I'm trying to say, through the <span class="dlf">line</span> between the <span class="spatial object">guard du mobile</span>, be...between the gendarmes, and as we went through all chained together, they would beat us and kick us and spit at us. </sentence><sentence id="1259">Some fell down and we had to drag them with us because they're chained together, to get onto the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1260">It was pitiful. </sentence><sentence id="1261">It was really pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1262">We had never seen...we had never harmed these people. </sentence><sentence id="1263">We never saw these people. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Finally the captain of the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> came out and he told them to stop.

by anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1266">They're under my <span class="region">jurisdiction</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Now let these people go. </sentence><sentence id="1268">He was a nice man, the captain. </sentence><sentence id="1269">We went on the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and there was a <span class="dlf">hole</span> on the <span class="interior

</sentence><sentence id="1271">That was the only way you could get out. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And the the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> took off. </sentence><sentence id="1273">We had no idea where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Some people, the older guys told us...they looked through the, you know, uh openings in the in the belly of the <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="1289">We had very little food, and there was just no way that we ever found out what was going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1290">We lost...we lost uh uh track of time. </sentence><sentence id="1291">We didn't know what day of the week, what month we be...we just didn't any more uh uh mentally uh whether it was day or whether it was night or what. </sentence><sentence id="1292">It was dark in there with a little tiny <span class="dlf">window</span> where they pushed the stuff going and and a little <span class="spatial object">pot</span> to uh
