</sentence><sentence id="35">It was really was a good life, a good wholesome life. </sentence><sentence id="36">And uh we had a good social life and uh my brothers were...I'm the youngest of the boys

id="46">We were always the last one to get what we want, if we were lucky enough to get it. </sentence><sentence id="47">And by by the time I was eleven, twelve years old, I was thrown out of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">Well, there there was a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> in my uh <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, in <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span> (ph), but there were so many Jewish kids that they didn't have enough <span class="interior space">room</span> for all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we only could go to <span class="building">school</span> maybe two hours a week or three hours a week in shifts. </sentence><sentence id="50">And we had all this...I took stride. </sentence><sentence id="51">I just didn't...1 really didn't understand this whole thing, and nobody else really explained anything to us. </sentence><sentence id="52">They would try to keep it away from us...until uh 1938. </sentence><sentence id="53">The week before Kristallnacht when they start to arrest all the Jews of Polish background origin, they deported them. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh the children were in <span class="building">school</span> and the fathers were at their place of work and the mothers were in in the <span class="building">houses</span> cooking and things, and just were arrested, one after another, put to...not not given time uh to  Nobody knew where anybody was and the children came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">The place was padlocked. </sentence><sentence id="56">They sat outside, didn't know what was happening to them. </sentence><sentence id="57">Then they grabbed the children, put them on another <span class="spatial object">train</span> until they they worked it out, what was happening and everybody started running for the em...<span class="building">consulate</span>, the <span class="building">embassies</span>, because the <span class="building">embassies</span>...they couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="58">They were safe there. </sentence><sentence id="59">So they went to the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">They went to the <span class="building">American Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">They went to the <span class="building">Russian Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">They went to the Danish, Norwegian, <span class="country">Swiss</span>...anything that was near. </sentence><sentence id="63">So our job was to bring food to these people and take messages, because if the wife was in the <span class="building">Danish Embassy</span> and the husband was in the in the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>, we just took messages back and forth trying to seek the families out to tell them that their loved ones were alright. </sentence><sentence id="64">That went on for a couple of days, and uh the night...the 8th of November...I believe it was the 9th or the 8th...8th or 9th of November I believe...I never forgot...the uh the uh Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="65">That is when I really really was hit with the uh with the happenings there. </sentence><sentence id="66">They came to our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">They broke everything up and like that in every other <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">They were raping the young girls in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and and dragging men by their beards through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and burning down the <span class="building">temples</span> and and and and and threw...1 remember they threw all our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and <span class="spatial object">dishes</span> and everything out the <span class="dlf">window</span> and and and uh beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="69">They came in...the Hitler youth...with their daggers, blood and honor, and punks, bands of punks and they're beating everybody up, taking people to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, arresting people and it was just a terrible, terrible night. </sentence><sentence id="70">It started about three o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="71">That night they arrested my brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="72">My brother uh Bernie (ph), he had left. </sentence><sentence id="73">Of course, there was still <span class="building">home</span>...I was still <span class="building">home</span>, my three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="74">We were hiding in one of the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> but they dragged us out, beat up my mother and the next day it was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="75">The smoke was still coming out of the <span class="building">buildings</span> of the <span class="building">temples</span> and the <span class="building">schules</span> and <span class="building">houses</span> and there was still blood in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">Now I knew...now I knew...something terrible is happening. </sentence><sentence id="77">But I didn't know what to do about it. </sentence><sentence id="78">1 had my mama. </sentence><sentence id="79">I had my mother. </sentence><sentence id="80">She was always taking care of us. ( </sentence><sentence id="81">Sigh) Well, my brother Paul to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="82">My other brother went to <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">They were taken, and a few days later they came to our <span class="building">house</span> from a Jewish organization and they said we can save one child. </sentence><sentence id="84">Which one is going to live and which ones are going to die? ( </sentence><sentence id="85">Sigh) My mother had to make a choice and by the time the choice was made and everything, the other one was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="86">Was just left me and my three little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="87">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="88">A couple of months passed and my mother sent me out for a loaf of bread and I never came back. </sentence><sentence id="89">A <span class="spatial object">car</span> came screeching to a halt...are you a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="90">I was sixteen years old...fifteen, sixteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="91">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="92">I didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="93">These were mean looking men. </sentence><sentence id="94">They put me into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and I found myself in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">No explanation was given. </sentence><sentence id="96">None was asked. </sentence><sentence id="97">I remember the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, <span class="building">cell</span> number ten. </sentence><sentence id="98">My mother wondered what happened to me...send me out for a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="99">I was in <span class="building">jail</span> about...I would say about two months, three months...till May, approximately May. </sentence><sentence id="100">Suddenly they let me go free. </sentence><sentence id="101">I had to sign a paper that I was going to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> within forty-eight hours...they will let me go, and that I was treated well. </sentence><sentence id="102">Again I didn't know what I was signing. </sentence><sentence id="103">They told me to sign. </sentence><sentence id="104">I signed. </sentence><sentence id="105">And I went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">I remember to this day...my mother stay...stood at the <span class="dlf">door</span> of our apart...our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">She had ten marks...that was all we were allowed to take. </sentence><sentence id="108">Ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="109">She must have had this in cash laying around because all our money had been confiscated by the  state, and we had nothing left and she said to me, you have to leave <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">Don't even go into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">You have to leave <span class="building">home</span> right now. </sentence><sentence id="112">Here is ten marks. </sentence><sentence id="113">She says go to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114"><span class="country">Italy</span> was the only <span class="country">country</span> that had open <span class="dlf">borders</span> because they are friends with . </sentence><sentence id="115">Hitler was the leader. </sentence><sentence id="116">They were friends. </sentence><sentence id="117">They had no closed <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">And that  because war was eminent, and the women had to volunteer for the <span class="building">French Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">We said wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="120">We all went to the <span class="building">French Embassy</span>, and we all got that...the one day flag they call it. </sentence><sentence id="121">We got a visa to enter <span class="country">France</span> that was good for 24 hours only. </sentence><sentence id="122">Well, there was only <span class="spatial object">train</span> going to the <span class="dlf">French border</span> because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that. </sentence><sentence id="123">We had to get that <span class="spatial object">train</span> and they gave us a <span class="spatial object">train</span> ticket so we went for that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Now what that <span class="spatial object">train</span> looked like you will never know. </sentence><sentence id="125">They were hanging out of the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">They were laying on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span>...inside...outside. </sentence><sentence id="127">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="128">They...they...they held children out out the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">There was <span class="interior space">room</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="130">They were suffocating inside. </sentence><sentence id="131">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that is good for three hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="132">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> took off. </sentence><sentence id="133">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">They were hanging out <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">Outside...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails. </sentence><sentence id="136">People fell off, actually fell off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> while the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was moving so the <span class="spatial object">train</span> conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="137">By the time we got to the <span class="dlf">Italian/French border</span>, it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="138">The French had closed the <span class="dlf">border</span> and there's a little piece of <span class="region">land</span> called <span class="dlf">no man's land</span> and the Italians wouldn't let us back. </sentence><sentence id="139">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="140">So we laid on that little piece <span class="region">land</span>...there was a <span class="populated place">fishing village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">.St. </sentence><sentence id="142"><span class="populated place">Reno__</span>...it's right on the <span class="dlf">border</span>. . </sentence><sentence id="143">It's right on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, and these old fishermen with these old  The smugglers took all their...what they owned in the middle of the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and abandoned them. </sentence><sentence id="144">The baby started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="145">The Germans got them and hang them. </sentence><sentence id="146">They hang _ fromthe _ wife and baby next to her. </sentence><sentence id="147">They were found like that. </sentence><sentence id="148">I said anything you know about my brother Paul. </sentence><sentence id="149">He says yes. </sentence><sentence id="150">He went half crazy. </sentence><sentence id="151">So the word got out and he went into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">That's the last we heard of him. </sentence><sentence id="153">Because here and there, here and there, you found people that knew something about somebody. ( </sentence><sentence id="154">Sigh) Now we're stuck there on this piece of <span class="env feature">land</span> there, and we had to...well not much of a chance to tun to...to one side you had the French with their guns looking at us, and on the other side you had the Italians with guns looking at us, and to the front you had the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">There was nothing you could do with the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> and in the back of you, you had a <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">The highest <span class="env feature">mountain</span> we ever saw was the <span class="dlf">garbage dump</span> in our <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">I never saw a <span class="env feature">mountain</span> in my life before. </sentence><sentence id="158">How do you get out? </sentence><sentence id="159">A little boy hung on to me. </sentence><sentence id="160">He was twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="161">His name was Heinz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="162">He got lost, someplace along the the running, he got lost from his family. </sentence><sentence id="163">He says he wants to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="164">I said hang on, and then a few days passed by and the only help you got was from a few monks that used to come and used to give us a little milk and a little piece of bread, a few figs, a few uh uh olives and things. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was a pitiful sight. </sentence><sentence id="166">And yet I wasn't really worried. </sentence><sentence id="167">I just absorbed all this like matter of fact, and then said well, I'm going to do something about this. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I looked around, tried to make up my mind which way to go, and uh I said wouldn't the best approach be just go right up to the <span class="dlf">French border</span>, crawl through the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> there, and get inside. </sentence><sentence id="169">Now wouldn't that be just just a crazy thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="170">Said to Heinz, look...we can't take the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">We can't go back to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">We can't officially go to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">We can't go the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">We'll never...never make it. </sentence><sentence id="175">I have an idea. </sentence><sentence id="176">Let's do the crazy thing that nobody expects us to do. </sentence><sentence id="177">He says, what? </sentence><sentence id="178">I said let's go right through the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> into...let's go right into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">He said, you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="180">I said yes, that's why...that's what everybody thinks...I'm crazy. </sentence><sentence id="181">Let's do the crazy thing. </sentence><sentence id="182">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="183">I said we're going to die. </sentence><sentence id="184">We're going to starve to death here, and there must have been about a thousand, maybe fourteen hundred people lying on this <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">I don't know ever what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="186">I don't...never found out what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="187">We went through the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, and I said you just follow me. </sentence><sentence id="188">What happen will happen. </sentence><sentence id="189">What have we got to loose? </sentence><sentence id="190">And I wasn't worried really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="191">| was maybe too young to worry about things and too ignorant. ( </sentence><sentence id="192">Laughter) We did that. </sentence><sentence id="193">Coming out on the other side I was looking up and I looked into the barrel of a gun. </sentence><sentence id="194">There was a French guard there and border guards there. </sentence><sentence id="195">He looked down at me. </sentence><sentence id="196">I looked up at him, and Heinz stopped crawling and I stopped crawling, and he had the gun aimed at us, so I said to him in German...shoot me but let him live. </sentence><sentence id="197">He's only twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="198">So it was that somebody something in French. </sentence><sentence id="199">I could not speak it. </sentence><sentence id="200">He...he called something back in French, and he says...he spoke broken German...he said to me, see that <span class="spatial object">train</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="201">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="202">Get in it. </sentence><sentence id="203">It's going to go to <span class="populated place">Nice</span>, into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">uncivilized person. </sentence><sentence id="205">We went in. </sentence><sentence id="206"> <span class="spatial object">mobile</span> (ph), and let me assure you the gendarmes and the guard du mobile, they are not the gentlest of people. </sentence><sentence id="207">They really are nasty dogs. </sentence><sentence id="208">They grabbed us. </sentence><sentence id="209">They called us spies, spies there. </sentence><sentence id="210">I was a spy and they threw us in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Now in <span class="country">France</span> if you're caught about illegally, they...that's the law. </sentence><sentence id="212">You'll get one month in <span class="building">jail</span>, before they even talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="213">I learned to understand what <span class="building">jail</span> is in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214"><span class="building">Jail</span> is a dirty <span class="interior space">cell</span> with roaches and rats and and you get a drink of water a day and a piece of bread full of ants. </sentence><sentence id="215">In order to eat the bread full of...and you knock out the ants as best you can...you break off a piece of bread and throw it in the <span class="interior space">corner</span>, let the rats fight over it while they let you eat...quickly eat the other piece. </sentence><sentence id="216">That's is <span class="building">jail</span> in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">After one day, took me out and they put me into a open <span class="spatial object">car</span>, like they called that the commando, like with eight people could sit there, like a long open <span class="spatial object">van</span> or something...I don't know what you call it. </sentence><sentence id="218">Eight guard du <span class="spatial object">mobile</span>, eight of them...they put me in chains. </sentence><sentence id="219">My...my legs and my arm in chains, and it took eight guards du mobile...guard du mobile is the French police and gendarmes...to guard me, after they chased me down, after I was already down to nothing from lack of food and lack of sleep and and and I had no more tears left to cry. </sentence><sentence id="220">I don't know what happened to Heinz. </sentence><sentence id="221">And they took me out. </sentence><sentence id="222">Nobody told me where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="223">Nobody told me anything. </sentence><sentence id="224">We went to <span class="populated place">Entibe</span> (ph), a place called <span class="populated place">Entibe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225"><span class="dlf">Entibe</span> is outside <span class="populated place">Nice</span>, a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">They call it <span class="populated place">internment camp</span>, but don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="227">Don't you believe <span class="populated place">internment camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228"><span class="populated place">Resettlement camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">Don't you believe it. </sentence><sentence id="230">These are <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, in the sense of the word...<span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> with all their pitfalls, all their filth and all their dirt and and and and and and all their...all their nastiness and brutality. </sentence><sentence id="231">There was no place for us to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="232">We slept on <span class="interior space">floors</span> under the open <span class="env feature">sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">Was___ maybe two thousand people in there. </sentence><sentence id="234">They pulled up in front of the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, opened up the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, took off the chains, grabbed me and threw me into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I fell down on my face into into the <span class="env feature">dirt</span> and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="236">They did this. </sentence><sentence id="237">That's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="238">I was in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, oh must have been well maybe six weeks, maybe two months and they took us back on <span class="spatial object">transports</span> on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they put us into another <span class="populated place">camp</span> which was called 5 . </sentence><sentence id="239">That is <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="240"> me...you know, kept an eye on me. </sentence><sentence id="241">Chased people away. </sentence><sentence id="242">When the other <span class="populated place">camp</span> ; was all <span class="building">brick factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">They had the <span class="interior space">catacombs</span> and they would lock us into the <span class="interior space">catacombs</span> like little <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> where they used to dry the bricks, like <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">There was this straw on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">They would chase us in there by the hundreds and lock the <span class="dlf">door</span>, a big <span class="dlf">iron door</span>, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="246">And we were lucky enough...was total darkness in there...when they stayed they put a few little bulbs and they are flickering in there and that is what...there we were. </sentence><sentence id="247">That is what we did. </sentence><sentence id="248">Honest to God...that is how we laid on the <span class="env feature">straw</span> and and and and just uh tried to exist. </sentence><sentence id="249">After a couple of months of that kind of life...well, they took us out once a day for exercise. </sentence><sentence id="250">They let us walk around the <span
