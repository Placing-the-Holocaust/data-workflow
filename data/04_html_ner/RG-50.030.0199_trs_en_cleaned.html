<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: I was raised in a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">It's in <span class="region">southern Poland</span> it's named <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>, and this belonged to the minor <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">We called it in Polish <span class="populated place">Mourpoliska</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">And before the first world war, it belonged to <span class="populated place">Alsea</span> which was called <span class="region">Galicia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">In 1920. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents and your family before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, we were a very large family. </sentence><sentence id="28">We were nine children, five sisters and four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was the youngest from the nine. </sentence><sentence id="30">My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my mother...the whole family was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="31">He had a long grey beard and my mother was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="32">She wear a <span class="spatial object">Sheitel</span>, which means a wig. </sentence><sentence id="33">And everything was around Jewish tradition, Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="34">I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a <span class="building">school</span> for boys. </sentence><sentence id="35">Til 3 years I had my hair. </sentence><sentence id="36">By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side locks. </sentence><sentence id="37">And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small <span class="building">Yeshiva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">They called it <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> for the young boys. </sentence><sentence id="39">I also started <span class="building">public school</span>, regular <span class="building">public schools</span> for which was together with the Polish boys. </sentence><sentence id="40">And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> to a very famous Rabbi in the <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>, a larger <span class="populated place">town</span> and which my father was a disciple of this Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="41">He was a follower, so he send me to his <span class="building">Yeshiva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">And then when I came back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in my father's <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">And my father had a <span class="building">wholesale store</span> in which we sold everything. </sentence><sentence id="44">Now the <span class="building">stores</span> in the <span class="populated place">villages</span> used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their <span class="building">stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">So here you could call it a <span class="building">general store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">We had there everything what was needed for a <span class="building">household</span>, we sold it. </sentence><sentence id="47">And it was quite a prosperous business. </sentence><sentence id="48">Our <span class="populated place">town</span> mostly, they were very poor Jews. </sentence><sentence id="49">I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10 percent were rich Jews. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews. </sentence><sentence id="51">And this how we lived. </sentence><sentence id="52">It was a very close family. </sentence><sentence id="53">My sisters, when they were married, my father saw to it that they would remain in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">He gave them a dowry. </sentence><sentence id="55">He bought them a <span class="building">house</span>, and he established a business for them. </sentence><sentence id="56">What he used to do, he used to take a branch from our <span class="building">business</span> and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for this <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">And this we lived quite happily til the war. </sentence><sentence id="58">My oldest brother went to <span class="country">America</span> in 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="59">The Poles came and  they killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining independence. </sentence><sentence id="60">So what is a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to have a little pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="61">Not a big one, but at least nine people killed. </sentence><sentence id="62">So after this, my oldest brother left and he came to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">So he didn't know me because I was born a year later. </sentence><sentence id="64">In 1933, my second brother left. </sentence><sentence id="65">He became a Zionist which all family was always in. </sentence><sentence id="66">There were Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even my father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="67">And my brother left in 1933 as a Chalutz, as a pioneer in this time. </sentence><sentence id="68">So those brothers were out from our <span class="populated place">town</span>, but the rest were living in our <span class="populated place">town</span> til the war started. </sentence><sentence id="69">And it was a happy life. </sentence><sentence id="70">I was never satisfied with this life in this little <span class="interior space">stet</span>] because I looked for something else. </sentence><sentence id="71">I wanted to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">I wanted to study. </sentence><sentence id="73">I wanted to go to <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">My dream was to become a doctor, but I was too young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, "I want to take off this Hasidic clothing," which I always hated, "and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man." </sentence><sentence id="75">But it didn't come til a year before the war. </sentence><sentence id="76">I joined the Zionist organization which was the <span class="building">Hanoar Hatzioni</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that gave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak to her. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a chance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me that I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in the <span class="building">temple</span>, in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and to study from morning til night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What happened when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to <span class="country">Germany</span>, we felt it in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti- Semitism a little more openly. </sentence><sentence id="135">Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the marshall in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and he was quite good for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="136">And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of tihngs happened. </sentence><sentence id="137">It changed. </sentence><sentence id="138"><span class="building">Smidli</span> took it over and then special laws came out against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="139">The <span class="building">businesses</span> started to be bad for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="140">They opened <span class="building">cooperatives</span> and slogans were all over and they used to say in <span class="country">Poland</span>, [<span class="country">polish</span>] [<span class="country">polish</span>] means everybody to his own for his own. </sentence><sentence id="141">The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small businesses in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">So what they did. </sentence><sentence id="143">peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so usually used to buy them, but they brought them to the <span class="building">cooperatives</span> and they used to exchange them for merchandise they needed. </sentence><sentence id="144">So they cut out the Jew who bought the produce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="145">But we, our family didn't suffer because they were not enough advanced to have wholesale places to supply the <span class="building">storekeepers</span> in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">So even there were more <span class="building">storekeepers</span> in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, our business improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the peasants in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">So we didn't feel it. </sentence><sentence id="148">But my father always said that this is only for a time being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own <span class="building">wholesale stores</span> and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the manufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands. </sentence><sentence id="149">So we knew this is only...in a short time, our <span class="building">business</span> will go down also. </sentence><sentence id="150">And then the climate was so bad that everything what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">There  was a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of Pilsudski would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come to be that the slaughters should be forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="152">Also, they organized ,they established a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> on the system that it was in <span class="country">Germany</span> in this time because in <span class="country">Germany</span> even before the war, they had a few <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, which starting with <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">So they had in <span class="country">Poland</span>, a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Breizakotuska</span> . </sentence><sentence id="154">This was in the <span class="region">northern part</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists which were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business, they did something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="156">Instead to put them to <span class="building">jail</span> or instead they give them fine, they brought them over to this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, which was a very notorious <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">So all those things were prepared against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="158">Like for instance, there was the Prime Minister. </sentence><sentence id="159">His name was Slatkovski ?. </sentence><sentence id="160">He was a general, so he even was a very famous expression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of <span class="country">Poland</span>, be thrown out of <span class="country">Poland</span>, beaten up in <span class="country">Poland</span>, so he said to beat up Jews no, but to destroy them economically he said ofshun. </sentence><sentence id="161">In Polish ofshun means by all means. </sentence><sentence id="162">So this was a very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="163">Now, for instance, the...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="196">I'm gonna have to break in if I may. </sentence><sentence id="197">We need...for this interview, I want to talk about you. </sentence><sentence id="198">So let's focus on what happened to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="204">Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I decided that I have to leave <span class="country">Poland</span>, that this <span class="country">Poland</span> was not for me, so I had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="205">Now to leave <span class="country">Poland</span> wasn't so easy because where would you go to? </sentence><sentence id="206">I wanted to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> because I became a Zionist and this was my dream. </sentence><sentence id="207">But to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> wasn't so easy. </sentence><sentence id="208">I was little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English government and only a few got and a few were lucky in that. </sentence><sentence id="209">And so I decided to go illegal to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be smuggled to <span class="country">Romania</span>, and <span class="country">Romania</span> to take a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> illegal to enter <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">So we had to pay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="212">I decided with a friend of mine, he was a very close friend. </sentence><sentence id="213">Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day when the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="214">So his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she had to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="215">He was short 200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to be and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in September, the Ist of September. </sentence><sentence id="217">And this dream fell through. </sentence><sentence id="218">Also I wanted to come to <span class="country">America</span> because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here. </sentence><sentence id="219">My father was the only one who remained <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">So I wrote them letters and I begged them to send me papers. </sentence><sentence id="221">But none of them sent me papers. </sentence><sentence id="222">Only what they had to do is to invest 25 cents to go to another <span class="country">Republic</span> and send me affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="223">But they didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="224">And when they didn't do it, so <span class="country">America</span> was out. </sentence><sentence id="225"><span class="country">Palestine</span> was out. </sentence><sentence id="226">So I had to stay there til the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="227">Now, lst of September the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="228">And it was a very bad feeling because we  knew that this something terrible will happen. </sentence><sentence id="229">Everybody there were rumors that the Polish army is strong. </sentence><sentence id="230">We have a strong <span class="dlf">calvary</span>, and they mobilized people, the older people. </sentence><sentence id="231">Now the Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there, because they mobilized old people. </sentence><sentence id="232">People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="233">The young people they didn't mobilize. </sentence><sentence id="234">And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="235">I wanted to be part of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">I lived in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">So I went and I volunteered to the army soon as the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="238">They didn't accept me because they said they don't have enough uniforms for the regular army. </sentence><sentence id="239">How would they take me? </sentence><sentence id="240">So my parents naturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="241">The feeling was that something terrible will happen and we awaited it. </sentence><sentence id="242">Now the Ist of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3 days later. </sentence><sentence id="243">Thousands of refugee came through our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">And most refugee who fled from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we didn't have a <span class="dlf">railroad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">And there was a short cut from <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> to cut through to the <span class="region">east</span>, and usually when there was a <span class="spatial object">railroad</span> the Germans used to bomb the <span class="spatial object">railroad</span> and to shoot, so this way because there were <span class="dlf">fields</span> so they used to go through this <span class="dlf">route</span>, thousands and thousands, every day more and more. </sentence><sentence id="246">And then later you could see the army broken up, broken units, and they came through our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">And Saturday, the 9th of September, the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="248">And as we were never a lucky <span class="populated place">town</span>, like we had a pogrom; we had other things always happen in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">So Saturday morning the <span class="populated place">town</span> was clear. </sentence><sentence id="250">There were no Polish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and take the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and they said they're going to make a <span class="dlf">line</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock, and there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and there were about 150 Jewish civilians. </sentence><sentence id="253">Why Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="254">They didn't kill when there was a battle picking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="255">They didn't know where to hide. </sentence><sentence id="256">They mostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away. </sentence><sentence id="257">They were not so much afraid so they were caught in the middle in a strange <span class="populated place">town</span> and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="258">And the atrocities started right away. </sentence><sentence id="259">They took us out in a open place, and they burned half of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">And we were in the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by Polish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">And they burned, they purposely started to burn the <span class="populated place">town</span>, the <span class="building">houses</span> around where we were located. </sentence><sentence id="262">And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time. </sentence><sentence id="263">But it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="264">They will let us go." </sentence><sentence id="265">And they kept us for a whole night in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266">The next day we came <span class="building">home</span>, and all the <span class="building">houses</span> were plundered, the <span class="building">houses</span> which were not burned were plundered. </sentence><sentence id="267">The Germans stayed in there a half day. </sentence><sentence id="268">They went in and took out everything they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="269">And we started to live under German occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Can you slow down just a moment. </sentence><sentence id="338">Tell us what it was like for you under these conditions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="341">What did it feel like you standing there watching all this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: When I was watching where we were in this place, surrounded and when they started to burn the <span class="building">houses</span> around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I looked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him. </sentence><sentence id="343">Being in a uniform, having a  rifle in my hand, and he should be the victim. </sentence><sentence id="344">And I was thinking, "Would I let him die, to be burned alive?" </sentence><sentence id="345">Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself what I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they occupy a <span class="populated place">town</span> and take civilian people and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="346">Because we were sure that they would keep their promise and they would burn us. </sentence><sentence id="347">So then later, the next day they started to take us to work. </sentence><sentence id="348">And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work. </sentence><sentence id="349">The whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from <span class="spatial object">cannons</span> and we used to load it on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to take away. </sentence><sentence id="350">Also, we had maybe a hundred dead horses because it happened that this unit which came to our <span class="populated place">town</span> this day, this was a cavalry unit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed. </sentence><sentence id="351">And the horses were laying dead, and this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up. </sentence><sentence id="352">Now Jews were not used to such kind of work, bury horses. </sentence><sentence id="353">They were not strong enough for this. </sentence><sentence id="354">So we had to dig <span class="dlf">holes</span> and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="355">And so there were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he said to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other. </sentence><sentence id="356">And he said to go in in the <span class="dlf">hole</span> with the horse and we had to burn him too alive. </sentence><sentence id="357">And we started to cover and with the <span class="env feature">dirt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">Then in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and cried. </sentence><sentence id="359">Finally, he was almost buried completely. </sentence><sentence id="360">He said, "Alright, you can dig him out." </sentence><sentence id="361">In those [days] they started to harass the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="362">They used to take old Jews with long beards and they used to harness them to <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, and they used to sit on the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and they used to pull them. </sentence><sentence id="363">Just to show and make pictures and make a film. </sentence><sentence id="364">Everything to insult. </sentence><sentence id="365">In the beginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us. </sentence><sentence id="366">But everyday something else happened. </sentence><sentence id="367">And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there were more severe insults. </sentence><sentence id="368">So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to cope with the new one. </sentence><sentence id="369">And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out from their <span class="building">houses</span> between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till 6. </sentence><sentence id="370">So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for the family. </sentence><sentence id="371">Naturally, nobody did business anymore. </sentence><sentence id="372">They confiscated the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="373">They took away everything. </sentence><sentence id="374">And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running, running, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="375">And then later he was in a hurry to go <span class="building">home</span>, not to be caught in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="376">So those were the harassments. </sentence><sentence id="377">Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">We had to walk on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">The first day it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="380">What you mean I cannot walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>? </sentence><sentence id="381">But later we got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="382">We got used to it, so we walked on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and if somebody walked on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> in the beginning they didn't shoot us, but they arrested them. </sentence><sentence id="383">Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a German on the <span class="dlf">street</span> had to take off his hat. </sentence><sentence id="384">He had to greet him. </sentence><sentence id="385">Now, so they were cases like in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he took off his hat. </sentence><sentence id="386">So he went to him. </sentence><sentence id="387">He started to beat him up. </sentence><sentence id="388">And he beat him up and he said, "Why do you beat me?" </sentence><sentence id="389">He says, "Well, because why you taking off the hat. </sentence><sentence id="390">Why you greeting me? </sentence><sentence id="391">What am I? </sentence><sentence id="392">Your friend? </sentence><sentence id="393">You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German. </sentence><sentence id="394">Why am I your friend. </sentence><sentence id="395">Why you greeting me?" </sentence><sentence id="396">So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't take off the hat. </sentence><sentence id="397">So he went and he beat him up. </sentence><sentence id="398">And he said, "How long do we have to teach you when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow  because you are subhuman and..... So everything what they did, it was only to make life miserable. </sentence><sentence id="399">And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same people and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="400">And then the Poles were standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were very[helpful?] </sentence><sentence id="401">and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="402">They couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="403">One word they learned very fast. </sentence><sentence id="404">Jude. </sentence><sentence id="405">Jude. </sentence><sentence id="406">So they went with the Germans and they used to show the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="407">Jude. </sentence><sentence id="408">Jude. </sentence><sentence id="409">Jude. </sentence><sentence id="410">That there lives a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="411">So the Germans went in and took out everybody and dragged them to work. </sentence><sentence id="412">Now the work was done and they didn't pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="413">The people were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="414">They couldn't make a few zlotys in their profession or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="415">They had to go from morning til night to work. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the worst time was in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="417">In the winter we had to clear the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">From far away, kilometers away, for the Germans that their <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> should be able to travel. </sentence><sentence id="419">So we had to stay in the snow from morning til night. </sentence><sentence id="420">Even when the snow was falling down, we still had to clean. </sentence><sentence id="421">So we sometimes asked, "What's the use to clean up? </sentence><sentence id="422">In 5 minutes they will be covered with <span class="env feature">snow</span> again?" </sentence><sentence id="423">But nevertheless, we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="424">And I was with the Germans about a month. </sentence><sentence id="425">Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his friends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans took away everything we had from our <span class="building">warehouses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">They cleared out everything. </sentence><sentence id="427">They didn't leave anything. </sentence><sentence id="428">And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, "Someday, I will pay you back for it." </sentence><sentence id="429">And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="430">I was at this time 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="431">I was a boy from the <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> from a <span class="building">Rabbinical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="432">Before the war, I wore the long <span class="spatial object">peijes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">And he told them that I belonged before the war to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I also said that I will go and to do some sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="434">This what he told the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="435">Now, they didn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="436">I find out about it and I run away to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="437">To the <span class="region">Russia zone</span> because <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided. </sentence><sentence id="438">The <span class="region">western part</span> was taken over by the Germans, and the <span class="region">eastern part</span> was taken over by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="439">So I went over to the <span class="region">Russian zone</span> and I went to <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> [<span class="populated place">Lwow</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="440">And I was very happy in <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> because there I joined a <span class="building">gymnasium</span> which I always dreamed about it. </sentence><sentence id="441">And I also joined a <span class="building">Jewish theatrical group</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">There was a <span class="building">Jewish theatre</span> and I always I said, "If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor." </sentence><sentence id="443">I always had it in my blood. </sentence><sentence id="444">And even in <span class="building">home</span> before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim, every year our <span class="building">school</span> made the play. </sentence><sentence id="445">And I always had the lead in this play and I used to sing by a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="446">I had a voice soprano, so the <span class="spatial object">cantor</span> liked me and I used to sing solos. </sentence><sentence id="447">So I came to <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> and my dream was fulfilled. </sentence><sentence id="448">I went to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span> and I joined a <span class="building">theater</span> so I could play...be a part of it. </sentence><sentence id="449">So I said, "Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I will meanwhile do what I want to do." </sentence><sentence id="450">Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="451">I find out that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her mother because her father and brother and sister were on the <span class="region">Russian side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">So I find out about it. </sentence><sentence id="453">I decided to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="454">And I came back to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="455">And I will never forget, this was already in January. </sentence><sentence id="456">We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and we went through the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we were caught. </sentence><sentence id="457">Those are long stories. </sentence><sentence id="458">I don't want to dwell on how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to <span class="building">jail</span> to <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>,  back to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="459">We knew once we are in the <span class="building">jail</span>, so after from the <span class="building">jail</span>, they send us to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with blankets. </sentence><sentence id="461">We took away their rifles, and we went back to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and this time we managed to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Who is... Slow down. </sentence><sentence id="583">We have plenty of time. </sentence><sentence id="584">Who is we? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="588">A: Well, there was one man. </sentence><sentence id="589">Before the war, he was a <span class="building">horse dealer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">And he lived in the <span class="region">section</span> where the <span class="dlf">border</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="591">The <span class="populated place">town</span>'s name was <span class="populated place">Jarloslaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="592">It was known that every week he takes a group of people who want to go to back. </sentence><sentence id="593">And when we came back he took a group of people who want to run away from the <span class="region">German side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="594">So he was like a smuggler. </sentence><sentence id="595">He was a Jewish man. </sentence><sentence id="596">And he took at this time 15 boys from our <span class="populated place">town</span> who wanted to go back. </sentence><sentence id="597">Because in the beginning they couldn't make a living in <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="599">There were thousands and thousands of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="600">They didn't have where to live, where to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="601">So here somebody told us that the Jews live in their <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="602">It's bad under the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="603">They have to work. </sentence><sentence id="604">They have to do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="605">But the atrocities didn't start right in the beginning, so they figured they will come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="606">I came <span class="building">home</span> because on account of this girl. </sentence><sentence id="607">Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too. </sentence><sentence id="608">And I will never forget the day that I came <span class="building">home</span>, my father was sitting in our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> studying some Talmud, and I came in and he saw me and I said, "I'm back." </sentence><sentence id="609">And he didn't lift his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="610">While looking still in the book, he said, "As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in your life that you came back." </sentence><sentence id="611">Those were his words when he saw me when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="612">And naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that somebody would say, "The police." </sentence><sentence id="613">because I remembered that they wanted me. </sentence><sentence id="614">But this was already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in our <span class="populated place">town</span> going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little <span class="building">store</span>, but it was little in this time. </sentence><sentence id="615">But he didn't come in in the <span class="building">store</span>, because he was a Jew with a long beard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull. </sentence><sentence id="616">So my sisters were in the <span class="building">store</span> and I started to travel to different <span class="populated place">towns</span>, and brought in merchandise, mostly <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="617">And this how we started to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I was the young in the family, so I had to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters. </sentence><sentence id="619">Their husbands were not capable to do it. </sentence><sentence id="620">They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was young. </sentence><sentence id="621">They didn't speak so good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="622">So I used to travel every day someplace else and to bring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money. </sentence><sentence id="623">And we worked like this til about spring of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="624">Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered. </sentence><sentence id="625">And then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, and they took us in a big <span class="building">building</span> and they made like a selection. </sentence><sentence id="626">From the people who were registered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the places where <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> were waiting. </sentence><sentence id="627">And they send us to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="628">This was the first time they made this registration. </sentence><sentence id="629">And the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> was in a <span class="populated place">town</span>...in a <span class="populated place">village</span> called <span class="populated place">Leipvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="630">This was near a <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Novisanz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">This was near the <span class="dlf">southern border</span> this was in the <span class="env feature">Carpathian mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">Our work was that we had to break <span class="env feature">rocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">It was like a <span class="dlf">quarry</span> where we had to break rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to transport them to a place on hand <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, on <span class="spatial object">wheel barrels</span>, and the next day we took the  same rocks and we brought them back to the first place. </sentence><sentence id="634">And this was our work. </sentence><sentence id="635">It was very hard work. </sentence><sentence id="636">And they gave us very little food. </sentence><sentence id="637">But it wasn't so bad because in this time, this was in 1940, our people in our <span class="populated place">town</span> still lived in their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="638">They still had what to eat. </sentence><sentence id="639">And the <span class="building">post office</span> could send...we could send packages. </sentence><sentence id="640">So the <span class="populated place">community</span> from our <span class="populated place">town</span> used to send every week a package to every prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="641">And they send it to the community of <span class="populated place">Novasanz</span>, of this <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="642">And this Jewish community brought it us to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">So we had enough. </sentence><sentence id="644">After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away. </sentence><sentence id="645">And all of us run away. </sentence><sentence id="646">And the Germans didn't even look for us even run away. </sentence><sentence id="647">What did they do? </sentence><sentence id="648">When everybody run away, they had from different <span class="populated place">towns</span>, also young people, so they went to other <span class="populated place">town</span> and brought in other <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">So they didn't bother looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="650">So I came back from this <span class="populated place">camp</span> and I started to work by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="651">So they took me and we started to build <span class="building">garages</span> for the Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="652">And they accepted me. </sentence><sentence id="653">They also made us register, they looked us over who is young and strong, so because of my work. </sentence><sentence id="654">So everyday I went to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="655">They didn't pay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work different work like cleaning the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, cleaning the <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="656">Because I had to go work anyways. </sentence><sentence id="657">At least I went in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="658">I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="659">And we worked there. </sentence><sentence id="660">And once being with those Germans or working in the <span class="building">garages</span>, so I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="661">I used to bring to the Germans a few <span class="spatial object">eggs</span>, and we exchanged this. </sentence><sentence id="662">And it was there where I worked. </sentence><sentence id="663">And sisters were in the <span class="building">store</span>, and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce. </sentence><sentence id="664">It was not like before the war, but we thought it is bad, but somehow we will survive. </sentence><sentence id="665">They didn't lull at this time. </sentence><sentence id="666">But Jews for every little things were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="667">They were harassed. </sentence><sentence id="668">And they caught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="669">After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out. </sentence><sentence id="670">And everything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police. </sentence><sentence id="671">And we still lived in our <span class="building">houses</span>, so it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="672">But we knew that we are under German occupation, and also we heard stories from other <span class="populated place">towns</span> about atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="673">There was a <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Mielec</span>, for instance, not far from my <span class="populated place">town</span>, so when the Germans came in, they took about 200 Jews and they put them in in the <span class="building">shul</span>, in the <span class="building">temple</span>, and also in the <span class="interior space">public bath</span> and they closed the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and they burned the people with the <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="760">Q: Do you see that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="762">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="763">No. </sentence><sentence id="764">No. </sentence><sentence id="765">This I didn't see, but this was in the next <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="766">So we heard about atrocities from different <span class="populated place">towns</span>, but they asked...it was just arresting contribution...we had to pay money, but nothing terrible happened. </sentence><sentence id="767">Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a very notorious <span class="populated place">camp</span> near us named <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span>, and <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span> was an <span class="populated place">SS camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="768">Now <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span> was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the <span class="spatial object">V-1</span>, <span class="spatial object">V-2</span>, <span class="spatial object">rockets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this place because there were a lot of <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="770">In <span class="country">Poland</span>, there was a <span class="region">section</span>, it was called <span class="populated place">Pushun Sandomerska</span> . </sentence><sentence id="771">It means the <span class="env feature">wilderness</span> of <span class="populated place">Sandomierz</span>, the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="772">Before the 18th century practically, nobody could go through it. </sentence><sentence id="773">It was old, virgin <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="774">Later, people started to make <span class="populated place">villages</span>, <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">In this section of <span class="populated place">Pruszkow Sandomerzko</span>, they made the first experiments. </sentence><sentence id="776">They brought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time. </sentence><sentence id="777">Later, they killed the  people. </sentence><sentence id="778">They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about those experiments. </sentence><sentence id="779">I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a boom, a noise, but you didn't see a <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="780">You didn't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="781">You could hear it. </sentence><sentence id="782">It sound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="783">You could see a ball of fire and it disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="784">And this happened a few times a days, so this were the experiments that they used to shoot the <span class="spatial object">rockets</span>, but they exploded. </sentence><sentence id="785">Then later when the <span class="spatial object">rockets</span> exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="786">Now the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, <span class="spatial object">jars</span>, cups, everything they used to make from this. </sentence><sentence id="787">So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they used to send out special police to go and collect those items. </sentence><sentence id="788">And this came from <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="789">So in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="790">Again, there came a commission, and they took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people, they beat up everybody. </sentence><sentence id="791">And I remember I was beaten up terrible. </sentence><sentence id="792">I was standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, then somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back and I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="793">So the man who was in charge, his name was Schmidt. </sentence><sentence id="794">He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS. </sentence><sentence id="795">And he saw me on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose. </sentence><sentence id="796">So he came out and he said, "Hey, what happened to you?" </sentence><sentence id="797">Like not...he joked around. </sentence><sentence id="798">So he took out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood. </sentence><sentence id="799">So I wiped the blood. </sentence><sentence id="800">He said, "Now, clean my boots." </sentence><sentence id="801">So with my blood, I had to take and I had to wipe his boots with the blood." </sentence><sentence id="802">So those were the things that they were terrible in this time, but looking back those were things that you could survive. </sentence><sentence id="803">They were terrible, but it was not extermination. </sentence><sentence id="804">It was not killing off everybody. </sentence><sentence id="805">But in this time, those were the bad things. </sentence><sentence id="806">So I was taken to <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="807">They were so vicious that when they took us on open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they took in this maybe 100 from our <span class="populated place">town</span> in the open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, when we traveled, they took us by the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="808">The driver purposefully, in <span class="country">Poland</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, on both sides, there were <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="809">Now <span class="env feature">trees</span> were not high so he purposely drove the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> under the <span class="env feature">trees</span> where the <span class="env feature">branches</span> were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were hurt. </sentence><sentence id="810">It cut open their heads and all that because the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> went in the <span class="dlf">branches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="811">I was in <span class="populated place">Pruszkow</span> about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="812">During the time, every night was there a ritual. </sentence><sentence id="813">When there was the appell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged. </sentence><sentence id="814">We all had to watch by the <span class="spatial object">appell</span> how the man was hanged. </sentence><sentence id="815">And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the hangman. </sentence><sentence id="816">Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details, so there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew. </sentence><sentence id="817">So he took a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him. </sentence><sentence id="818">And also this Schmidt had a habit, when we walked to work we cut <span class="env feature">trees</span> because they wanted to make the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a little larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our <span class="spatial object">column</span>. </sentence><sentence id="819">Not aiming. </sentence><sentence id="820">So once I was hit in my right arm. </sentence><sentence id="821">And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no damage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up <span class="dlf">telephone poles</span> through the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="822">And one time when I lifted a <span class="dlf">telephone pole</span>, I dislocated a disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out. </sentence><sentence id="823">And then I knew that if 1 would be there and they would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man with a dislocated disc"? </sentence><sentence id="824">And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back <span class="building">home</span>.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men. </sentence><sentence id="898">I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="899">It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">So it was hard, but with the help with others, they covered me. </sentence><sentence id="901">You know, in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> the comradeship, the friendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend. </sentence><sentence id="902">Even we were strangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help their other friend. </sentence><sentence id="903">So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me. </sentence><sentence id="904">I used to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight. </sentence><sentence id="905">And I knew that I would not be able to hide this a long time. </sentence><sentence id="906">So there was a man who was in charge of the <span class="dlf">Jewish columns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="907">It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="908">And I told him this. </sentence><sentence id="909">His name was Kleinhandler from <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="910">And he was the head, he was like a middle man between the workers of <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> in this <span class="populated place">Pruszkow camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="911">So through him, he recommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape. </sentence><sentence id="912">He opened a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> when I went to work...a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> went to a <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Bembitza</span>.. And he told me to go on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and they took me away. </sentence><sentence id="913">Because the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was a <span class="spatial object">SS truck</span>, but he had to pick out so many workers to go to this <span class="populated place">town</span> so he picked me out. </sentence><sentence id="914">He knew that I have his name, I remember even was Immergluck . </sentence><sentence id="915">And he was not very much liked, because he did things that he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers. </sentence><sentence id="916">But to me, he was good because this other friend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they took me to work supposedly to the <span class="building">Bembitza</span> to bring some merchandise or to bring some supplies. </sentence><sentence id="917">So I went to <span class="populated place">Bembitza</span>, the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="918">And that's it. </sentence><sentence id="919">They didn't look for me. </sentence><sentence id="920">I came <span class="building">home</span> and I started to wear a brace. </sentence><sentence id="921">And then later after a few weeks, it healed. </sentence><sentence id="922">I had problems later, but I could walk out. </sentence><sentence id="923">I came back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="924">The situation started to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation is worse. </sentence><sentence id="925">Then later we received, we got in our <span class="populated place">town</span> a <span class="building">Land Kommissar</span> which is the head of the <span class="region">county</span>, because our <span class="populated place">town</span> was the <span class="populated place">county seat</span>, and there came a Land commissar, and his name was Farting. </sentence><sentence id="926">And he was the biggest sadist ever lived. </sentence><sentence id="927">And he was a German, but he also was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="928">And this was very bad, because he could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not healthy for us. </sentence><sentence id="929">So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar. </sentence><sentence id="930">Before he used to be in the <span class="building">Gestapo</span> in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="931">So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad things from both <span class="country">nations</span>, the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles, and he combined it in one person. </sentence><sentence id="932">He looked like a caricature. </sentence><sentence id="933">He was short, very fat, with a big belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>, small little eyes like a pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it came from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart. </sentence><sentence id="934">And he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious. </sentence><sentence id="935">So when he came he organized a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">And our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was organized before large <span class="populated place">towns</span> had <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because we already had a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in June 1941, which was very early. </sentence><sentence id="937">And he pushed into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000. </sentence><sentence id="938">And it was very cramped. </sentence><sentence id="939">And we  1 lived in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="940">And then we had an old man who was the President of the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>, which was a Doctor Unterman. </sentence><sentence id="941">And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered. </sentence><sentence id="942">If the Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have been the first saint. </sentence><sentence id="943">Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his life for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="944">Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="945">He was a assimilated Jew. </sentence><sentence id="946">He never bothered with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="947">He never belonged to a <span class="building">temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="948">He never even stepped in a <span class="building">Jewish temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="949">Only had his friends with the Polish people because he was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was one of the most important people in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">But with Jews he never had anything to do. </sentence><sentence id="951">He had Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all. </sentence><sentence id="952">When the war started he saw that he can speak to the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard. </sentence><sentence id="953">He was clean shaven. </sentence><sentence id="954">He was a captain in the Austrian army. </sentence><sentence id="955">He studied medicine in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them. </sentence><sentence id="956">Now, again, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him they will think twice. </sentence><sentence id="957">So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, "What I have nothing to do with Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="958">But later, we convinced him and he said he will become president if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him. </sentence><sentence id="959">And he picked out 12 younger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war. </sentence><sentence id="960">Honest people. </sentence><sentence id="961">Fine people. </sentence><sentence id="962">And he said, "If they will be with me in the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>, then I will be come the <span class="building">Hauptman</span>. </sentence><sentence id="963">And they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="964">As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he picked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12. </sentence><sentence id="965">And he ran this <span class="building">Judenrot</span> that I don't think so that any <span class="building">Judenrot</span> was run like this. </sentence><sentence id="966">He was so honest. </sentence><sentence id="967">I don't know if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples. </sentence><sentence id="968">Once they brought in, they gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap. </sentence><sentence id="969">And the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> divided the soap. </sentence><sentence id="970">And then about 5 kilo soap was left. </sentence><sentence id="971">It was more than they...so the Judenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give what's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">And one was for Dr.Unterman. </sentence><sentence id="973">And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, "This is for you." </sentence><sentence id="974">He said, "What is it?" </sentence><sentence id="975">He said, "Well, this is the soap." </sentence><sentence id="976">He says, "But I already got soap, what I suppose to get." " </sentence><sentence id="977">Well, this was left." </sentence><sentence id="978">And they explained it. </sentence><sentence id="979">And he said, "It was left and how much?" </sentence><sentence id="980">And they said, "We made 13 packages." </sentence><sentence id="981">He said, "I want to see the 13 packages." </sentence><sentence id="982">So they brought back what everybody took for himself. </sentence><sentence id="983">He opened it and he said, "Give me a list of 13 poorest Jews in our <span class="populated place">town</span>." </sentence><sentence id="984">So they picked out 13 poor Jews. " </sentence><sentence id="985">I want everybody should get a package. </sentence><sentence id="986">Not you. </sentence><sentence id="987">Not I." And he divided...this kind of man way he was. </sentence><sentence id="988">Like to the Germans he spoke to them like to equals. </sentence><sentence id="989">Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take over Unterman's <span class="building">house</span> because he built this <span class="building">house</span> a year before the war. </sentence><sentence id="990">And because he was a physician he was well off. </sentence><sentence id="991">And he built a beautiful <span class="building">house</span>, and this was the only <span class="building">house</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span> that had electricity. </sentence><sentence id="992">He had his own <span class="spatial object">generator</span>. </sentence><sentence id="993">The only one in <span class="populated place">town</span> that he had indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="994">He made it a beautiful <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="995">So naturally, Farding wanted this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="996">So he asked him, "I want to move in. </sentence><sentence id="997">Why don't you move in into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="998">So he told him, "In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> I will move in til the last Jew will have a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over his head. </sentence><sentence id="999">So long as the last  2 Jew doesn't have a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over his head, I will not move in." </sentence><sentence id="1000">Then later this Farding said, "The Judenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1001">He said, "Renovate? </sentence><sentence id="1002">I just built it. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And besides if 1 could live in it, you can live in it. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And then why should you renovate. </sentence><sentence id="1005">After the war will end, I will come back to my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1006">You will go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1007">Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> about 2 weeks, he took the whole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in <span class="building">jail</span> in <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> about a week or 2 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1008">They they were sent to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and from <span class="populated place">Rzeszowize</span> they were sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1009">In <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, there were orders was right in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1010">This was in the fall of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1011">In this time, you hardly knew that <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> exists. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And then they were sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the families, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Other one your husband died on heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Your husband died while he was running away. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And then it was a letter that the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband had heart trouble for 4 years. </sentence><sentence id="1016">Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1017">But they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound, everybody received a bill for the cremation. </sentence><sentence id="1018">They said people were cremated and the cremation cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money. </sentence><sentence id="1019">So every widow had to pay money for the cremation. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Now when the <span class="building">Judenrot</span> was liquidated, naturally, <span class="populated place">Fardring</span> organized a new <span class="building">Judenrot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1021">But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking of the Germans than Dr. Unterman. </sentence><sentence id="1023">That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and wouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor. </sentence><sentence id="1024">He probably would say I want the whole 13 packages. </sentence><sentence id="1025">This was a different. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And then it was life started to be more and more terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr.Unterman. </sentence><sentence id="1028">When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he organized an <span class="building">ambulatorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the <span class="building">ambulatorium</span>, and this was in my sister's <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and everybody who was sick who couldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And then later the Judenrat had to pay for medicine what they received. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Because he liked me, so he took me in the <span class="building">ambulatorium</span> I should be his assistant. </sentence><sentence id="1032">As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1033">So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds, how to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I worked with him every day and he showed me all these things. </sentence><sentence id="1035">This gave me opportunity when we were later in our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which we come to it, and we were in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> I became the doctor, the so-called doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1036">We had to do some medically, I always had that little <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> with all kind of instruments which I inherited after he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And I had this and I used to treat the people as much as I could, as much as he taught me. </sentence><sentence id="1038">So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and the Judenrat got killed. </sentence><sentence id="1039">He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife with the son escaped to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal papers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their language was only Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And during the uprising, not the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> uprising, but the general uprising in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1041">She survived and came to <span class="country">America</span>, and after the war and since then she died. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So men like this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Actually,  3 the Poles begged him to escape from <span class="building">jail</span> in <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>, and they wanted to take him and hide him and do anything for him. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And he said, "I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the Jews, because nobody will stick up for them." </sentence><sentence id="1045">And he thought that he would be able to speak up, and then later they got rid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Now once he was killed yes, also under his administration, because you asked me I should tell about me. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Because I before the war, I 01:55 worked in my father's <span class="building">store</span> and I used to go to different <span class="populated place">towns</span> buying all kind of merchandise for our <span class="building">store</span>, I knew the suppliers. </sentence><sentence id="1048">I knew the ways how to buy and bring in the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And also when I left our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we had to wear the arm band, a white arm band with a blue star of David. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Every time I left the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the first thing I took off my arm band. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And I traveled, nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never, never stopped for questioning that I'm a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I look so Polish, more than the Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="1053">So I never was suspected, so it was easy for me to go because and then later to bring in merchandise as a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1054">So Unterman picked me out and I was the one who used to go to different <span class="populated place">towns</span> and to bring in merchandise for the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Now, we later organized a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> for the people to come in to have a warm meal once a day. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Now when we had to buy those things we didn't receive as for the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on card, but we had to buy like potatoes, flour and other things. </sentence><sentence id="1057">So I used to go out to the peasants and used to buy it and bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And I did it for the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Now, also the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> received flour for baking bread, and each family received so much. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Sometimes two 01:57: loaves a week, sometimes 1 loaf a week. </sentence><sentence id="1061">This had to brought in. </sentence><sentence id="1062">So I used to go to the <span class="building">flour mills</span> and bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="1063">This was officially I brought it in. </sentence><sentence id="1064">We used to get sugar. </sentence><sentence id="1065">We used to get marmalade. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We used to get other things...supplies what the Germans get. </sentence><sentence id="1067">And this we used to get in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So I went twice a week, once a week, with <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and I brought this in and this was my job. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Instead to go and work on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and clean the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, so this was my job that Unterman assigned me to. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And for me, it was very good because when I went to buy all those things, I always brought something on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Paid extra money, and together with this merchandise, I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to sell something like this. </sentence><sentence id="1072">This went on til he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1073">When the new old man [Aeltester] . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1256">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1257">This is a good place to stop and break and change tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1260"> End of Tape #1  4 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1262">Q: You were telling us about you bringing in the supplies in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1264">A: So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Orders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be caught with a piece of fur in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So naturally most of the Jews gave the Germans the furs. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I remember there came a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1272">Q: Gave them what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1274">A: <span class="env feature">Fur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1275"><span class="env feature">Fur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1276"><span class="env feature">Fur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And then they had collars and fur, they gave them. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And it was not a rich <span class="populated place">town</span>, so you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old] or so. </sentence><sentence id="1279">It was all falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="1280">But they brought it over. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Everybody was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Some younger woman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style. </sentence><sentence id="1283">So some didn't give the Persian Lamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1284">I remember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the way they never gave it back to us. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And then there were other contributions. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Once this Farding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Ten kilo of gold in our <span class="populated place">town</span>...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how. </sentence><sentence id="1288">But this new president from the <span class="building">Judenrot</span>, his name was Pashek Rappaport. </sentence><sentence id="1289">He was very energetic. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And people were sometimes afraid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1291">So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it to <span class="populated place">Farding</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, "You know, you saved 20 Jewish lives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold." </sentence><sentence id="1293">I remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but 10 kilo is a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1294">So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my father came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to give this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in this time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a cigarette box from gold. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So he said, "I'm going to give it. </sentence><sentence id="1296">You see when I was engaged with your mother," he told me, "I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved it through the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it." </sentence><sentence id="1298">And he gave it. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so many lives. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished, the other came up. </sentence><sentence id="1301">The other came up. </sentence><sentence id="1302">We lived in this time in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1303">We were fortunate that my brother's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so we could move into his, so he had two <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, so we moved in in one <span class="interior space">room</span> and he had one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1304">I had three married sisters, so one of my sisters lived in the place where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was with the other two sisters moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1305">So somehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other <span class="populated place">towns</span> and to bring in the merchandise which was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But in December of 1941, I went once to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, and <span class="populated place">Rzeszowi</span> was a epidemic of dysentery. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And a lot of people died. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And I ate there. </sentence><sentence id="1309">I remember I bought two tomatoes, and | ate the two tomatoes and I came <span class="building">home</span> and I had dysentery. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was  5 very contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery, probably they would have me killed. </sentence><sentence id="1311">So we didn't tell nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1312">I went to the <span class="interior space">attic</span>, and my younger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age. </sentence><sentence id="1313">She was 3 years older. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Her name was Rachel. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And we decided I would be on the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1316">We wouldn't tell nobody, and she was with me during all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1317">She used to give me food, what I could eat, and she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And I somehow survived this dysentery. </sentence><sentence id="1319">We didn't have no injections. </sentence><sentence id="1320">We didn't have no doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and I started to have terrible pain. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And, again, no doctor so home remedies. </sentence><sentence id="1323">We used to put in oil and this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And after 3 weeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was infected. </sentence><sentence id="1325">So this was in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="1326">Somehow my brother got a <span class="spatial object">sleigh</span> with somebody, and they took me out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and they brought me to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, to Dr.Heller. </sentence><sentence id="1327">He was a . </sentence><sentence id="1328">It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And he said that I have to have an operation right away. </sentence><sentence id="1330">If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was around the brain, but he cannot operate. </sentence><sentence id="1331">There is no facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1332">There are no <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, and I cannot go to a <span class="building">non-Jewish hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So I went there with my sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I was there with my sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1335">So I have to go to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1336">How can you go to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1337">Jews are not permitted to ride by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1338">So my brother went back to <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> and somehow he managed to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Farding, by this <span class="building">Land Kommissar</span>, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with my sisters and they took me, with the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1339">On the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, a young Polish boy came up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1340">He said, "What are Jews doing on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="1341">He said, "I'm coming now from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I work in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1343">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, they wouldn't allow Jews on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1344">And he started to speak to the rest of the people. </sentence><sentence id="1345">He said, "We cannot have Jews on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1346">We have to throw them out." </sentence><sentence id="1347">And they came to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So my sister started to cry and to beg. </sentence><sentence id="1349">They said, "Look this man...this boy is almost dead. </sentence><sentence id="1350">He's so sick. </sentence><sentence id="1351">He needs an operations." </sentence><sentence id="1352">My head was all with bandages. </sentence><sentence id="1353">So some people they said, "Well, Let's...let's wait til a <span class="building">station</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1354">There was a <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1355">So this man went down. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He brought up two policemen, German policemen, and he said, "I want you should throw them down because they are Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1357">So we showed him the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1358">So the policeman said, "What...we cannot do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1359">They have the <span class="spatial object">Passier Schein</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1360">That means they have a pass for travel. </sentence><sentence id="1361">So again they started to yell, "Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So we will throw them out." </sentence><sentence id="1363">Again the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay. </sentence><sentence id="1364">We'll not throw you out, but the next stop you have to go out. </sentence><sentence id="1365">So we had to choice. </sentence><sentence id="1366">The next stop. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Meanwhile, they caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Not the Germans, the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1369">So the next <span class="building">station</span> we stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1370">So happens that it was in <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> was quite a big <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I knew <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> because I went to the <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> in <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>, and we had there a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1373">We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span> there was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1374">His name was David Rabinowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief  6 surgeon in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> in a <span class="building">hospital</span> in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And he was thrown out from <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and he came to <span class="populated place">Tarnow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1377">So we came to him, and he looked at me and he said, "I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Everything is already full with puss." </sentence><sentence id="1379">But anyway, they made an operation. </sentence><sentence id="1380">The operation took 8 hours, and he operated and he said, "Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die." </sentence><sentence id="1381">But anyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he even cut the <span class="spatial object">drum</span> for the puss to come out, and then later he sew it. </sentence><sentence id="1382">He was a wonderful man and I became alright and I came <span class="building">home</span> with my head all bandaged and in our <span class="populated place">town</span> they already spoke about it that I'm dead already. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Now I want to tell you what happened to this David Rabinowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1384">He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor couldn't operate on a Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="1385">But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same thing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very delicate operation. </sentence><sentence id="1386">They came to him, and he told them, "I cannot operate on a non-Jew." </sentence><sentence id="1387">So they said, "Listen, you have to save this man." </sentence><sentence id="1388">He went and he operated." </sentence><sentence id="1389">And he saved him. </sentence><sentence id="1390">About a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went to the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="1391">They came to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, and from the <span class="building">hospital</span> they they dragged him out to the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, and they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="1392">They shot him because he operated a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And he saved him. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Well, those were the times. </sentence><sentence id="1395">So when I came <span class="building">home</span>, the whole situation in <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> was already different. </sentence><sentence id="1396">During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in this time that are <span class="populated place">death camps</span>, <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1397">This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any <span class="spatial object">transports</span> yet, but we could feel from the Germans" behavior that every day something else came up. </sentence><sentence id="1398">When I came back so I got back my job. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Instead to go to work, I got back my job to go for merchandise from the other <span class="populated place">towns</span>, and I got the pass. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I took over the <span class="building">ambulatorium</span> from Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I already knew what medicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the <span class="building">Apotheke</span> more medicine so I got a pass that I am in <span class="building">Gesundheitsdienst</span>, which means a health service, that I could go out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> if it's needed, which was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And we lived again in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting <span class="building">home</span> and we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, | o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And what the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere. </sentence><sentence id="1405">So we were sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the <span class="dlf">door</span> downstairs, and from the knocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Not knocking, banging. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And somebody looked through the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">They saw two Gestapo men standing, because their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging. </sentence><sentence id="1409">So the first thing my sisters bolted the <span class="dlf">door</span> from the inside, and the first thing was to hide the men, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="1410">So my brother and I we were <span class="building">home</span>, so we ran out through the <span class="dlf">back door</span> through the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1411">We run out to a neighbor, and we run to the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1412">We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them. </sentence><sentence id="1413">My sister took my father and they put him in the <span class="building">outhouse</span> in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> and put in a padlock on the  <span class="dlf">7 door</span> to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And he was there. </sentence><sentence id="1415">They were banging and banging. </sentence><sentence id="1416">When they saw that not nobody opens and they cannot break down the <span class="dlf">door</span>, one of the Gestapo went around the <span class="building">houses</span> to see to go from the <span class="dlf">back entrance</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good place for my father to be there because they keep banging. </sentence><sentence id="1418">Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she went and she opened the 02:14: <span class="building">outhouse</span> and let out my father. </sentence><sentence id="1419">In this moment, the other Gestapo came from the back and he faced my father. </sentence><sentence id="1420">He first thing, he had a list and he asked my father, "What's your name?" </sentence><sentence id="1421">My father knew that if somebody would be on the list, he would be on the list. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So he said, "My name is Salich." </sentence><sentence id="1423">Was <span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>, but <span class="populated place">Salich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">He looked. </sentence><sentence id="1425">He didn't see no <span class="populated place">Salich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Meanwhile, they dragged out the other...you know when that men from the front broke down the <span class="dlf">door</span>, he took out the other man with him. </sentence><sentence id="1427">His name was Hoofer. </sentence><sentence id="1428">He was not on the list. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And he took him to the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, and he asked this Hoofer, "What is this man's name?" </sentence><sentence id="1430">And he said, "<span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1431">He didn't know why, what, so he said, "<span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1432">Well, so they had him on the list, so they told the other man to go back and they took my father and started to push him towards a <span class="building">wood shed</span> which was in the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And, naturally, we knew, they took out the <span class="spatial object">revolvers</span>, we knew what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1434">So my two sisters, my single two sisters were with him. </sentence><sentence id="1435">They started to scream and they runned to the Gestapo men to try to take out their revolvers. </sentence><sentence id="1436">Why they didn't shoot them I don't understand til now. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So one [sister], the older one, Maddle, went to one and she grabbed his hand and she tried to pull out the revolver from him so he took the revolver and hit her over the head and the head started to bleed and she fell down. </sentence><sentence id="1438">When my second sister, the youngest sister, she was 3 years older than I, saw this. </sentence><sentence id="1439">She run to the second one and started to twist his hand and take out the revolver. </sentence><sentence id="1440">He did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1441">He hit her til she fell down. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And they took my father and they pushed him in this <span class="building">wood shed</span> and I could hear two shots. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Now those shots were the loudest shots I ever heard in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1444">They were something so loud that til today, I hear them. </sentence><sentence id="1445">Til today when I wake up at night, I could hear those two shots. </sentence><sentence id="1446">It was something, and I saw them going in the <span class="building">woodshed</span> from this <span class="dlf">attic window</span>, but I didn't see what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And when they shot and my sisters were there, and they ran in and the two Gestapo men walked out from the <span class="building">wood shed</span> after the two shots. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Then you could hear the screams of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1449">But the screams were not human screams. </sentence><sentence id="1450">They were screams like they would come from <span class="dlf">heaven</span> or from an unnatural animal. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Something...not a human scream. </sentence><sentence id="1452">He started to scream so loud I could hear it in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1453">The first thing he screamed, he said...he started to say Vidui. </sentence><sentence id="1454">Vidui is a prayer when religious Jews say before death. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And then he ended with Shema Yisrael. </sentence><sentence id="1456">He said the Shema so loud that I could...it rings in my...in my ears. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Then later he started to yell Nekuma, nemt Nekuma. </sentence><sentence id="1458">It means revenge, revenge. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And he didn't stop yelling this word revenge and when this...when he started to yell this, the two men, the two Gestapo heard it because they were in the next <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1461">They came back because they heard him still yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1462">They came back and they shot him five times more and he became quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1463">During all the time I was in this <span class="interior space">attic</span>, I...I couldn't...I said to hear my father's being shot....I see it. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I hear it. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I don't do anything? </sentence><sentence id="1466">Why don't you do anying. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Now what could I do? </sentence><sentence id="1468">I wanted to say something. </sentence><sentence id="1469"><span class="dlf">I  8</span> couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1470">I wanted to move. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I was like a piece of stone. </sentence><sentence id="1473">After it was quiet I said to my brother, "I'm going down." </sentence><sentence id="1474">And when I came down, so the two Gestapo men and I remember, they were young, tall, blond, handsome, and one's name...I remember his name...because I saw him before. </sentence><sentence id="1475">His name was Norman. </sentence><sentence id="1476"><span class="populated place">Norman</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I'm trying to get now his picture. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And they were still standing with their <span class="spatial object">revolvers</span> in their hand. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And when they saw me and they saw my head was all full of with bandages because this was from the operation, so they thought maybe I was wounded today because there was so much shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And usually somebody was wounded, they finished him off. </sentence><sentence id="1481">So they came...one came into me, took out his revolver. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And with him was a young Jewish policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1483">So he asked him, "Where was he wounded?" </sentence><sentence id="1484">He said, "No, he wasn't wounded. </sentence><sentence id="1485">He just came back from the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1486">He had an operation on his head." </sentence><sentence id="1487">So he put back his revolver, and I went back to see where my father was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And then I saw my mother, with the sister, and those little babies, 3 years old, my nieces, beautiful babies like angels were sitting there and crying. </sentence><sentence id="1489">They probably didn't know what the crying is for, but everybody is crying, they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And I could see my mother, my sisters laying over my father and kissing his face and caressing him and he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1491">One hand was ripped, broken off because when they shot him they hit the hand and the bullets hit the bones and the hand was...you could see the hand laying in the side. : </sentence><sentence id="1492">And he was laying there and they were crying and kissing him. </sentence><sentence id="1493">One thing I want to tell you before...before this day. </sentence><sentence id="1494">About a week before, this Pasha Rappaport, the new president from the Judenrat came, to the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> and he had a list of about 15 Jews who had long beards and he gave a note that the Jews should cut off their beards, that Farding, the Landkommissar told him that when he brings his friends to visit the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, he's very much embarrassed to see so many Jews with beards. </sentence><sentence id="1495">So he wants the beards should be cut off. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And my father was on the list that they had to cut off the beard. </sentence><sentence id="1497">For my father to cut off the beard was the worse thing because since his beard started to grow, he never touched a hair, even in the first world war in the army, he never touched the beard. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So we called a young boy a barber to our <span class="building">home</span> to cut his beard. </sentence><sentence id="1499">So he begged him to leave him a little bit here. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And when he cut it, my father was sitting, he was pale like it was white, and after he finished he got up and in Yiddish he said, "Jetzt hob Ich gefielt dem Ta'am miesse".. It means now I felt the taste of death when he cut this beard. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And when we looked on my father we didn't recognize him. </sentence><sentence id="1502">He looked like a strange person because we were always used to seeing him with a full grey beard. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And here he's shaven. </sentence><sentence id="1504">It looked like a different person. </sentence><sentence id="1505">This a week before he was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1506">After he was shot, the Gestapo came back and they told me with this young Jewish policeman and they said, "We want you should go and gather together all the dead people and bring them to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> to be buried." </sentence><sentence id="1507">So he took me and we went to somebody who had a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and the men were shot, and you could hear from different <span class="building">houses</span> screaming, yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1508">This day they came and they had a list of 20 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Because they said they're going to kill one percent of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1510">There were two thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1511">So they had a list of 20 Jews, the most prominent Jews from before the war to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1512">But the end was they they killed 22. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I don't know by mistake or just for good  9 measure. </sentence><sentence id="1514">You know, when you buy something, you add...but they killed 22. </sentence><sentence id="1515">So we went and we started to get together those dead people on the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> to take them to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1516">I went alone. </sentence><sentence id="1517">I didn't feel anything in this time even my father was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1518">But my father always had a reserved place on the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> near his father. </sentence><sentence id="1519">Now we are <span class="populated place">Kohanim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I don't know if you know, Kohanim means from the priestly family. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And this goes over from father to son from father to son, father son. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Because the Kohanim cannot go on the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, so usually the Kohanim, the priests were buried right by the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1523">There was a big <span class="dlf">road</span> in the middle of the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1524">On both sides the <span class="building">Kohanim</span> were buried. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1526">So their children could come closer to their <span class="dlf">graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1527">So my father's father which I am named after him was buried there, and my father always had a reserved place to be buried next to him. </sentence><sentence id="1528">We knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="1529">So we decided, my brother and I that we would bury my father next to him. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Even[though] the general said to make one common grave. </sentence><sentence id="1531">So what we did, when we came a few times to pick up the people. </sentence><sentence id="1532">So then later we put our father so that his leg should stick out and I told my brother, my brother-in-law that when we will go through with the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, they should wait by my grandfather's <span class="dlf">grave</span> and pull him out and we'll make a <span class="dlf">grave</span> near his father, at least this to do for him that he should be buried near his father. </sentence><sentence id="1533">We came. </sentence><sentence id="1534">They waited. </sentence><sentence id="1535">We pulled him out. </sentence><sentence id="1536">We started to make the <span class="interior space">common grave</span> for everybody, but my father was buried near my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="1537">The <span class="dlf">grave</span> for all the people were made next to the <span class="interior space">common grave</span> from the pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="1538">As I told you, May the 6th, 1919, nine Jews were killed and all the nine were buried in a <span class="interior space">common grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1539">So we made the <span class="dlf">grave</span> next to them for all the rest of people. </sentence><sentence id="1540">We didn't make a deep <span class="dlf">grave</span> because it started to be dark so we just made a shallow <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1541">We covered them, and we said we'll come back tomorrow to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="1542">We came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1543">I came <span class="building">home</span> and my <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And my mother started...was sitting and crying. </sentence><sentence id="1545">She said, "They took away my crown...my crown," because he was the crown of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And we were sitting a whole night, and the next day my brother, my brother-in-law and I and other people went back to make the proper burial. </sentence><sentence id="1547">Everybody brought in for the parents a <span class="spatial object">tallit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1548">It means a prayer shawl. </sentence><sentence id="1549">We brought in like shrouds. </sentence><sentence id="1550">Now we didn't prepare shrouds, but every Jew had a kittel, a white coat that he wore three times...twice a year. </sentence><sentence id="1551">He wore it on Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="1552">He wore it Passover to the Seder, and he was buried in it. </sentence><sentence id="1553">So we brought it for my father to put him in in it. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Also, we took a sack with wood because the wood where we was shot in the <span class="building">wood shed</span> was sprinkled, soaked with blood and we believe in the Jewish tradition, we believe that the blood is the soul of the person and we wanted this should be buried, so we took the wood and we put it in the <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1555">We opened the <span class="dlf">grave</span> and made it deep. </sentence><sentence id="1556">We put in the <span class="building">kittel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1557">We put in the prayer shawl, and we buried him next to my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="1558">We did the same thing with the other people. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Also there is a tradition that if somebody is killed, when he is buried to put in a 02:27: knife in his right hand. </sentence><sentence id="1560">The belief is that this is for revenge. </sentence><sentence id="1561">He should revenge his death. </sentence><sentence id="1562">So we brought knives and we put in everybody's hand a knife. </sentence><sentence id="1563">We also put in a knife in my father's hand. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And we buried them, and when we came back I stopped by a <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1565">I didn't cry all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And I burst out and crying. </sentence><sentence id="1567">I couldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="1568">And I with a such a loud a voice said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="1569">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1570">Why?" </sentence><sentence id="1571">And for about a half hour I was standing near a <span class="env feature">tree</span> crying and crying. </sentence><sentence id="1572"> 0 Well, I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1573">I couldn't cry anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1574">We came <span class="building">home</span>, and we sat down to Shivah, which is 7 days of mourning. </sentence><sentence id="1575">Now when I sat down, my father he believed in Jahrzeit. </sentence><sentence id="1576">Jahrzeit means that we on the day of the death we commemorate the dead person, and as we have this commemoration we say Kaddish and other prayers. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Also we light a candle, a <span class="spatial object">Jahrzeit lamp</span>, a candle in a glass which lasted 24 hours. </sentence><sentence id="1578">Now in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> you couldn't buy candles for Jahrzeit. </sentence><sentence id="1579">Here you go in a <span class="building">supermarket</span>, you can buy as many candles as you want. </sentence><sentence id="1580">In a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, you cannot buy candles. </sentence><sentence id="1581">My father had Jahrzeit after his father 13 days in the month of <span class="populated place">Ijar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1582">This was in the spring. </sentence><sentence id="1583">This was in the spring...13 days, and he prepared a whole year pieces of wax, pieces of paraffin, paraffin and he collected it and he wanted to make for his day to commemorate his death, this 24 hour glass with paraffin for his father 13 days in <span class="populated place">Jjar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1584">It took him a whole year to collect this paraffin. </sentence><sentence id="1585">He never did it because he was shot 11 days of the month of <span class="populated place">Ijar</span>, 2 days earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1586">So when I came back, he was shot Il days[in the month of <span class="spatial object">jar</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="1587">When I came back from the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, it was 12 days in the month of jar. </sentence><sentence id="1588">I went and I made a wick, I melted the paraffin and I made this Yahrzeit candle for 24 hours, and when I lit it, I lit it for both of them. </sentence><sentence id="1589">For my father who prepared it for his father, which was a day later. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And after my father was shot, the whole situation in our <span class="building">home</span> changed. </sentence><sentence id="1591">Because even he was not active during the war, he was 60 years old, and the Germans made the list, because he was 60 years old, that means that he was unproductive. </sentence><sentence id="1592">Because til 60 you were productive. </sentence><sentence id="1593">You could do something, where[as] by 60 you were not any more productive. </sentence><sentence id="1594">So you had to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1595">He was 60 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1596">And the life changed completely. </sentence><sentence id="1597">Our life, we had to go every day to pray. </sentence><sentence id="1598">Well, there was no prayers, but in somebody's <span class="interior space">basement</span> a few people came together to have Minyan, to have 10 people, and we pray for it. </sentence><sentence id="1599">So this was the first victim of my family that was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Now my brother, who was in the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> in the first <span class="building">Judenrat</span>, he was arrested also. </sentence><sentence id="1601">And all of them were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1602">My father was let out. </sentence><sentence id="1603">He wasn't killed. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Now I don't know if you want to know the reason why he wasn't killed. </sentence><sentence id="1605">It...it's not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1607">So this he was, my father was the first victim from our family. </sentence><sentence id="1608">After this killing when they killed the 22 Jews in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, every day, every day something new....and we felt in the <span class="env feature">air</span> that something...the Germans are pushing too much, with too much orders...one order after the other that we couldn't finish the first one, a new order came in. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Two weeks later, the Judenrat, the whole community...the leaders, were called to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> who was the capitol of the state seat the Germans called it the Gauleihter. </sentence><sentence id="1610"><span class="populated place">Gau</span> was like a <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And this...we belonged to them. </sentence><sentence id="1612">They called all the presidents and all the members of the Judenrat to this <span class="populated place">town</span> and there was a <span class="building">Dr.Ehrhaus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1613">He was the <span class="building">Kreishauptmann</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1614"><span class="populated place">Kreishauptmann</span> was like head of state. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And Dr. Ehrhaus was a major in the SS, and he got together all the Jews...their leaders from all the <span class="region">State</span> and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="1616">He had a paper and he read, "As the Jews are filthy. </sentence><sentence id="1617">Full of lice. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And because they are so filthy, there is an epidemic of a typhus in our <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1619">I am putting in Polish . </sentence><sentence id="1620">Kontributsia, means they have to pay so much money. </sentence><sentence id="1621">And he gave out <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> a million zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1622">This <span class="populated place">town</span> so many...200,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1623"><span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> 360,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And each <span class="populated place">town</span> had to pay so much money. </sentence><sentence id="1625">He said, "In a week, you bring the money. </sentence><sentence id="1626">If you will not bring the money, how much money you will be short, so much percent people who will take from your Judenrat, from your council, and we will shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="1627">If there is 10 percent less, we will shoot 10 percent. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Twenty percent, we shoot twenty percent." </sentence><sentence id="1629">Pashek Rappaport who was the Aelteste, who was the president with all the members of the Judenrat came back to our <span class="populated place">town</span> and they  1 told this, that they need 360,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being in the war and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, people starved because at this time people started to starve. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And every day we find, did you hear this man starved...this man starved...this. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Started to starve. </sentence><sentence id="1633">They didn't have what to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1634">So to get together 360,000 <span class="spatial object">slotas</span> is impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1635">We started to collect. </sentence><sentence id="1636">The next day they had to go back with the whole member{[ship] and everybody from the Judenrat knew that there is a shortage so much, so many will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Again, they took them in the same <span class="interior space">room</span> and everybody had a burlap sack with money and asked them, "How much you have? </sentence><sentence id="1638">How much you have?" </sentence><sentence id="1639">Only our <span class="populated place">town</span>, only <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>, had the full amount, 360,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1640">All the other <span class="populated place">towns</span> were missing. </sentence><sentence id="1641">Like for instance, <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> needed a million zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1642">They only had 750,000. </sentence><sentence id="1643">It means 25 percent was missing. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Right away, he took out 25 percent from their members of the <span class="building">Jewish council</span>, put them in aside. </sentence><sentence id="1645">The other <span class="populated place">town</span>, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And I had a list, exactly <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, <span class="populated place">Barzava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1647">I remember all the names, and in the book I have every amount and they took out so many people, they took them out in the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, and in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> they took out the machine gun and they shot them...25 percent or how much was this. </sentence><sentence id="1648">After they were shot, they got together what was remaining. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Ehrenhaus came back again with a new list and he said, "Within a week, you go back. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Every <span class="populated place">community</span> has to pay taxes from 1914 til today, if some Jew owes taxes." </sentence><sentence id="1651">Now there were Jews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their <span class="populated place">fatherland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1652">There were Jews who left for <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1653">There were Jews who died, didn't leave no nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1654">The <span class="populated place">community</span> was responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Every Jew...the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> 02:36: had to pay up the taxes from 1914. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Not only this, every Pole can put in a claim that a Jew owes him money without any documentation that he owes him money and the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> has to pay him within a week. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And again what percentage will be missing, so much will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1658">They come back and this was a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1659">Here we got 360,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1660">We didn't know how it was collected. </sentence><sentence id="1661">People are starving, and here they want we should pay off taxes from 1914 til today for people who don't exist anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1662">Right away the Director of Internal Revenue was notified. </sentence><sentence id="1663">He had to dig out books who were laying, covered with dusk and he started to add and to add. </sentence><sentence id="1664">We figured out, I say we the Jews figured out that we will have a half a million slotas to pay for those things which was impossible to collect. </sentence><sentence id="1665">But this we figured. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And the Poles were notified that everybody can claim their debt what the Jews owed them. </sentence><sentence id="1667">Imagine if they had a free hand to clam money and the way they loved us, imagine how many claims came in, without documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1668">One episode I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1669">There was a man. </sentence><sentence id="1670">His name was Fritz. </sentence><sentence id="1671">Jan Fritz. </sentence><sentence id="1672">He had a small <span class="building">store</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and he used to buy by my father. </sentence><sentence id="1673">He always used to owe my father money. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I remember when the war broke out he owed us thousand zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1675">He never paid it. </sentence><sentence id="1676">He came in and had a claim that my father owed him 5,000 slotas. </sentence><sentence id="1677">As I could go out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I knew him, I went to him. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And I said, "Fritz, you owed us money. </sentence><sentence id="1679">How could you come in and to say that my father owes you 5,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1680">You know this is a lie." </sentence><sentence id="1681">He said, "If you will not go out this minute, I will raise it to 10,000 slotas." </sentence><sentence id="1682">And he could do it. </sentence><sentence id="1683">I didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I went out. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Well, anyway, the claims from the Poles with the taxes came out to a million zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1686">Now how can you collect from the poor, wretched Jews who are in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>,  2 who are already in the war 2 years, starving, to get a million slotas. </sentence><sentence id="1687">Again, got together and this time they used force. </sentence><sentence id="1688">They beat up some people, but anyway, in a week it had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1689">In a week they went back. </sentence><sentence id="1690">Only <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>, only our <span class="populated place">town</span>, had a million slotas. </sentence><sentence id="1691">The rest didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Again the same story. </sentence><sentence id="1693">How much it was missing, they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="1694">We came back. </sentence><sentence id="1695">After 02:39: they paid, and they were shot, he came out a <span class="building">house</span>, again, with a new list. </sentence><sentence id="1696">He said, "This time, within 7 days, every Jew had to leave the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1697">I'm sorry, not 7 days, 3 days. " </sentence><sentence id="1698">After 3 days, within 3 days, you have time 3 days, to leave <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And then all the <span class="populated place">towns</span> from all the <span class="region">sections</span> had to be relocated to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and to clear out of our <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Of course, later we find out this was their methods. </sentence><sentence id="1701">They wanted to have the Jews in one place. </sentence><sentence id="1702">So when they came back, this was the worst thing. </sentence><sentence id="1703">The money somehow they sold the last thing, and we sold it to the Polish people for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Like everything what we had, we sold it just to get money. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And they got everything for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1706">But the last order was the worst order. </sentence><sentence id="1707">We will leave our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1708">In our <span class="populated place">town</span> somehow, everybody had somebody, acquaintances. </sentence><sentence id="1709">Some people who could smuggle in. </sentence><sentence id="1710">We even had peasants we knew. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Here we'll go to some place. </sentence><sentence id="1712">Nobody knows nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1713">How will we survive with the children? </sentence><sentence id="1714">And this was the worst thing that would happen til now. </sentence><sentence id="1715">We had to leave our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And we started to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1717">The peasants were notified that they should come the next day with <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, line up outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Eight in the morning the <span class="dlf">doors</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were opened. </sentence><sentence id="1719">They came in, and everybody could pick up a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1720">They said you can take along anything you want. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And they gave us <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1722">The reason why, they wanted we should take along anything...only not <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, because they wanted to accumulate, to assemble all the things that Jews have in one place, to be easier for them to take it away. </sentence><sentence id="1723">So the peasants were lined up and we started to load the people the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Now I went out and I picked out two <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> with two horses each, peasants that I knew from my family to load everything what we had. </sentence><sentence id="1725">Now we decided to go the first day because my brother when he was released from <span class="building">jail</span>, he became friendly with one German policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1726">And this German policeman helped him to get out of <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1727">So he asked him, "What should we do? </sentence><sentence id="1728">Should we go with the last day or the first day?" </sentence><sentence id="1729">He said, "Go with the first day, because it's in the hands of the Gestapo, and you never know what they will do. </sentence><sentence id="1730">Maybe there will be too many people in the other <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1731">They will come and they will kill everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So go the first day." </sentence><sentence id="1733">So my family went the first day. </sentence><sentence id="1734">We loaded the <span class="spatial object">sacks</span> with everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And there was a <span class="dlf">line</span>, and they moved, we went 31 kilometers to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Now nobody could sit on their <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1737">Old people, children, everybody had to walk on the right side of the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Walk the 31 kilometers to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1739">You want me to stop now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="2215">That's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2218">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2219">So this how we were chased out from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2220">There was one episode that I have to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2221">There was a man. </sentence><sentence id="2222">He actually was from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2223">He was a Jew from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2224">He  3 came back to our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in- law, and father-in-law, after the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2225">But in one moment he made a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="2226">Instead to be on the right side, he was on the left side. </sentence><sentence id="2227">A German policeman which was from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I remember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him. </sentence><sentence id="2229">He fell down. </sentence><sentence id="2230">His wife and his child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what happened with him. </sentence><sentence id="2231">He was left laying on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2232">They had to go forward. </sentence><sentence id="2233">Now I went to the third day, not the first day. </sentence><sentence id="2234">The reason I went the third day because we still had things and merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Maybe we'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Maybe we'll retrieve it. </sentence><sentence id="2237">So after the Jews went out with their <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, we went and we took this men on the <span class="spatial object">hand wagon</span> and we brought him to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and we buried him. </sentence><sentence id="2238">And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue stripes, and he had yellow shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2239">Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he was from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2240">He had modern clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2241">So I remember the grey suit with blue, not stripes, blue squares. </sentence><sentence id="2242">And we buried him. </sentence><sentence id="2243">About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came back, I had to go to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> because they killed somebody and I went to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="2244">You see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person. </sentence><sentence id="2245">The minute my father was kalled, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me. </sentence><sentence id="2246">I wanted to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2247">I wanted to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2248">And before I never saw it. </sentence><sentence id="2249">So somebody was killed, so I took him to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2250">When I took him to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, the caretaker of the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, he was an old Polish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2251">So we buried him. </sentence><sentence id="2252">I knew that he wouldn't let it go. </sentence><sentence id="2253">He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it. </sentence><sentence id="2254">Now we were in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2255">They brought into <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2256">In <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> were in this time about 30,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2257">They brought into <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> from this <span class="populated place">town</span> maybe other 40,000 Jews from all the little <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2258">There was not enough place...I'm not talking about <span class="building">apartments</span> or to have a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over your head. </sentence><sentence id="2259">There was not enough place in the <span class="dlf">alley ways</span>, on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, for all the Jews to put some place. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And they came with those <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2261">They brought their things, some better, some worse. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings the Jews to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2263">If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2264">In case the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they didn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks. </sentence><sentence id="2265">This was his pay. </sentence><sentence id="2266">He can go <span class="building">home</span> what they put on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and take it for himself because they didn't pay him. </sentence><sentence id="2267">So a lot of people didn't have the 200 <span class="spatial object">slotas</span> so they took away right away which didn't make a difference. </sentence><sentence id="2268">The Germans took it away later. </sentence><sentence id="2269">So I came to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> the third day, and <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> was...sometimes if you talk about <span class="building">tower of Babel</span> how the people couldn't understand [one another]. </sentence><sentence id="2270">This was the tower of <span class="populated place">Babel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2271">People were running around like crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2272">Children lost their parents. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Parents lost their 02:47: children. </sentence><sentence id="2274">They tried to find themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2275">Imagine to bring in so many people from different places. </sentence><sentence id="2276">And on the way so many people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2277">Like this woman lost her husband. </sentence><sentence id="2278">And then a woman with children, the husband was killed because he did something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2279">He went on the left side instead of the right side. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Everybody was lost. </sentence><sentence id="2281">And then to feed those  4 people. </sentence><sentence id="2282">It was impossible to feed so many people who came in in one day. </sentence><sentence id="2283">Because they all had to come in within 3 days from all the <span class="populated place">towns</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="2284">To have places, I'm not talking sanitary places, but for anything, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2285">It was the worst sight that a person can ever imagine; some horror story, some horror picture, the people were put together. </sentence><sentence id="2286">This was it. </sentence><sentence id="2287">When they were there, came out an order that the 7th of July and this was a week later, the people from this and this <span class="region">section</span> have to assemble in this and this place, and they will be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="2288">Nobody knew that there are <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2289">Nobody knew in this time that there are <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2290">Would the people know that they are <span class="populated place">death camps</span>, like my family and my sisters, we could run away. </sentence><sentence id="2291">We had peasants that we knew. </sentence><sentence id="2292">I don't know if we would succeed to survive, but at least we would try. </sentence><sentence id="2293">Like those Jews I later joined them in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, what they never went with this <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2294">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2295">We figured they would send us in <span class="populated place">camps</span> to work or something. </sentence><sentence id="2296">The rumor was they're going to send us to the <span class="region">east</span> to the <span class="country">Ukraine</span> to work in <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2297">We didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="2298">They assembled...in one day, they assembled 30,000 Jews or 25,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2299">This was the first day on the <span class="dlf">Umschlagplatz</span> be taken to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2300">Jews could take only one <span class="spatial object">bundle</span> with them. </sentence><sentence id="2301">Now everything they told them to take along to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> they were allowed...this was a calculated thing, so if they had to leave in their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2302">Now, what they did, there was a big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2303">In every <span class="populated place">town</span>, there was a big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and later made it a small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2304">This was a big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2305">So they took the people from this and this <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2306">They cleaned them out. </sentence><sentence id="2307">They left everything <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2308">This way they had a chance to go in and to clean out everything. </sentence><sentence id="2309">The people came to the <span class="building">Umschlagplatz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2310">The <span class="dlf">Umschlagplatz</span> was a terrible, a terrible scene. </sentence><sentence id="2311">I wasn't there, but later I was told. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Before the Jews came in, they had to leave their <span class="spatial object">bundle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Then later they took 2 girls, 3 girls, beautiful girls and they told them to go around and collect all valuables from the people, to collect money, to collect gold, to collect watches, and they did baskets. </sentence><sentence id="2314">They brought them over where the Gestapo was standing, where the SS were standing. </sentence><sentence id="2315">They were SS men, all drunk. </sentence><sentence id="2316">Later, they still didn't believe that Jews gave everything. </sentence><sentence id="2317">So they went and they pointed out young girls. </sentence><sentence id="2318">It so happens that they pointed out one of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="2319">A beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="2320">Her name was Susza Fein, and they put her and they undressed her and they started to look in every place if she didn't conceal something. </sentence><sentence id="2321">She was in this time 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And they did it so cruel that they used instruments that they cut open her belly. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And they looked that the Jews didn't hide something. </sentence><sentence id="2324">The Kolbuszowa Rabbi, an old man of about 75 years was standing and he was blind. </sentence><sentence id="2325">So they came to him and they asked him something and he couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2326">So they took out a revolver and they went to shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="2327">He had two granddaughters. </sentence><sentence id="2328">One was 16 and one was 18. </sentence><sentence id="2329">Beautiful girls. </sentence><sentence id="2330">They started to beg this SS men. </sentence><sentence id="2331">He's our grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="2332">He was the Rabbi of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Please don't shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="2334">He will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="2335">So they shot him, and they shot the two girls in the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Well, anyway, they took away 6,000 Jews, elderly, crippled, children and they took them away and they had to walk to a <span class="populated place">town</span> near ?? , </sentence><sentence id="2337">They had prepared <span class="dlf">ditches</span> in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and those people were killed in those <span class="dlf">ditches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2338">The rest they took to the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> and they were transported to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2339">On the way to the <span class="spatial object">railroad</span>, they were shooting in the <span class="spatial object">columns</span> that a few hundred people remained dead on the <span class="dlf">street</span> laying where they were shooting. </sentence><sentence id="2340">They put in the people in the <span class="spatial object">railroad trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2341">In the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> before they put in the people, they put on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> untreated lime. </sentence><sentence id="2342">I don't know...lime if it is not treated and if it's mixed with water, it starts to boil and it start to give out gas. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So those were untreated lime, because they knew that soon the <span class="interior space">floor</span> will  5 be wet and then the gases will come out and then people will choke. </sentence><sentence id="2344">Instead to take from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span> by <span class="spatial object">train</span> would take 3 hours, it took them 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="2345">When the people came to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>, they opened the <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2346">More than 50 percent were dead. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And then they had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="2348">We find this out later. </sentence><sentence id="2349">We, at this time we didn't know...we...well, I jumped a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2350">L..I will tell you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2485">Q: I need you to stick to what you saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2487">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2488">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2490">So when we came to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>...when I came the third day, and when I saw those things what's going on there with the people. </sentence><sentence id="2491">So Farding gave out an order that he needs...you see, our <span class="populated place">town</span>...there were four <span class="populated place">towns</span> belonged to our <span class="populated place">town</span>...our <span class="region">county</span>...that he needs hundred young boys for each <span class="populated place">town</span> to go back, and he will make a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2492">The reason...we should destroy, taking apart the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2493">To <span class="populated place">Sokolov</span>, <span class="populated place">Glogov</span>, ?? , </sentence><sentence id="2494">and ?? . </sentence><sentence id="2495">I volunteered with my brother to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2496">The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be back. </sentence><sentence id="2497">I have peasants that I know. </sentence><sentence id="2498">I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, because in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> they would starve. </sentence><sentence id="2499">But without sending them somehow, we would. </sentence><sentence id="2500">So we went back. </sentence><sentence id="2501">We walked a whole night back. </sentence><sentence id="2502">In the morning we were taken into the <span class="building">Shul</span>, to the <span class="building">temple</span>, to the <span class="building">Houses of Study</span>, and this became our <span class="building">barracks</span>, and this became our new life to be in a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2503">Meanwhile the people were taken to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>, and they were made four <span class="spatial object">transports</span> from the people. </sentence><sentence id="2504">In the four <span class="spatial object">transports</span> within every week two <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, and they cleared up the big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the large <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and everybody was left who had a card to work, they put in the small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2505">And the small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and they liquidated the big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and we were in this time in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2506">And we started to work as a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2507">What we did in the beginning we started to destroy the <span class="building">houses</span>, taking apart. </sentence><sentence id="2508">We saved everything for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2509">For the Germans was very important to have old material, scrap, because they could make new material. </sentence><sentence id="2510">So we picked out one <span class="building">house</span>, and one <span class="interior space">room</span> was paper, and one was brass and lead and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2511">And we destroyed this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2512">Destroying the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was a very painful thing because we knew the people. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And we destroyed 300 years of a continuation of people who lived in this <span class="populated place">town</span> for 300 years, they were conceived in those <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2514">They died in those <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2515">They were married in those <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2516">And now the people are gone, and the <span class="building">houses</span> are being destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2517">We threw down from the <span class="interior space">attics</span> things that you would never believe that people saved those things. </sentence><sentence id="2518">And you could see the poverty of the people. </sentence><sentence id="2519">They never throw out anything. </sentence><sentence id="2520">Old <span class="spatial object">iron beds</span>, old <span class="spatial object">iron stoves</span>, <span class="spatial object">barrels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2521">Everything we threw it out. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And then later the <span class="building">house</span> came down. </sentence><sentence id="2523">We knocked it down. </sentence><sentence id="2524">You could see the dust, and the dust went up and then you could see 300 years of life in this little <span class="populated place">Stetl</span>, that it was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2525">We cleared the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2526">We made a <span class="dlf">field</span> out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And we still didn't know what happened to our people. </sentence><sentence id="2528">So we sent...we took a <span class="country">Pole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2529">We paid him money, and we send him to go with the <span class="dlf">road</span> where the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went and then he came back and he told us the story. </sentence><sentence id="2530">That they were taken to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>, and then we find out that they are <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2531">This was the first time that they sent to <span class="populated place">death camps</span>, which <span class="populated place">Belzec</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="2532">They tried out how to do it, so <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>...it was not a crema...it was not <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> like in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, sophisticated with Zyklon. </sentence><sentence id="2533">In <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>, they had old <span class="spatial object">motors</span>, and then with the gas, with the carbon monoxide and then later they buried the people. </sentence><sentence id="2534">They burned them. </sentence><sentence id="2535">This how we find out that our people are dead. </sentence><sentence id="2536">We  6 worked in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and there was not any more work. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Why would they keep us. </sentence><sentence id="2538">So they get us...we had a <span class="env feature">river</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2539">So he get us to regulate the <span class="env feature">river</span>, to make it straight the <span class="dlf">banks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2540">So we worked there. </sentence><sentence id="2541">But soon we knew that we will what will they need? </sentence><sentence id="2542">Farding played around with us. </sentence><sentence id="2543">We were like his small army. </sentence><sentence id="2544">We had between our people a man. </sentence><sentence id="2545">His name was Lampel. </sentence><sentence id="2546">He was a sergeant in the Austrian army. </sentence><sentence id="2547">He was a drill sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="2548">So he told them to drill us, and we used to march like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2549">02:58 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2621">A: We worked in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2622">And we had [it] quite good. </sentence><sentence id="2623">The reason why? </sentence><sentence id="2624">We didn't have no German guards. </sentence><sentence id="2625">All the <span class="populated place">towns</span> around us were <span class="populated place">Judenrein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2626">There were no Jews around anymore because all the Jews were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="2627">We had in our <span class="region">section</span>, we had a few <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>, which the German organized. </sentence><sentence id="2628">One was in <span class="populated place">Breshatka</span>, and one was in <span class="populated place">Hutta Komarovska</span>, and one was in <span class="populated place">Mielec</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2629"><span class="populated place">Mielec</span> was quite known, because this was the second place that they tattooed people. </sentence><sentence id="2630">They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL.KL it means <span class="building">Konzentrations Lager</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2631">Now if some people had the <span class="populated place">KL</span>, I know they were in <span class="populated place">Mielec</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And this was very close to us. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And we didn't have no guards. </sentence><sentence id="2634">It means that we were on our own. </sentence><sentence id="2635">But Farding got us together, and he said, "If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10 will be hanged." </sentence><sentence id="2636">He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape. </sentence><sentence id="2637">And every day we went to work. </sentence><sentence id="2638">Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it was very...there was one <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Sokolow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2639"><span class="populated place">Sokolow</span> belonged to us....to our <span class="region">county</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2640">The night of the expulsion of the Jews in <span class="populated place">Sokolow</span>, when they told them to go to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Farding</span> came to <span class="populated place">Sokolow</span> drunk. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And he said he wants Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2642">So they started to bring him old Jews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something. </sentence><sentence id="2643">He wanted and so they brought them...and he started to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And he killed in this night...he killed 49 Jews by himself with his own hand. </sentence><sentence id="2645">He was drunk. </sentence><sentence id="2646">He had a bottle of vodka. </sentence><sentence id="2647">He drank Vodka, and he killed. </sentence><sentence id="2648">They brought him Jews and he killed. </sentence><sentence id="2649">There was a pile of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2650">But he was such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told you before he spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2651">He said, "He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher. </sentence><sentence id="2652">They should go straight to <span class="dlf">heaven</span> because they will be kosher." </sentence><sentence id="2653">And he told them he's going to do with the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2654">Ifa chicken had to be made kosher, and if it had to be soaked in water, then later put in salt on all sides, and then later this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the chicken to see if everything is correct. </sentence><sentence id="2655">So he got the two Jews holding candles. </sentence><sentence id="2656">He had there a bag of salt. </sentence><sentence id="2657">And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he said, "You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to Heaven." </sentence><sentence id="2658">Those were the things to add to all that terrible things they did. </sentence><sentence id="2659">They played with us, like a cat plays with a mouse before...before it [kills]...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3833">A: Crochet. </sentence><sentence id="3834">She didn't have too much wool then. </sentence><sentence id="3835">So she crocheted it very fast. </sentence><sentence id="3836">So they asked her, "Why you rushing things." </sentence><sentence id="3837">She said, "I wanted to finish before I'm out of wool." </sentence><sentence id="3838">So the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="3839">I want to tell you the story before we're out of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3847">Q: We have time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3849">A: Well, anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3850">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3851">So we started to be in very bad [shape]. </sentence><sentence id="3852">Instead of go[ing] together to do something against the Germans, to destroy something, to blow up <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, our most energy was to be on the watch for the peasants and for the AK. </sentence><sentence id="3853">In the book, I'm describing episodes practically from so many who were killed, but now it's no time.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3859">Q: I would like to hear it. </sentence><sentence id="3860">No, I would like an episode. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3863">A: So I will give you for instance one episode. </sentence><sentence id="3864">I find out that one of my friends who went with me to <span class="building">school</span> for seven years. </sentence><sentence id="3865">His name was Fascick Augustin. </sentence><sentence id="3866">His father was a very good friend of my father. </sentence><sentence id="3867">They were very wealthy peasants. </sentence><sentence id="3868">They had an estate. </sentence><sentence id="3869">But his father was the president of all kinds of monopoly from the Polish government. </sentence><sentence id="3870">Like kerosene, salt, matches. </sentence><sentence id="3871">This was Polish monopoly, and we had to buy it through him. </sentence><sentence id="3872">So they became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="3873">Even he was on the board of the same <span class="building">bank</span> as my father was, and they became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="3874">And with this boy I was friendly. </sentence><sentence id="3875">We went to <span class="building">school</span>, was sitting next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="3876">I find out that this boy...this Fascick Augustin became commandant from the <span class="spatial object">AK</span> in our <span class="region">section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3877">Now, I don't have to explain now the <span class="country">AK</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3878">You know it, but if there it needs some explanation, this was the <span class="interior space">underground</span> which was directed from the <span class="populated place">London</span> government in exile. </sentence><sentence id="3879">And AK means in Polish "<span class="building">Armia Krajowa</span>". </sentence><sentence id="3880">It means the <span class="building">home army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3881">So when I find out, here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant, the best thing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group. </sentence><sentence id="3882">This was the time when our leader was killed, and I became the commandant from our group. </sentence><sentence id="3883">So I said I will come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in. </sentence><sentence id="3884">Not only that we will be able to fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us. </sentence><sentence id="3885">I sent over a girl who belonged to the organization. </sentence><sentence id="3886">This is the woman whom I brought over last year. </sentence><sentence id="3887">And we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me. </sentence><sentence id="3888">He prepared there a place, a <span class="building">meeting place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3889">We came to the <span class="populated place">meeting place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3890">This is complicated, how and what, when. </sentence><sentence id="3891">But, anyway, I came there with my brother. </sentence><sentence id="3892">And he was very happy to see me. </sentence><sentence id="3893">The meeting place was made in a <span class="building">stable</span> between the section of cows and the section of horses and there where the animals ate the hay, this was removable. </sentence><sentence id="3894">We could go in that nobody could see. </sentence><sentence id="3895">They cut the <span class="dlf">locks</span> and this was a small place about, I would say about 8 by 12. </sentence><sentence id="3896">And then we came in, and they were very happy to see us. </sentence><sentence id="3897">He grabbed me and kissed me. </sentence><sentence id="3898">He said we will  6 kill Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3899">We'll survive the war. </sentence><sentence id="3900">And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we were infested with lice. </sentence><sentence id="3901">In the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, we didn't have no changes. </sentence><sentence id="3902">So he said, "Take off those rags." </sentence><sentence id="3903">And he brought me fresh underwear. </sentence><sentence id="3904">I put on the fresh underwear. </sentence><sentence id="3905">My brother put on the fresh underwear. </sentence><sentence id="3906">And then they brought us food. </sentence><sentence id="3907">Then we made plans. </sentence><sentence id="3908">And then his...he had an older brother. </sentence><sentence id="3909">The older brother was Yashik was his name. </sentence><sentence id="3910">It was a little complicated. </sentence><sentence id="3911"><span class="populated place">Stashik</span> and <span class="building">Yashik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3912">There were two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="3913">And his brothers also was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, so he came in and he said to me, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="3914">There is somebody who wants to sell a revolver. </sentence><sentence id="3915">You want to buy it?" </sentence><sentence id="3916">I said, "Sure, Fred." </sentence><sentence id="3917">Because I was ready to buy. " </sentence><sentence id="3918">Go and buy it." </sentence><sentence id="3919">And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, "He doesn't want money. </sentence><sentence id="3920">He wants to have a suit or two suits." </sentence><sentence id="3921">I said, "No problem. </sentence><sentence id="3922">I have two <span class="spatial object">suits</span> still left by somebody in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3923">I will send for it, and I will give him. </sentence><sentence id="3924">Bring me the revolver." </sentence><sentence id="3925">He went. </sentence><sentence id="3926">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="3927">He said, "Oh, he's not <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3928">And when he came in, I saw him holding the hand in his right pocket. </sentence><sentence id="3929">And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not boots, shoes and short, half shoes. </sentence><sentence id="3930">And I didn't need in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> . </sentence><sentence id="3931">I said to him, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="3932">I have those shoes," and I dragged them, "I don't need. </sentence><sentence id="3933">It's the same size as you. </sentence><sentence id="3934">Why don't you take the shoes?" </sentence><sentence id="3935">So he went and he opened the <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> with the left hand. </sentence><sentence id="3936">And his hand was filled in the <span class="spatial object">pack</span>...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3937">Then I asked him...he used to be contributor to the <span class="building">Polish underground newspaper</span> and every Tuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday. </sentence><sentence id="3938">I asked him, "Tell me, Yasha, today the newspaper came out. </sentence><sentence id="3939">What is there news." </sentence><sentence id="3940">Because from the <span class="building">underground newspaper</span>, we could find out more than from the German newspaper. " </sentence><sentence id="3941">What is the news." </sentence><sentence id="3942">He said, "I forgot." </sentence><sentence id="3943">To me, it was something. </sentence><sentence id="3944">He is a contributor and I ask him about the news, but he says I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="3945">He opens the <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> with the left hand. </sentence><sentence id="3946">He doesn't take...so intuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a military blanket because we want to rest. </sentence><sentence id="3947">Something told me and I lifted up the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span> and I took out my revolver. </sentence><sentence id="3948">I always had my revolver with me even if I slept. </sentence><sentence id="3949">I had a belt, and on the belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had around me. </sentence><sentence id="3950">So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel revolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver. </sentence><sentence id="3951">I held it straight to him. </sentence><sentence id="3952">In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in the <span class="spatial object">package</span>, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="3953">He wanted to go down. </sentence><sentence id="3954">He opened the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3955">And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him. </sentence><sentence id="3956">The minute he saw it he walked out. </sentence><sentence id="3957">Then I said to my brother, "What did you do?" </sentence><sentence id="3958">And he couldn't...he said to me, "Why didn't you trust them. </sentence><sentence id="3959">Those are people want to save us." " </sentence><sentence id="3960">Well, it was done. </sentence><sentence id="3961">It's too late." </sentence><sentence id="3962">About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3963">Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3964">Because this was near the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and on the <span class="dlf">road</span> was a German patrol. </sentence><sentence id="3965">So they had to let them and this later we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="3966">But we didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3967">But when he saw me ready, he walked out. </sentence><sentence id="3968">The next day we didn't know what to do, how to face them. </sentence><sentence id="3969">We were embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="3970">But they didn't mention anything. </sentence><sentence id="3971">I didn't mention anything. </sentence><sentence id="3972">They went to <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3973">He brought me  7 medicine. </sentence><sentence id="3974">He brought me this. </sentence><sentence id="3975">About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German newspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is. </sentence><sentence id="3976">We looked, we had a little <span class="spatial object">kerosene lamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3977">My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper and he said to me, "Well, I lost something. </sentence><sentence id="3978">Why don't you lend me your flashlight." </sentence><sentence id="3979">I took off the flashlight, and I gave it to him. </sentence><sentence id="3980">Soon as I gave him the flashlight it became dark. </sentence><sentence id="3981">He turned off the <span class="spatial object">kerosene lamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3982">And as it became dark, I hear a shots. </sentence><sentence id="3983">One, two, three, four. </sentence><sentence id="3984">I didn't know what, when. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And I fell down. </sentence><sentence id="3986">I fell down. </sentence><sentence id="3987">I was [old you see??], </sentence><sentence id="3988">and my head started to spin around. </sentence><sentence id="3989">In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few seconds, a few minutes maybe. </sentence><sentence id="3990">But this took a split of a second and I fell. </sentence><sentence id="3991">And I fell down. </sentence><sentence id="3992">I said, "This is it." </sentence><sentence id="3993">They took us in to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="3994">But I'm glad that somebody shot me from behind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive. </sentence><sentence id="3995">I didn't want they should torture me. </sentence><sentence id="3996">So we always had a rule in our <span class="building">unit</span> that if the last bullet we cannot shoot, the last bullet we had to leave for ourself. </sentence><sentence id="3997">But here, I fell down. </sentence><sentence id="3998">I said, "Fine, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="3999">We went through so much. </sentence><sentence id="4000">The whole family doesn't live. </sentence><sentence id="4001">Everybody I loved doesn't live. </sentence><sentence id="4002">It's enough." </sentence><sentence id="4003">And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive. </sentence><sentence id="4004">Why should he shoot me? </sentence><sentence id="4005">Why shouldn't I kill him? </sentence><sentence id="4006">Laying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, somehow I took out my <span class="spatial object">revolver</span>, and it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence id="4007">I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through. </sentence><sentence id="4008">L..then when I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the finger apart, but didn't touch the bone. </sentence><sentence id="4009">So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't because it didn't move. </sentence><sentence id="4010">Now [i.e. today] in winter, I cannot move this finger. </sentence><sentence id="4011">In winter, it gets stiff. </sentence><sentence id="4012">But during the day 2?.. </sentence><sentence id="4013">Right away, I had enough. </sentence><sentence id="4014">I put in the other finger. </sentence><sentence id="4015">I put in this finger. </sentence><sentence id="4016">And it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="4017">I shot once in the <span class="env feature">air</span>, and I had a big caliber. </sentence><sentence id="4018">So from the shot, I could see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the <span class="dlf">doorway</span> because it was very small where they made the extension the <span class="dlf">door</span> to go in. </sentence><sentence id="4019">So I still saw him. </sentence><sentence id="4020">It went so fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me. </sentence><sentence id="4021">It went so fast. </sentence><sentence id="4022">So when I shot once, I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="4023">Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time. </sentence><sentence id="4024">By the third time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet. </sentence><sentence id="4025">When I shot him the first time I saw him already laying stretched out. </sentence><sentence id="4026">With my second bullet, one I shot in the <span class="env feature">air</span>, with the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him. </sentence><sentence id="4027">And by the third bullet, I saw him stretched out. </sentence><sentence id="4028">When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same thing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="4029">When he saw what happened he ran out. </sentence><sentence id="4030">And this was an <span class="dlf">emergency door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4031">When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the <span class="dlf">spine</span>, and he fell down. </sentence><sentence id="4032">Now we are naked. </sentence><sentence id="4033">My brother didn't know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="4034">So he started to yell to them, "What you playing with firecrackers? </sentence><sentence id="4035">Because he couldn't understand, it went so fast. </sentence><sentence id="4036">So I said to him, "No." </sentence><sentence id="4037">And we had our things on the <span class="interior space">attic</span>, and there was no <span class="dlf">ladder</span> to the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4038">But we had to climb through the <span class="dlf">beams</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4039">Took the revolver in my teeth, I started to climb and I wanted to take boots. </sentence><sentence id="4040">I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most important thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war. </sentence><sentence id="4041">And every day she wrote in the <span class="spatial object">diary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4042">But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to sit and I will enter for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="4043">So I wanted to get the <span class="spatial object">diary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4044">But in the dark, scared, you [are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit. </sentence><sentence id="4045">So when I took one boot out of the 2? </sentence><sentence id="4046">I took this and that. </sentence><sentence id="4047">I left everything. </sentence><sentence id="4048">I jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="4049">I called my brother. </sentence><sentence id="4050">He wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4051">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="4052">He find a <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4053">He ran out the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4054">And his friends, there  8 03:46: were about 6 friends waiting outside. </sentence><sentence id="4055">They grabbed him. </sentence><sentence id="4056">When I came in, I remember I stepped on this dead body. </sentence><sentence id="4057">It was so soft. </sentence><sentence id="4058">So I came in...in the <span class="dlf">openings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4059">I saw a few guys. </sentence><sentence id="4060">And I knew the guys. </sentence><sentence id="4061">They were my <span class="building">school</span> friends. </sentence><sentence id="4062">They're holding my brother. </sentence><sentence id="4063">And a few, standing...laying over this other brother was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="4064">So I was standing in the <span class="dlf">doorway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4065">I still had three bullets in my revolver, and I said to them, "If you don't let him go this minute, three of you will be killed." </sentence><sentence id="4066">I said, "I never miss. </sentence><sentence id="4067">I have three bullets left in the <span class="spatial object">revolver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4068">Three will be killed." </sentence><sentence id="4069">And the minute I said it they let him go and they run away. </sentence><sentence id="4070">I remember leven still had enough brain, I went back and I took out from the hand of this dead guy his revolver. </sentence><sentence id="4071">And I said to my brother let's run we ran, it was the 18th of January. </sentence><sentence id="4072">Two yards high snow. </sentence><sentence id="4073">All we had is our underwear. </sentence><sentence id="4074">No shoes. </sentence><sentence id="4075">Nothing! </sentence><sentence id="4076">And we run and we didn't know where. </sentence><sentence id="4077">We had to run up the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4078">We had to cross a <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4079">And in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, and this was about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="4080">In the <span class="populated place">village</span> when one dog starts to bark, all dogs bark, so you could hear not one, the whole <span class="populated place">village</span> barking. </sentence><sentence id="4081">And you could [see] lights and naturally, we are running. </sentence><sentence id="4082">We don't know where we are. </sentence><sentence id="4083">We're going up the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4084">The snow was so frozen. </sentence><sentence id="4085">From the <span class="env feature">moon</span> you could see millions of diamonds in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4086">Everything was so sparkling. </sentence><sentence id="4087">We run. </sentence><sentence id="4088">We didn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="4089">And we run, I would say about a kilometer to the first <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4090">We stopped at a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4091">I look at my brother. </sentence><sentence id="4092">My brother looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="4093">And here it was, blood running from my neck, and the blood was, we didn't know what happened because the blood from the cold, it got thick and it became clustered, but it still was running. </sentence><sentence id="4094">The hand was swollen. </sentence><sentence id="4095">We could see a <span class="dlf">trail</span> in the <span class="env feature">snow</span> from our walking from drops of bloods. </sentence><sentence id="4096">I said, "Well, if somebody will come, they will come and they will catch us." </sentence><sentence id="4097">Well, and if it's a snowy <span class="env feature">terrain</span> in the winter, you don't know where you are, because everything looks the same. </sentence><sentence id="4098">I said, "Where are we?" </sentence><sentence id="4099">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4100">This was 6 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="4101">But one thing, I knew that every 6 o'clock a <span class="spatial object">autobus</span> a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> came from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="populated place">Kolbuszova</span> at 6 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="4102">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if we would see the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> coming I will know the direction where to go." </sentence><sentence id="4103">And as I said it, we saw from a distance two reflectors from the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4104">It's not like here you have thousands of <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4105">There was only one <span class="spatial object">bus</span> that came only once a day. </sentence><sentence id="4106">And so, more or less I figured out that I will go this way and there was a <span class="building">house</span> that I knew this <span class="building">house</span>, and this peasant was friendly. </sentence><sentence id="4107">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if I would hit this <span class="building">house</span>, we would be saved." </sentence><sentence id="4108">Now imagine if peasants will see us in the middle of the winter, two people naked without shoes. </sentence><sentence id="4109">Well, anyway, we started to go down, so I had my two revolvers. </sentence><sentence id="4110">I had everything on me. </sentence><sentence id="4111">I said to my brother, "If something will happen, you should know I will open the hand grenade and we're killing each other." </sentence><sentence id="4112">He had his revolver. </sentence><sentence id="4113">And we went down and it so happens that I hit the <span class="building">house</span> I wanted to hit. </sentence><sentence id="4114">Exactly it was, this was a sure thing. </sentence><sentence id="4115">We run up here, and this <span class="building">house</span> was here. </sentence><sentence id="4116">So I had to go like this. </sentence><sentence id="4117">I hit it exactly and I knew the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4118">And from there I knew exactly how to go back to the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4119">It took me a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="4120">I reached our friends about 5 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="4121">Now on the way, we stopped...but this is not for now...I was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="4122">I didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="4123">I went to a <span class="building">doctor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4124">The doctor, you see, the doctor I went to [was from] a different <span class="region">section</span> because | didn't...and I had to go right away he shouldn't find out that something happened to those two guys. </sentence><sentence id="4125">I went to him and he checked me. </sentence><sentence id="4126">He said, "Here the bullets went through. </sentence><sentence id="4127">It was a small caliber. </sentence><sentence id="4128"> 9 By here the bullets went through. </sentence><sentence id="4129">He gave me an injection against blood poison. </sentence><sentence id="4130">I came back to our group. </sentence><sentence id="4131">The Germans heard the shots. </sentence><sentence id="4132">And this was the <span class="building">patrol</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4133">When the patrol came, they shot. </sentence><sentence id="4134">So they told them a story that bandits came. </sentence><sentence id="4135">They wanted money, and they didn't give them the money, so they shot them. </sentence><sentence id="4136">And they took it for an answer. </sentence><sentence id="4137">The next day they made a report to the police. </sentence><sentence id="4138">When the police came to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="4139">And the police didn't take this answer. </sentence><sentence id="4140">They started to search. </sentence><sentence id="4141">And they find this little <span class="interior space">room</span>, and they find the <span class="dlf">wall</span> covered with blood when I tried to climb. </sentence><sentence id="4142">And they went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and they found then my boots, they find there the...the case with the medicines, with 03:51: the instruments. </sentence><sentence id="4143">And they find my sister's diary. </sentence><sentence id="4144">And they knew it is not bandits. </sentence><sentence id="4145">And they took out the second boy, and they shot him right there. </sentence><sentence id="4146">So the second boy was also shot. </sentence><sentence id="4147">The Germans finished him off. </sentence><sentence id="4148">This was an episode. </sentence><sentence id="4149">Now this happened. </sentence><sentence id="4150">Then later it was very well known. </sentence><sentence id="4151">Then later they caught me. </sentence><sentence id="4152">They gave me poison. </sentence><sentence id="4153">This is a long story. </sentence><sentence id="4154">But this episode, I couldn't show my face. </sentence><sentence id="4155">Everybody knew about it, they gave a price on my head in the underground paper. </sentence><sentence id="4156">So once I went to a peasant to a different <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4157">And he knew that I'm Jewish because the other Jew took me over to buy something. </sentence><sentence id="4158">So he said in the papers it was that they will pay 100,000 zlotys for my head. </sentence><sentence id="4159">So he said to me, "Listen, there is that boy here." </sentence><sentence id="4160">He said the name <span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="4161">I would like to help him because I knew his father. </sentence><sentence id="4162">Maybe you know where he is. </sentence><sentence id="4163">Tell him to come to me. </sentence><sentence id="4164">I will give him bread. </sentence><sentence id="4165">I will give him butter. </sentence><sentence id="4166">I would like to help him. </sentence><sentence id="4167">I want to save this boy." </sentence><sentence id="4168">And I knew the reason why he tells me. </sentence><sentence id="4169">So I said, "Listen, if I would know where he is, I could get the 100,000 zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="4170">Why should I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="4171">I want to know myself." </sentence><sentence id="4172">He asked me about me because he wanted to make and to get this money. </sentence><sentence id="4173">So this went on for a few weeks til I joined the Ak. Well I saw I couldn't, so I joined the AK in a different <span class="region">section</span>, and I had papers and they accepted me when everything was healed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4493">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4494">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="4495">Before I left this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4496">The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah. </sentence><sentence id="4497">The Jews in 1942, they killed in our <span class="populated place">town</span> and(?) </sentence><sentence id="4498">Novasans they got together people from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> who wanted to run away to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4499">There was a place,<span class="populated place">Bokhnia</span>, that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and they went to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and <span class="country">Hungary</span> was easier to survive. </sentence><sentence id="4500">And they caught those people, they didn't catch those people. </sentence><sentence id="4501">They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm telling you this, I want to tell you about this girl. </sentence><sentence id="4502">I think she should be remembered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4513">Q: We may not have much time, so if you can condense it a little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4515">A: See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers, that they should run away to <span class="country">Romania</span>, and she was caught. </sentence><sentence id="4516">And she was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="4517">She was killed. </sentence><sentence id="4518">The Germans knew those people because they had the documents. </sentence><sentence id="4519">And they arrested those people, and they brought them to us in <span class="building">jail</span> when we were in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4520">During the night  0 I find out about it, and I went to the <span class="building">jail</span>, and through a <span class="dlf">window</span>, they told me those things what happened to them, that this girl was caught. </sentence><sentence id="4521">But there is a other list of 200 that she had to prepare documents. </sentence><sentence id="4522">They didn't know if they got the list. </sentence><sentence id="4523">But if they got the list, they will pick up the 200 too. </sentence><sentence id="4524">What was necessary is to go to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> which was 31 kilometers and go to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something and to hide. </sentence><sentence id="4525">So soon as they told me, I told... took the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> with the horse what Farding gave me to bring the old junk to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and I always had it ready packed because I never knew when I will have to go in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="4526">This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and I went officially because I had to bring those things. </sentence><sentence id="4527">So I went to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and I came into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="4528">And they are worrying about the 200 other people. </sentence><sentence id="4529">And they told me who to contact. </sentence><sentence id="4530">I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who were on the list. </sentence><sentence id="4531">But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from the 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in <span class="populated place">Novasans</span>(??). </sentence><sentence id="4532">this <span class="populated place">village</span> not far from us, they killed 400 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4533">They brought Jews from <span class="populated place">Hutta Kaminski</span> (??), </sentence><sentence id="4534">from ?? . </sentence><sentence id="4535">Young girls, beautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they took them and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="4536">Now there are so many details, but it is not for now. </sentence><sentence id="4537">But you ask me about the other details. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4561">Q: The papers </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4563">A: So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish woman, was very friendly with my father. </sentence><sentence id="4564">This was the woman I gave all the merchandise when I was left, when they took away our people to <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>, so I gave her the merchandise over the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4565">So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical. </sentence><sentence id="4566">I said, "I want to live. </sentence><sentence id="4567">I want to live. </sentence><sentence id="4568">Do something. </sentence><sentence id="4569">Do something." </sentence><sentence id="4570">She said, "What can I do." </sentence><sentence id="4571">She said, "What can I do?" </sentence><sentence id="4572">I said, "I need papers. </sentence><sentence id="4573">I want to run away." </sentence><sentence id="4574">She said, "I can help you out with it. </sentence><sentence id="4575">lam a very good friend of the Monseigneur, from the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span>...in Polish Dekan (dean). </sentence><sentence id="4576">I will ask him if he can give you papers." </sentence><sentence id="4577">So I told her, "You know, I had a friend who went with me to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4578">His name was ? . </sentence><sentence id="4579">He looked a little like me. </sentence><sentence id="4580">And he went me to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4581">And he was killed in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="4582">He was in the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="4583">He was killed. </sentence><sentence id="4584">Maybe he can give me his paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike." </sentence><sentence id="4585">She went to the <span class="building">Monseigneur</span>, and the <span class="building">Monseigneur</span> gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which they made a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="4586">And he gave me this birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="4587">With this birth certificate, I could show that that I was ? . </sentence><sentence id="4588">So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups. </sentence><sentence id="4589">So she went to the group which was farther away from my <span class="populated place">town</span> and she made a contact and with her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was very friendly with and he liked me. </sentence><sentence id="4590">He took me in, and so then I became a member of this group. </sentence><sentence id="4591">And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people who belonged to the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, and they were staying in their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4592">This was a group who was a combat group in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4593">And I was very happy to be with them because with them, we destroyed <span class="building">police stations</span>, we blew up <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4594">We did so many things because they  1 were a force. </sentence><sentence id="4595">You see when I was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> as a Jew, I only could go out when there was a blizzard, when there was a rain. </sentence><sentence id="4596">I was a fugitive. </sentence><sentence id="4597">Everybody would give me out. </sentence><sentence id="4598">I have to hide the gun. </sentence><sentence id="4599">But when I was with them, I was a hero. </sentence><sentence id="4600">I came out to the <span class="populated place">village</span> with the rifle open. </sentence><sentence id="4601">I put in a beret with a Polish eagle. </sentence><sentence id="4602">I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="4603">The girls even waited for us, to kiss us. </sentence><sentence id="4604">The people used to bring us vodka and food. </sentence><sentence id="4605">I was the same man, fighting the same enemy. </sentence><sentence id="4606">But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive. </sentence><sentence id="4607">And here because I was Pole, I was a hero. </sentence><sentence id="4608">So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take, and every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it. </sentence><sentence id="4609">And with them I had the opportunity to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4610">03:59 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4659">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4660">We're going to have to change tapes and make a decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4663">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4664">But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, I would like to tell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4667">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4669"> End of Tape #3  2 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4671">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4672">The tape is started. </sentence><sentence id="4673">You wanted to take us back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4677">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="4678">I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> with our Jewish group. </sentence><sentence id="4679">Now, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this profession. </sentence><sentence id="4680">Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized in artificial raising [of] fish. </sentence><sentence id="4681">He had artificial <span class="env feature">lakes</span>...not artificial...had man made <span class="env feature">lakes</span>, and they raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> and his name was Bank, and the forester's name was Pinya. </sentence><sentence id="4682">Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was the organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader. </sentence><sentence id="4683">Then later he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="4684">Uh...He could be saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the <span class="building">house</span> were peasants from his <span class="populated place">village</span>, and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends. </sentence><sentence id="4685">They were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them. </sentence><sentence id="4686">But nevertheless, they took him with his wife, and they took him to a <span class="building">barn</span> and they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="4687">After this I became, I took over his place, and I became the leader. </sentence><sentence id="4688">Now, we wanted to do something against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4689">It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves from the Poles who were so hostile towards us. </sentence><sentence id="4690">There was, as I told you before, the Poles used to get skim milk for free, but there was a <span class="building">factory</span> not far from the <span class="env feature">woods</span> when in, a <span class="building">milk factory</span>, and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter, and this was sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4691">And from the whole <span class="region">section</span>, all the Poles used to bring their milk there. </sentence><sentence id="4692">So we thought that we want to disrupt these things. </sentence><sentence id="4693">I had there a man that I knew, and he was working there. </sentence><sentence id="4694">And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops, who is the guard, and how. </sentence><sentence id="4695">So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the guard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole place. </sentence><sentence id="4696">It took us about an hour. </sentence><sentence id="4697">We broke all the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and all the machines where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="4698">After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we had it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left. </sentence><sentence id="4699">The next day the Germans came and they surrounded the <span class="populated place">village</span>, and they arrested some Poles. </sentence><sentence id="4700">They accused them that they did some sabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they didn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage. </sentence><sentence id="4701">And it was quite a big damage. </sentence><sentence id="4702">It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to give the milk. </sentence><sentence id="4703">They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a <span class="building">facility</span> to manufacture the cheese and the butter. </sentence><sentence id="4704">But then later, they rebuilt it and it by them 3 months and they started again. </sentence><sentence id="4705">But this was a very big satisfaction what we did. </sentence><sentence id="4706">Also, once a week they collected the cows from the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="4707">Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring on the calf, and this was registered. </sentence><sentence id="4708">And eventually they had to give over the cow to the Germans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the cow. </sentence><sentence id="4709">They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> so we always waited when they were taken to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> they chased...not by <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, but on foot. </sentence><sentence id="4710">So we waited on the edge of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and we lured always one or two or three cows into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and we took them away. </sentence><sentence id="4711">So this was a very big help  3 for us because in the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we had meat enough for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4712">So this was also a way of trying to do some damage. </sentence><sentence id="4713">And, there was an other case that we were in a place that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews anymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4714">And we were in the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the <span class="interior space">attic</span>, but they didn't find us, and they left the <span class="building">house</span> and they took the owner from this place that we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="4715">He didn't know we were there. </sentence><sentence id="4716">And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to take him back. </sentence><sentence id="4717">And we saw it, so we waited for him outside, and we killed him. </sentence><sentence id="4718">We took away his gun, his rifle, his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4719">So those were things that we tried to do as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="4720">But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly more loyal, in the <span class="populated place">village</span> they were open and they could do a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="4721">They were very strong. </sentence><sentence id="4722">They received drops from <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, ammunition, money, medicine, and guns, everything, from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4723">They used to drop in special assigned places in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and they had all those things. </sentence><sentence id="4724">So we did other things like there was a <span class="building">police station</span> in <span class="populated place">Glogel</span> for instance. </sentence><sentence id="4725">So we surrounded the <span class="building">police station</span> one night and we disarmed the policemen. </sentence><sentence id="4726">They were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers. </sentence><sentence id="4727">We took it away, and we completely demolished the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4728">Then there was a very important <span class="dlf">railroad line</span> which went from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="populated place">Senjisuv</span> (??). </sentence><sentence id="4729">This was not far from the <span class="env feature">forest</span> what I described you before. </sentence><sentence id="4730">So a few times those <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span> were blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the Germans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the <span class="region">eastern part</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4731">And the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times, those <span class="dlf">railroad lines</span>, which was easy to do because the <span class="dlf">railroad lines</span> were not actually guarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants. </sentence><sentence id="4732">There was once an <span class="building">ammunition dump</span> and not far from <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>...before <span class="populated place">Rzeszow</span>...were big <span class="env feature">forest</span>, dense <span class="env feature">forests</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4733">So once we went over there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one <span class="building">ammunition depot</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="4734">The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same night we disappeared in the other <span class="region">section</span> and actually, they didn't catch nobody. </sentence><sentence id="4735">But they retaliated towards the local population. </sentence><sentence id="4736">They didn't know exactly who did it. </sentence><sentence id="4737">Now one episode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own. </sentence><sentence id="4738">But I have to go back to that <span class="populated place">camp</span> where we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our <span class="populated place">town</span> when we were in this <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span> when we destroyed the <span class="building">houses</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4739">So we were working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his adjudant, his helper. </sentence><sentence id="4740">And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he killed and he beat and always he was always drunk. </sentence><sentence id="4741">He always was red in his face and nose was like...from a drunkard. </sentence><sentence id="4742">And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened that I loaded in this time some <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4743">And I had a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> in my hand, a big large <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4744">He said to me, "Look in this <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>." </sentence><sentence id="4745">So I looked in his <span class="interior space">mirror</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4746">He said, "Look what good cannon fodder you are, because this what you will be." </sentence><sentence id="4747">And I didn't answer, because you couldn't answer this man. </sentence><sentence id="4748">And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="4749">His name was Motek Weiss. </sentence><sentence id="4750">He was from <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>, a very nice boy, fragile boy. </sentence><sentence id="4751">And  4 he said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring <span class="populated place">village</span> and he said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy. </sentence><sentence id="4752">And he started to beat him. </sentence><sentence id="4753">He fell down. </sentence><sentence id="4754">We put him on his feet. </sentence><sentence id="4755">He beat him again. </sentence><sentence id="4756">And he beat him so that he just was a piece of black flesh lying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4757">And later we brought him back to our <span class="building">barracks</span>, and the same day he died. </sentence><sentence id="4758">And just he did it for fun. </sentence><sentence id="4759">Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with him. </sentence><sentence id="4760">So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't say anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass. </sentence><sentence id="4761">He needs brass. </sentence><sentence id="4762">And we had brass from the old <span class="building">houses</span>, from old <span class="spatial object">candlesticks</span>, and in one <span class="interior space">room</span> in this <span class="building">warehouse</span> we kept only brass. </sentence><sentence id="4763">I took him to show him the brass. </sentence><sentence id="4764">While we went there to see the brass, we went through a <span class="interior space">room</span> where there was paper collected. </sentence><sentence id="4765">Now they were mostly old books. </sentence><sentence id="4766">You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books. </sentence><sentence id="4767"><span class="spatial object">Books</span> were always saved. </sentence><sentence id="4768">We put them on the <span class="interior space">attic</span> of the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and if it was full, so we took the books into the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human beings. </sentence><sentence id="4769">So in this time when we cleaned out the <span class="interior space">attic</span> from the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, there was full of old books. </sentence><sentence id="4770"><span class="spatial object">Books</span> that were hundred, two hundred years old. </sentence><sentence id="4771">They were yelllow. </sentence><sentence id="4772">We piled them (up). </sentence><sentence id="4773">We put them in this <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4774">It was <span class="spatial object">stacks</span> till the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4775">And he came in and he start, he always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here. </sentence><sentence id="4776">I told him paper, books. " </sentence><sentence id="4777">What kind of books?" </sentence><sentence id="4778">I told him, "Religious books. </sentence><sentence id="4779">Jewish books." </sentence><sentence id="4780">And the books were stacked on both sides of the <span class="interior space">room</span> that in the middle was just a <span class="dlf">passageway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4781">And from the top there was a little <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4782">And the <span class="dlf">window</span>, through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, rays of the sun came in. </sentence><sentence id="4783">And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the ray illuminated the dust that you could see through this <span class="dlf">window</span> came like a column of light on the one spot. </sentence><sentence id="4784">And in this moment, it reminded me that this <span class="spatial object">column</span> is the same <span class="spatial object">column</span> as God showed to the Israelites when they left <span class="country">Egypt</span> so they should know their way in the <span class="env feature">desert</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4785">So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust. </sentence><sentence id="4786">And this was to show them the way how to go. </sentence><sentence id="4787">So in this moment, I remembered from the Bible, and I said, "This is the same <span class="spatial object">column</span> as God had it when the Israelites left <span class="country">Egypt</span>." </sentence><sentence id="4788">And this Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw the spot from the ray on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and he stood in the spot and he looked up and he started to yell with his hoarse voice. </sentence><sentence id="4789">And he said, "<span class="populated place">Yehovah</span>, <span class="populated place">Yehovah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4790">Wo bist Du." </sentence><sentence id="4791">Means, "<span class="populated place">Yehovah</span>, <span class="populated place">Yehovah</span>, Where are you? </sentence><sentence id="4792">Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?."Yehovah, why don't you help your children?" </sentence><sentence id="4793">And he looked at me, and he said to me, "You see, Your Yehovah is old. </sentence><sentence id="4794">Your Yehovah is dead. </sentence><sentence id="4795">He cannot even hear what I am saying. </sentence><sentence id="4796">Now, here you are. </sentence><sentence id="4797">What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="4798">And he spat on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and he walked out. </sentence><sentence id="4799">In this moment, I was sure that God would punish him. </sentence><sentence id="4800">That God will make him lame or something will kill him. </sentence><sentence id="4801">After all, he said something bad about my God. </sentence><sentence id="4802">Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I think I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God. </sentence><sentence id="4803">But he was a stranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry. </sentence><sentence id="4804">And I said to myself, "I have to survive the war. </sentence><sentence id="4805">Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God." </sentence><sentence id="4806">This was in this time when I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4807">Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could never happen. </sentence><sentence id="4808">How could I do it? </sentence><sentence id="4809">But..still I had in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="4810">Two years later...was it two years later?...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, I found out that this man., </sentence><sentence id="4811">this <span class="building">Sharfuehrer</span>, is in charge of <span class="dlf">Polish farms</span> in the <span class="region">section</span> where it was  5 <span class="populated place">Przeworsk</span> (?). </sentence><sentence id="4812"><span class="populated place">Przeworsk</span>, the <span class="region">section</span> I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in charge of the <span class="dlf">farms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4813">Because they didn't want to have Poles in this <span class="region">section</span>, so they chased out all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, <span class="spatial object">V-2 rockets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4814">But they wanted to have something from the <span class="dlf">farms</span>, so the farmers used to go over there to work, and at night they went away. </sentence><sentence id="4815">And he was in charge of it. </sentence><sentence id="4816">And I found out about it, and I was told also that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing cards, dancing in the <span class="building">substation</span> from this <span class="populated place">Przeworsk camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4817">Now we had in our group two Jews who came from this <span class="region">vicinity</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4818">One was a manager in an estate, which knew very well the <span class="populated place">village</span> and there was another one from this vicinity. </sentence><sentence id="4819">And also the father of the girl who helped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora. </sentence><sentence id="4820">She married later and her married...marriage name is Bargike . </sentence><sentence id="4821">She lives now in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and 2 years ago I brought her over for a visit. </sentence><sentence id="4822">So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the <span class="building">house</span> where they had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="4823">And he was like a worker there. </sentence><sentence id="4824">He took care of the horses. </sentence><sentence id="4825">He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on all those things on this <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4826">And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be done. </sentence><sentence id="4827">And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that I had to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, "We cannot do it. </sentence><sentence id="4828">We're not strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed." </sentence><sentence id="4829">And I gave up the idea. </sentence><sentence id="4830">When I left the <span class="spatial object">AK</span> and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora, that he works there and this man is still there in charge. </sentence><sentence id="4831">Then I find out that not far from us there was a group of Russian partisans. </sentence><sentence id="4832">You see, the front came closer to us, so also the partisans came closer to us. </sentence><sentence id="4833">I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I introduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group. </sentence><sentence id="4834">I didn't tell them that we were Jews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the Russians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also. </sentence><sentence id="4835">And so | didn't say that we were Jews, but we were group and I have an idea that I want they should help us. </sentence><sentence id="4836">And I told them that I want to make a raid on 04:18: this <span class="building">substation</span>, and I explained to him why and that this man is there in charge. </sentence><sentence id="4837">He was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="4838">He killed a lot of people, and we can have a good job killing SS men. </sentence><sentence id="4839">And the head, the commandant of this group liked the idea, and it took us about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4840">He gave me two from his group, and I went over with...with them at night to see the <span class="dlf">roads</span>, to see the topography, and to have the preparations how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4841">And when we came back, we picked out a dark night and we had all the information from this <span class="building">Jan Hodora</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4842">Him I told what we're going to do. </sentence><sentence id="4843">I wasn't afraid that he would betray us because this was against the Germans, and he hated the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4844">And this night, it was a Saturday night, we didn't have horses. </sentence><sentence id="4845">They had horses. </sentence><sentence id="4846">So I took from my group, I took five people. </sentence><sentence id="4847">And they gave us 15 people and 5 of them took us as passengers on their horses, and everything was planned and we came over. </sentence><sentence id="4848">Now five of us wore German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="4849">I wore a German uniform, and four from the Russian partisans, and they gave me a submachine guns for us, and we came to the place. </sentence><sentence id="4850">And we cut the telephone wires, and we sneaked through the front, they were illuminated, the <span class="dlf">windows</span> where they were sitting, playing, dancing. </sentence><sentence id="4851">They had girls. </sentence><sentence id="4852">And we started to  6 throw in grenades through the <span class="dlf">front windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4853">And meanwhile, the other people came from both <span class="region">sides</span> and from the rear. </sentence><sentence id="4854">Now in the beginning it was a resistance. </sentence><sentence id="4855">They started to shoot back from <span class="spatial object">revolvers</span> because they didn't expect something like this. </sentence><sentence id="4856">And later their firing got less and less and after it stopped, we burned the <span class="building">house</span> where they were, and then later we took away the horses. </sentence><sentence id="4857">They had horses. </sentence><sentence id="4858">There was a <span class="spatial object">car</span> in the front, and there were a few <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4859">We burned the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4860">We burned the <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4861">We took the horses, and we left. </sentence><sentence id="4862">Not one of them, we estimated that were about 35 SS men in this time. </sentence><sentence id="4863">When we looked in the <span class="dlf">windows</span>, more or less we estimated so many, not one escaped. </sentence><sentence id="4864">Because it was such a surprise attack. </sentence><sentence id="4865">And from us, we came back. </sentence><sentence id="4866">All of us came back and nothing happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="4867">Now when we came back and it was a wonderful feeling when I was there, and they gave me a submachine gun and I could shoot and shoot and shoot and I didn't feel anymore in this time like a fugitive. </sentence><sentence id="4868">I felt very, very good about myself, but we knew that something will happen that they would be seeking reprisals. </sentence><sentence id="4869">Right away the Russian group left. </sentence><sentence id="4870">They went to an other place. </sentence><sentence id="4871">They went more <span class="region">north</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4872">We disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="4873">We were in this time...our group...with the five...we disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="4874">The next day the Germans came and they knew that this Russian group, Russian partisan group did it, and they surrounded the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and they searched and searched, but they didn't find nobody. </sentence><sentence id="4875">They didn't suspect the native Poles of helping us, so this was a very good feeling to do something now in this time and when I came back, so I said to myself I didn't do it so much for myself as I did it for insulting my God and this was a very, very good feeling. </sentence><sentence id="4876">Then later the rumors, not the rumors, the talk between the people, they told the story that this guy was killed in this raid, which we saw him through the <span class="dlf">window</span> anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4877">But he was well known also. </sentence><sentence id="4878">Also this Scharfuehrer, who was so vicious, he also spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="4879">For this reason, if they were like mixtures, they were even more vicious. </sentence><sentence id="4880">And the reason they used him because he spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="4881">He could hire the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="4882">He could work with them. </sentence><sentence id="4883">They should work in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, and he was in charge of this. </sentence><sentence id="4884">So those were the things that we did that it was very gratifying. </sentence><sentence id="4885">We wanted to do more, but we were hampered by the Polish population. </sentence><sentence id="4886">And I have to tell you what happened the last night. </sentence><sentence id="4887">This was the last night before the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="4888">Now people ask you survived; it's a miracle or you are lucky or something. </sentence><sentence id="4889">A thousand times you could be lucky. </sentence><sentence id="4890">Somehow you outwitted the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4891">Sometimes you made the right decision. </sentence><sentence id="4892">Instead to go left, you went right. </sentence><sentence id="4893">You had to be quick. </sentence><sentence id="4894">But if one time it didn't work, you didn't have a second chance. </sentence><sentence id="4895">The one time didn't work and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="4896">Now we don't know from all the people who were hiding and hiding and how many times they did things to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4897">We don't know because they are not here to tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="4898">Now, if I will not be here now from the whole group that we were, hundred twenty five people, from the whole group when we were liberated, only six were alive, from the hundred twenty five. </sentence><sentence id="4899">And the rest were killed, very few by the Germans, mostly were killed by the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="4900">Because the Germans didn't venture into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4901">And mostly by the end six were alive. </sentence><sentence id="4902">Now from the  7 six, two from my people before the war, they were Rabbinical students and they were very nice boys and they were very capable, went back to our <span class="populated place">town</span>, to <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa</span>, because they said we are now free. </sentence><sentence id="4903">We are liberated. </sentence><sentence id="4904">We'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="4905">We'll be considered heroes. </sentence><sentence id="4906">We survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="4907">So they went back 3 days after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="4908">Two were very prominent people from my <span class="populated place">town</span> Poles, one was a Director of Internal Revenue. </sentence><sentence id="4909">His name was Kissel. </sentence><sentence id="4910">The other one had a <span class="building">bus company</span>...had <span class="spatial object">buses</span> going. </sentence><sentence id="4911">His name was Shilenski. </sentence><sentence id="4912">Took them to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="4913">Three days after the liberation! </sentence><sentence id="4914">So imagine going through so much, going through <span class="populated place">camps</span> and <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, losing the whole family, starvation, and torture, being 2 years in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and somehow they made it. </sentence><sentence id="4915">They survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="4916">And the Germans were gone. </sentence><sentence id="4917">Here we are. </sentence><sentence id="4918">There is already liberty. </sentence><sentence id="4919">Now the Poles supposed to be our......we lived with them for thousand years. </sentence><sentence id="4920">Now they took the two boys and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="4921">Why I will never know. </sentence><sentence id="4922">Why? </sentence><sentence id="4923">What did they harm somebody? </sentence><sentence id="4924">And they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="4925">So from all our group, there were four left. </sentence><sentence id="4926">My brother and I and two brothers who were also from the <span class="populated place">village</span>, and they survived. </sentence><sentence id="4927">Six months later, one of them was poisoned so he died. </sentence><sentence id="4928">My brother died here about 15 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="4929">The second brother went to <span class="country">Israel</span> and he died there. </sentence><sentence id="4930">So I'm the only one who survived from the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="4931">Now I have to speak in the name of all of them because nobody can tell any stories. </sentence><sentence id="4932">They are dead. </sentence><sentence id="4933">So my responsibility is to tell their stories. </sentence><sentence id="4934">Now I'm preparing episodes of everybody, the circumstances how he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="4935">And I remember more or less about everyone who was killed, how he was killed and when and by whom. </sentence><sentence id="4936">So I'm preparing stories for each one how he was killed from the hundred twenty six people. </sentence><sentence id="4937">Looking back on all those things, we cannot understand how a people like Polish people could do a thing like this. </sentence><sentence id="4938">I want to tell you then the last night and I went through so many things. </sentence><sentence id="4939">I didn't tell you how I was poisoned because there is not too much time about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5208">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="5209">No. </sentence><sentence id="5210">No. </sentence><sentence id="5211">Let's hear how you were poisoned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5216">A: So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night. </sentence><sentence id="5217">If we will have time, we'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="5218">The last night I was back with my with my group. </sentence><sentence id="5219">There were only six left of us. </sentence><sentence id="5220">So I went to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was...So I went to see how the situation is. </sentence><sentence id="5221">Because the front was already by us. </sentence><sentence id="5222">The Germans went back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and came closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="5223">When we came to <span class="populated place">Hodora</span> that night nobody was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5224">The <span class="building">house</span> was empty. </sentence><sentence id="5225">It was open. </sentence><sentence id="5226">It was empty. </sentence><sentence id="5227">The cows were not there. </sentence><sentence id="5228">So we understood. </sentence><sentence id="5229">Because they are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> because to be safer. </sentence><sentence id="5230">Nobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what to do. </sentence><sentence id="5231">Now there was in the <span class="building">barn</span> was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the hay. </sentence><sentence id="5232">During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and the  <span class="dlf">8 road</span> was very close to the <span class="building">house</span> because you could hear horses, the chains ringing. </sentence><sentence id="5233">And then a few came in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> and they came into the <span class="building">barn</span> where we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="5234">And they started to take out hay for the horses. </sentence><sentence id="5235">Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out because if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the <span class="building">barn</span>, and then later we'll be exposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more. </sentence><sentence id="5236">Then later we heard them speaking that this night they will go. </sentence><sentence id="5237">Then later we came out and they were already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, "We cannot stay here because this is the <span class="region">territory</span> that the <span class="region">German front</span> is establishing. </sentence><sentence id="5238">We have to go over to the <span class="region">east</span> and to cross over probably the Russians are on the side." </sentence><sentence id="5239">So we went to a place where there was a <span class="dlf">clearing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5240">This side the Germans were, and the other side the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="5241">And we were...this was a <span class="dlf">clearing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5242">So I said, "We have to move through the <span class="dlf">clearing</span>." </sentence><sentence id="5243">So he found a little <span class="env feature">brook</span> and with this <span class="env feature">brook</span> we started to crawl to go over to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="5244">But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us from both sides. </sentence><sentence id="5245">You see when one <span class="region">side</span> started to shoot, so the other <span class="region">side</span> started to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="5246">So we knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle. </sentence><sentence id="5247">We jumped out from this little <span class="env feature">brook</span> and they were <span class="spatial object">haystacks</span> and we buried ourselves in the <span class="spatial object">haystacks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5248">Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about 200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> to the other. </sentence><sentence id="5249">Now this man, he was from a <span class="populated place">village</span>, and he said to me, "I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because they know me. </sentence><sentence id="5250">But they don't know you. </sentence><sentence id="5251">Go and ask them. </sentence><sentence id="5252">And I know those peasants." </sentence><sentence id="5253">He even told me the name. </sentence><sentence id="5254">His name is Poslusne. </sentence><sentence id="5255">He said, "I know them because they are from my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5256">I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the <span class="populated place">village</span>." </sentence><sentence id="5257">And he recognized. </sentence><sentence id="5258">Well, I thought he knows. </sentence><sentence id="5259">I came out from the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> and I run after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne. </sentence><sentence id="5260">And this was at night and they, finally, they heard me. </sentence><sentence id="5261">And they slowed down. </sentence><sentence id="5262">When they slowed I came closer to them. </sentence><sentence id="5263">Now I saw it wasn't <span class="populated place">Poslusne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5264">It was two SS man, on one horse. </sentence><sentence id="5265">And this was from this unit of the horses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other <span class="region">side</span> to find out what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="5266">Here I'm standing there close to them. </sentence><sentence id="5267">The liberation is almost here. </sentence><sentence id="5268">Freedom is almost here. </sentence><sentence id="5269">And I am standing. </sentence><sentence id="5270">And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their revolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="5271">I was barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="5272">And I had a jacket, a long jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal. </sentence><sentence id="5273">I had two revolvers, with a bayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was covered. </sentence><sentence id="5274">And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start. </sentence><sentence id="5275">I couldn't show them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="5276">So I started to yell and to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do. </sentence><sentence id="5277">My wife and my children went to the <span class="env feature">woods</span> with the cows. </sentence><sentence id="5278">Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the Russians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows. </sentence><sentence id="5279">What will I do? </sentence><sentence id="5280">What will I do? </sentence><sentence id="5281">Please help me. </sentence><sentence id="5282">Help me. </sentence><sentence id="5283">And I said to them, "We are four or five years with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="5284">Nothing happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="5285">04:31:  9 Now the Russians are coming, and there are so many rumors. </sentence><sentence id="5286">And then I figured I'm yelling to them. </sentence><sentence id="5287">I'm crying, but they don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="5288">They are Germans. </sentence><sentence id="5289">Then one of them started to translate in German to the other one what I am saying. </sentence><sentence id="5290">You see, you say luck, you say miracles. </sentence><sentence id="5291">Everything had to be, otherwise... So he started to translate. </sentence><sentence id="5292">When I see that he's translating, so I started to yell a little louder and cry a little more and tell him a little story because he understood. </sentence><sentence id="5293">And then he stopped me and he spoke to me in a very, very broken Polish. </sentence><sentence id="5294">Probably he was from <span class="region">Silesia</span>, from <span class="populated place">Posen</span>, something. </sentence><sentence id="5295">So he in very broken Polish, he ask me if I am from this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5296">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="5297">So he said to the other one in German, which I understood, he said, "Good, we don't have to go to the other <span class="region">side</span>," because they were afraid to go deeper because they will be killed because they knew the Russians are there. </sentence><sentence id="5298">So he said, "We will take him to our commandant, and let him question him. </sentence><sentence id="5299">Maybe he can give us the information we want to know. </sentence><sentence id="5300">So he told me in Polish not to worry. </sentence><sentence id="5301">They will take me for questioning and then later they will go with me to find my wife and the children. </sentence><sentence id="5302">Well, he said it. </sentence><sentence id="5303">So then they said to me to go in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="5304">And I went in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="5305">And they both put back their revolvers. </sentence><sentence id="5306">And they had rifles on their back and they climbed on their horse. </sentence><sentence id="5307">They went back on the <span class="spatial object">horse</span> and I started to walk slowly in front of them and they behind me. </sentence><sentence id="5308">Now I started to realize, ...here the whole war I went through. </sentence><sentence id="5309">Here the liberation coming. </sentence><sentence id="5310">Now I have to be shot, because if they will take me over there. </sentence><sentence id="5311">Now listen, if they will open my vest, they will see. </sentence><sentence id="5312">How can I survive? </sentence><sentence id="5313">So what...what should I do? </sentence><sentence id="5314">I have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="5315">I always 04:33 had a long barrel revolver in my belt. </sentence><sentence id="5316">I never had it in my <span class="spatial object">holster</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5317">I had it always ready. </sentence><sentence id="5318">So by going in the front so a little, I put in my hand and I cocked the revolver. </sentence><sentence id="5319">I pulled it out slowly, and suddenly I turned around. </sentence><sentence id="5320">In a split second I emptied it and I shot seven bullets in them and they fell down dead from the horse. </sentence><sentence id="5321">Because I knew I had to. </sentence><sentence id="5322">And they fell down. </sentence><sentence id="5323">The minute I started to shoot on them so bullets, millions of bullets from both sides came in my direction because the Germans were here. </sentence><sentence id="5324">The Russians were here. </sentence><sentence id="5325">They didn't know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="5326">So they started to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="5327">So I took the horse as a shield and I started to walk slowly toward the <span class="region">Russian side</span>, and I call...yal...1 bent down, and first thing I took out the revolvers again. </sentence><sentence id="5328">This was very important. </sentence><sentence id="5329">I put them in my <span class="spatial object">belt</span> to take away, and I went to the side from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="5330">I was about hundred feet away from the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5331">A few jumped out and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands. </sentence><sentence id="5332">So they spoke to me in Russian. </sentence><sentence id="5333">I was very relieved and I came in and they asked me what happened. </sentence><sentence id="5334">So I told them what happened, that the two Germans and I shot them and the revolvers. </sentence><sentence id="5335">First thing they relieved me...they took away everything I had, and they said, "Let's wait til our commandant comes." </sentence><sentence id="5336">About a half a hour later, the commandant came, a young fellow on a horse and he asked me, so I told him. </sentence><sentence id="5337">He asked me, "Who are you." </sentence><sentence id="5338">I said to him, "I have a group of partisans in the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5339">Again I didn't say Polish or Jewish because you never knew because even then they killed a lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="5340">And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian or Russians, so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in <span class="country">Russia</span> a few months. </sentence><sentence id="5341">He was very surprised that I speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="5342">So when I told him the whole story except , first they  0 took the horses. </sentence><sentence id="5343">Oh, I like the horse. </sentence><sentence id="5344">This will be my horse. </sentence><sentence id="5345">They took away. </sentence><sentence id="5346">So I said, "I'm going back for my group. </sentence><sentence id="5347">I have there a group about 60 people." </sentence><sentence id="5348">He said, "Don't go back to the group, because if you will come back they will probably shoot you, all of you on the way coming out from the <span class="dlf">German line</span>." </sentence><sentence id="5349">He said, "You are already here. </sentence><sentence id="5350">Stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="5351">We are...we accepting you. </sentence><sentence id="5352">We will take you in. </sentence><sentence id="5353">Come with me." </sentence><sentence id="5354">So I even told them, "When I go back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans, why don't you give me your submachine guns." </sentence><sentence id="5355">It's called in <span class="populated place">Russian papetsha</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="5356">Why don't you give me your <span class="spatial object">papetsha</span>, and I will go up and I will show them that I have met the Russians." </sentence><sentence id="5357">He said, "Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="5358">When you come back to me, you get it from me. </sentence><sentence id="5359">But to make sure, to show them that you met the Russians, he took off his hat and he took off the star with the sickle and and hammer and said, "Show them this and this will be proof enough." </sentence><sentence id="5360">And he said, "Go and bring them. </sentence><sentence id="5361">We will wait til morning for you." </sentence><sentence id="5362">He asked me, "How long will it take to bring them over." </sentence><sentence id="5363">I said, "Maybe 2 hours." </sentence><sentence id="5364">He said, "That will be enough time. </sentence><sentence id="5365">Bring them over." </sentence><sentence id="5366">Now when he told me this and when I walked away I was sure he doesn't believe me the story. </sentence><sentence id="5367">Because he was too lenient and he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="5368">Now why should I go back? </sentence><sentence id="5369">Why should I be so stupid go back to the <span class="dlf">German line</span> and bring over people? </sentence><sentence id="5370">He probably thought that I am sent out from the <span class="region">German side</span> to find out if there are people, how many, and I was sure that the minute I would turn around, when I went away, he took away my two revolvers from the two Germans but he gave me back mine. </sentence><sentence id="5371">And I was sure that I would turn around that in the <span class="interior space">back</span> I will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="5372">So when I started I walk like I was walking like on <span class="dlf">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5373">I couldn't move my legs, but I start and farther I went I was more sure for myself and when I was already about 200 feet so I figured well now maybe, I'm safe. </sentence><sentence id="5374">They will not shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="5375">And then I started to tun. </sentence><sentence id="5376">I run back to the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> where my friend was lying there. </sentence><sentence id="5377">Naturally, he grabbed me. </sentence><sentence id="5378">He kissed me. </sentence><sentence id="5379">He was sorry. </sentence><sentence id="5380">He thought that I am dead, that I'm shot. </sentence><sentence id="5381">He didn't know that I killed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="5382">So I said, "Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="5383">This is not for us." </sentence><sentence id="5384">So we went the same way and we went where the two Germans were laying dead. </sentence><sentence id="5385">So going through...so then we helped ourselves to their two rifles because...we took off the two rifles, and we went over the other side. </sentence><sentence id="5386">We went there to a <span class="building">peasant hut</span>, and we were waiting there a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="5387">In the morning somebody opened the <span class="dlf">barn door</span> and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="5388">He wanted to milk a cow to get some milk. </sentence><sentence id="5389">I jumped down and | asked him, "What's going on?" </sentence><sentence id="5390">He said, "Well, we liberated this <span class="populated place">village</span> this night." </sentence><sentence id="5391">I grabbed him and I hugged him and I danced around and this was my liberation. </sentence><sentence id="5392">So the reason why I told you this story, this was the last night. </sentence><sentence id="5393">Now the last night I would if 1 wouldn't have the quick mind to turn around to kill them or something like this, I would be dead. </sentence><sentence id="5394">It so happens that every day something else happened and every day, oh, you had to outsmart somebody or you had to be quick about something. </sentence><sentence id="5395">And this is the way that mostly survivors survived. </sentence><sentence id="5396">See, if somebody survived in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, he couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="5397">If he didn't die of typhus, and he didn't die of starvation, he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed, he survived because he didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something. </sentence><sentence id="5398">He had to be strong to wait and not to be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="5399">But when you were on your own in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> or like my wife on illegal papers, every day was a challenge. </sentence><sentence id="5400">Every day you had to do something to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="5401">Now you were asking me a question. </sentence><sentence id="5402">I didn't tell you this before. </sentence><sentence id="5403">Why do I tell all those stories? </sentence><sentence id="5404">There are people, survivors who don't want to open their mouths, and they will shut up and they don't tell because the pains come back and they cannot sleep nights. </sentence><sentence id="5405">You don't  1 sleep nights. </sentence><sentence id="5406">You dream about it. </sentence><sentence id="5407">The next day you think about it. </sentence><sentence id="5408">And this is a vicious circle. </sentence><sentence id="5409">It goes day after day after night. </sentence><sentence id="5410">I think every survivor survived for a reason. </sentence><sentence id="5411">I survived for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="5412">I had two legacies why I survived. </sentence><sentence id="5413">And this gave me strength. </sentence><sentence id="5414">One legacy was when my father was shot (I told you this before) the last words was, "Revenge, revenge, revenge. </sentence><sentence id="5415">Take revenge." </sentence><sentence id="5416">And I wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="5417">I wanted to join a special <span class="spatial object">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5418">For this reason, I joined right away the army, and I wanted to join a unit that could give me the possibility of revenge. </sentence><sentence id="5419">I took revenge as much as | could. </sentence><sentence id="5420">Looking back, some people say well revenge is not sweet because it doesn't bring anybody to life. </sentence><sentence id="5421">But if you will ask a person who went through so much and you will say if you have a chance to take revenge maybe not so much for me because I'm alive and this what I went through doesn't mean anything, but for the people who are not alive, the people who are killed. </sentence><sentence id="5422">And if I took revenge for my father, I did it gladly. </sentence><sentence id="5423">Now after so many years, we live in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5424">It's a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="5425">We have to live like human beings, not to be like animals. </sentence><sentence id="5426">Like in this time everybody was an animal. </sentence><sentence id="5427">This gave me strength. </sentence><sentence id="5428">The second strength gave me when my mother was taken to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5429">She somehow sent to somebody a letter to me when I was in the <span class="populated place">Kolbuszowa camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5430">And she wrote me in the letter and she said, "You are the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="5431">You are young. </sentence><sentence id="5432">You are my youngest. </sentence><sentence id="5433">You are young. </sentence><sentence id="5434">You are healthy, and you are a witness." " </sentence><sentence id="5435">So go on," and she said, "Let the thing that you are an orphan and let it not break you. </sentence><sentence id="5436">You go on and live. </sentence><sentence id="5437">Live. </sentence><sentence id="5438">Go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> and tell it to David." </sentence><sentence id="5439">David was my brother.
