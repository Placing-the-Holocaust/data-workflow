place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I think, was established in the first month, I don't remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="3">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> boundaries were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. </sentence><sentence id="4">Nobody was moving. </sentence><sentence id="5">At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from <span class="country">Latvia</span>, from <span class="populated place">Volhynia</span>, from the parts of <span class="country">Poland</span>, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the <span class="region">states</span> which <span class="country">Russia</span> occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of <span class="interior space">Jewish apartments</span> as we lived in the nice section of <span class="populated place">town</span> where one of the parents were to go. </sentence><sentence id="6">Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus F (couldn't hear) to go, so we went. </sentence><sentence id="7">We were able to get a <span class="interior space">room</span> in one of the two or three <span class="building">homes</span> which had modern conveniences like water, flush <span class="spatial object">toilets</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="8">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst <span class="populated place">slums</span> by looting. </sentence><sentence id="9">There were very few <span class="building">buildings</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was left with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="10">Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="11">But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. </sentence><sentence id="12">The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="13">This had changed in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="14">In 1942, the <span class="building">runcoston</span> had a assembly. </sentence><sentence id="15">It's 92, 50 years before and I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="16">He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized <span class="building">orphanages</span> even un <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="17">Jews over 60 years old and children under 10. </sentence><sentence id="18">He told us, you have a choice. </sentence><sentence id="19">Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse. </sentence><sentence id="20">If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. </sentence><sentence id="21">Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go. </sentence><sentence id="22">And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. </sentence><sentence id="23">Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their <span class="building">homes</span> and the Jewish police went from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. </sentence><sentence id="24">All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="25">But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came. </sentence><sentence id="26">Some people were shot. </sentence><sentence id="27">They tore the children from the mothers" arms. </sentence><sentence id="28">They beat the people. </sentence><sentence id="29">The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="30">In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away. </sentence><sentence id="31">Only when the child was already on the <span class="spatial object">horse drawn wagon</span>, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry. </sentence><sentence id="32">Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="33">And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. </sentence><sentence id="34">The food supply didn't improve -- deteriorate, more and more. </sentence><sentence id="35">There was a lot of mismanagement, in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">He tried <span class="populated place">Rumkoski</span> tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population. </sentence><sentence id="37">And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="38">In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando. </sentence><sentence id="39">He tried to bring some order to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">In a way he did. </sentence><sentence id="41">He made the thing look a little more efficient. </sentence><sentence id="42">In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in <span class="interior space">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call <span class="building">mussermench</span>, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. </sentence><sentence id="44">The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die. </sentence><sentence id="45">Well, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> lived until 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Had you heard about the <span class="populated place">camps</span> at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: <span class="populated place">Lodz ghetto</span> was the most isolated <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">Every hundred feet you get a German guard. </sentence><sentence id="123">We didn't get no papers, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="124">Supposedly, few survivors from <span class="populated place">Chedno</span> were able to escape but the population didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="125">We knew that clothes came back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had foreboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn't know that systematic extermination and this. </sentence><sentence id="126">Well, we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">There was hundred people in a <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> in which we were transported. </sentence><sentence id="128">We went for about three or four days. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="141"> (END OF <span class="dlf">SIDE A</span>) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="143">So, when we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this, and what they gave us, there was one <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> which was supposed to serve if people wanted to relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="144">There was no <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">A little bit of food we took with. </sentence><sentence id="146">I think it took us about four days out to reach <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">We came at night. </sentence><sentence id="148">We were allowed to take hand baggage. </sentence><sentence id="149">When the <span class="dlf">doors</span> opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped pajamas uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="150">But they spoke to us Polish and told us, "please leave all the things inside the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">Just get out, get out, get out." </sentence><sentence id="152">Before we could do anything else, we form a <span class="dlf">line</span>, we saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching top a well lighted <span class="dlf">platform</span> and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. </sentence><sentence id="153">And with a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. </sentence><sentence id="154">We had no idea what it means. </sentence><sentence id="155">I went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="156">They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157"><span class="building">Barrack</span> that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept over there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place to turn around. </sentence><sentence id="158">I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all bones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the <span class="env feature">wood</span> and the things got infected. </sentence><sentence id="159">I was about two weeks -- I wasn't in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I was in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160"><span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> was part of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz complex</span> but there was, people didn't work over there. </sentence><sentence id="161">People were either sent to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, either sent out to other <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="162">You could see when we went to the <span class="building">barrack</span>, the flames shooting and the block leader told us what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers. </sentence><sentence id="163">Well, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and I met one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. </sentence><sentence id="164">And we were, together, almost to the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="165">We were deported to the commander of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">That was a separate <span class="populated place">camps</span> of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167"><span class="populated place">Dachau</span> was much minor camp in comparison. . </sentence><sentence id="168">There were just <span class="populated place">camps</span> in which the Jews worked until they  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection carry the dead bodies back because they have to count every day. </sentence><sentence id="169">We stood on the <span class="dlf">appell platz</span>, that was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally, even if we stood late in the night. </sentence><sentence id="170">I was lucky for a short while to get the job . </sentence><sentence id="171">Then they used us to take care of other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="172">When you are sick, when you get your slice of bread you couldn't eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. </sentence><sentence id="173">At that time, I gained some weight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> all the sick people, the <span class="dlf">block</span> was liquidated and we went back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
