<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42"><span class="populated place">Paris</span> was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="43">And then the war ended in "45. </sentence><sentence id="44">I was still in <span class="country">France</span> and originally I had papers to come to the <span class="country">United States</span> in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span> and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war. </sentence><sentence id="45">So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired. </sentence><sentence id="46">And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the <span class="building">jail</span> and everything. </sentence><sentence id="47">But in "45, at the end of the war, I was in <span class="country">France</span> and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in <span class="populated place">Baltimore</span> sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to <span class="populated place">LeHavre</span> in <span class="country">France</span> and took the <span class="spatial object">John Erikkson</span> to the <span class="country">United State</span>, a 10 days <span class="dlf">crossing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">And I arrived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years. </sentence><sentence id="50">To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it's hardly to be believed, that's 51 years have gone by, yes. </sentence><sentence id="51">So I was in <span class="country">France</span> at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the <span class="country">United States</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="52">At that point, I didn't know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="53">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="54"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 4 that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and I knew that my mother -- hadn't heard since "42. </sentence><sentence id="55">So that was, to me, an indication. </sentence><sentence id="56">So I came to <span class="country">United States</span>, I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">France</span> where they were -- German soldiers were being led through <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: And how did you go about beginning to deal with it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: I tried to start searches. </sentence><sentence id="259"><span class="building">Red Cross</span> and other <span class="building">venues</span> and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="260">That was from "47 to "62, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book. </sentence><sentence id="261">And how I dealt at the moment? </sentence><sentence id="262">At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="263">I had received my papers to come to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there. </sentence><sentence id="265">It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, <span class="country">France</span>, beautiful <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="266"><span class="country">Countries</span> are always beautiful, it's what the people do that's not so good, often, you know. </sentence><sentence id="267">But <span class="country">France</span> to me was -- was a <span class="country">country</span> that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in <span class="building">jail</span> and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on. </sentence><sentence id="268">I -- I looked forward to coming to <span class="country">America</span>, wh-where I knew I had family This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="269">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="270"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 9 and start a new life. </sentence><sentence id="271">And that's what I was dealing with. </sentence><sentence id="272">I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in <span class="country">Europe</span> and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to <span class="building">Red Cross</span> and other <span class="building">agencies</span> and I never heard anything. </sentence><sentence id="273">And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived. </sentence><sentence id="274">So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn't advance anything from me emotionally, because I'd only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="275">And I looked forward to make a break. </sentence><sentence id="276">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="277">I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality.
