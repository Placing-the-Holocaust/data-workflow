<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Would you please tell me your name, how you were born, your birth name, and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now, my name is Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="5">It went from <span class="populated place">Belle</span> to <span class="populated place">Bernard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in a place. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was <span class="populated place">Martimorish</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="8">It's in <span class="country">Romania</span>, and the <span class="populated place">city</span> is <span class="populated place">Visho</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">In <span class="populated place">Visho</span>, when <span class="country">Romania</span> was there it was <span class="populated place">Vishosimos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">And also, they called that <span class="populated place">city</span> <span class="populated place">Feldesisho</span> because the Hungarians were there. </sentence><sentence id="11">The <span class="region">area</span> where I was born was surrounded with <span class="env feature">mountains</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had high peaks of <span class="env feature">mountains</span> over there which there was snow almost all year around. </sentence><sentence id="13">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back. </sentence><sentence id="14">The <span class="region">area</span> was a beautiful <span class="region">area</span> surrounded with <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">We had <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">We had everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="17">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="18">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="19">We all had <span class="region">areas</span>, different <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">The Jews had their <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">The Rumanians the other <span class="populated place">quarter</span>, the Germans the other <span class="region">quarter</span> and the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="22">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name. </sentence><sentence id="24">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the <span class="populated place">city</span>, in the <span class="building">Visho</span>, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the <span class="spatial object">Shobot</span> comes, three times. </sentence><sentence id="26">The first whistle meant close the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">The second whistle meant you should be <span class="building">home</span> by now, and the third one to light candles. </sentence><sentence id="28">That was the greatest thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="29">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us. </sentence><sentence id="30">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">We stored away the food for the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="32">We put it in <span class="interior space">basements</span>, whoever had <span class="interior space">basements</span> and we kept on going day by day. </sentence><sentence id="33">We had no <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="34">We had no <span class="spatial object">radios</span> and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was like in the early 1900 century. </sentence><sentence id="36">It didn't change much, the life. </sentence><sentence id="37">There was a lot of poor people in the <span class="region">area</span> also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people. </sentence><sentence id="38">The father only had the work over there. </sentence><sentence id="39">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children. </sentence><sentence id="40">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way. </sentence><sentence id="41">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there. </sentence><sentence id="42">It started with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="43">No matter what you do, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="44">You went to <span class="populated place">Hadre</span>, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="45">You walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating. </sentence><sentence id="46">You went to <span class="building">school</span> which the principal from the <span class="building">school</span>, his name was Hugar. </sentence><sentence id="47">He was standing in the <span class="dlf">steps</span> just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then we went in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately. </sentence><sentence id="50">Now, the teacher came in. </sentence><sentence id="51">When the teacher came in, you could drop a <span class="spatial object">pin</span>, and it was so quiet nobody made a move. </sentence><sentence id="52">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="53">So, that's the way life was in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty. </sentence><sentence id="55">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties. </sentence><sentence id="56">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick. </sentence><sentence id="57">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work. </sentence><sentence id="58">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm. </sentence><sentence id="59">But there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="60">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="61">It's the same thing with the food. </sentence><sentence id="62">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand. </sentence><sentence id="63">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand. </sentence><sentence id="64">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand. </sentence><sentence id="65">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a <span class="building">tin smith</span> and he only had to shear with right hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="66">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="67">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day. </sentence><sentence id="68">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="69">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="70">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="71">Life would be different. </sentence><sentence id="72">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know. </sentence><sentence id="73">This is a different type of Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="74">All right. </sentence><sentence id="75">In the beginning it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="76">A year or two or something, it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="77">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party. </sentence><sentence id="78">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar. </sentence><sentence id="79"><span class="populated place">Koozer</span> and <span class="populated place">Googar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to <span class="populated place">Visho</span> because we know they're coming to <span class="populated place">Visho</span> to make the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="81">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="82"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="83">What happened when it came to the <span class="region">area</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Visho</span> left, they turned right and they went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">They burned the whole <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">They killed a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="86">They destroyed everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="87">That was in the late thirties. </sentence><sentence id="88">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span> any more. </sentence><sentence id="89">All my schooling was four years. </sentence><sentence id="90">I could not go to <span class="building">school</span> any more due to the fact that I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="91">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father was a singer on the weddings. </sentence><sentence id="93">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">They used to call him all around the <span class="region">area</span> for <span class="country">states</span> to sing and things. </sentence><sentence id="95">He used to put words together. </sentence><sentence id="96">If he would have been here in this <span class="country">country</span> he would be the greatest man in the <span class="country">country</span> as a singer. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, which almost everybody had that thing. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had a little <span class="dlf">farm</span> there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="99">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="100">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work. </sentence><sentence id="101">So, I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="102">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work. </sentence><sentence id="104">The people who had <span class="building">stores</span> think like this. </sentence><sentence id="105">I used to get paid and go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">What was the work?Most of the work was preparation for the war. </sentence><sentence id="107">We went out to work on the volleys. </sentence><sentence id="108">We dig big <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">We put <span class="dlf">trenches</span> around the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> should not come through. </sentence><sentence id="110">The <span class="spatial object">Russian tanks</span> should not be able to come through the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">So, we worked day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="112">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years. </sentence><sentence id="114">They took away everything whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="115">If somebody had a cow, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="116">If they had a horse, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="117">They left you <span class="interior space">flat</span> with everything. </sentence><sentence id="118">The <span class="region">area</span> where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="119">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person. </sentence><sentence id="120">There was not such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: This was from what period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="246">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="247">They needed the wood and there was a <span class="building">wood factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">I worked in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> where they sawed the wood and we cleaned off, you know around the wood they had that black thing around the wood, we chopped it off to clean the wood to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood. </sentence><sentence id="249">So, it was a very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="250">We got paid very little. </sentence><sentence id="251">We got paid -- talking about child labor. </sentence><sentence id="252">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="253">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other <span class="region">parts of Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="265">Did they know about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

After, I would say in "43, we already it got very, very bad in general. </sentence><sentence id="272">Very bad for everybody for every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="273">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them. </sentence><sentence id="274">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="275">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up. </sentence><sentence id="276">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from <span class="country">Poland</span> and she wrote a letter. </sentence><sentence id="278">She was in <span class="country">Poland</span> and her husband was in <span class="populated place">Visho</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">They couldn't get together because the war started already. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="281">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="282">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="283">She wrote like this. </sentence><sentence id="284">There is that means money, is no more. </sentence><sentence id="285">It doesn't  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they had <span class="dlf">farms</span> - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time. </sentence><sentence id="286">They have them in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="287">Let's bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="288">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="289">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around. </sentence><sentence id="290">I got permission to go out of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="291">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them. </sentence><sentence id="292">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out. </sentence><sentence id="294">They put us in the <span class="dlf">line</span>, find out how many people there are and they made four <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?" </sentence><sentence id="296">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer." </sentence><sentence id="297">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the same one they were taking away. </sentence><sentence id="298">All you could see is the same thing you see there. </sentence><sentence id="299">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> for everybody and says there is water in the <span class="building">station</span> here because those days all the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were going with water, so they had to pump in the water. </sentence><sentence id="300">So, they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and go fill up with water for the rest of the people. </sentence><sentence id="301">It happened I was the one and my father was the one. </sentence><sentence id="302">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, and then my father saw a hatch on the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span>, because every <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> had a hatch probably for the . </sentence><sentence id="303">He took that so nobody should see it. </sentence><sentence id="304">We finish with the <span class="env feature">water</span>, then close the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> and we started going. </sentence><sentence id="305">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in there. </sentence><sentence id="306">Let's break the <span class="interior space">floor</span> there to make a <span class="building">facility</span>." </sentence><sentence id="307">We worked quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="308">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a <span class="building">facility</span> there to go out like a thing. </sentence><sentence id="309">Everybody was using this. </sentence><sentence id="310">We were putting something  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection remember they opened for water and after that they did not open for water. </sentence><sentence id="311">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were going so fast. </sentence><sentence id="312">Usually in those days a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Romania</span> those days was going about 30 miles an hour. </sentence><sentence id="313">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the <span class="env feature">water</span> in, the coal, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="314">It took a very long time for those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> until they reached the destination. </sentence><sentence id="315">But when we went in those <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours. </sentence><sentence id="316">We thought the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there. </sentence><sentence id="317">What difference does it make what happened to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">Now, when we arrived already in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, there was a lot of people over there came to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">People were already in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady. </sentence><sentence id="321">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="322">He said, "Give it to your mother." </sentence><sentence id="323">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="324">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this. </sentence><sentence id="325">After I find out there was . </sentence><sentence id="326">I didn't even know who that is. </sentence><sentence id="327">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things. </sentence><sentence id="328">He selected them. </sentence><sentence id="329">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="330">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">They put them in another <span class="region">area</span> for work. </sentence><sentence id="332">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work. </sentence><sentence id="333">That's what happened after. </sentence><sentence id="334">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?" </sentence><sentence id="335">And I said yes, what's going on over there? </sentence><sentence id="336">What are they doing there? </sentence><sentence id="337">He says, "They're burning people there." </sentence><sentence id="338">I said, burning people? </sentence><sentence id="339">He said yes, they call it a <span class="building">crematorium</span> and they're burning people over there. </sentence><sentence id="340">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there. </sentence><sentence id="341">This is the people who were there already. </sentence><sentence id="342">We went from there, we went in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> from there. </sentence><sentence id="343">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the <span class="interior space">corner</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="344">I took my coat and I throw it in the <span class="interior space">corner</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="345">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back. </sentence><sentence id="346">It never happened. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, then we went to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">We went in the inside where they told the people what to do, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="349">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out. </sentence><sentence id="350">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his <span class="region">jurisdiction</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians. </sentence><sentence id="352">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be. </sentence><sentence id="353">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="354">My father says to me why go over. </sentence><sentence id="355">Let's be all together. </sentence><sentence id="356">Let's go together. </sentence><sentence id="357">The people in the <span class="building">barracks</span> they were saying, why don't you let him go as a mechanic. </sentence><sentence id="358">Why -- suppose we go in another place. </sentence><sentence id="359">We could see already what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="360">Let him go over there. </sentence><sentence id="361">So finally my father says okay, go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="362">We went to another place in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> there in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">The whole thing was only a few days. </sentence><sentence id="364">We went to another place and then all those mechanics they had we got round up and we were taking by big <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to . </sentence><sentence id="365">We did not know at that time they took us to . </sentence><sentence id="366">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection figured there is the mechanics thing and there we were going to work. </sentence><sentence id="367">We arrived in . </sentence><sentence id="368">There was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> over there already prepared. </sentence><sentence id="369">You got
