<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Would you please tell me your name, how you were born, your birth name, and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now, my name is Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="5">It went from <span class="populated place">Belle</span> to <span class="populated place">Bernard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in a place. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was <span class="populated place">Martimorish</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="8">It's in <span class="country">Romania</span>, and the <span class="populated place">city</span> is <span class="populated place">Visho</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">In <span class="populated place">Visho</span>, when <span class="country">Romania</span> was there it was <span class="populated place">Vishosimos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">And also, they called that <span class="populated place">city</span> <span class="populated place">Feldesisho</span> because the Hungarians were there. </sentence><sentence id="11">The <span class="region">area</span> where I was born was surrounded with <span class="env feature">mountains</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had high peaks of <span class="env feature">mountains</span> over there which there was snow almost all year around. </sentence><sentence id="13">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back. </sentence><sentence id="14">The <span class="region">area</span> was a beautiful <span class="region">area</span> surrounded with <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">We had <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">We had everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="17">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="18">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="19">We all had <span class="region">areas</span>, different <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">The Jews had their <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">The Rumanians the other <span class="populated place">quarter</span>, the Germans the other <span class="region">quarter</span> and the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="22">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name. </sentence><sentence id="24">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the <span class="populated place">city</span>, in the <span class="building">Visho</span>, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the <span class="spatial object">Shobot</span> comes, three times. </sentence><sentence id="26">The first whistle meant close the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">The second whistle meant you should be <span class="building">home</span> by now, and the third one to light candles. </sentence><sentence id="28">That was the greatest thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="29">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had five <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">They named them number one, number three, number four and five. </sentence><sentence id="32">We also had about four or five <span class="spatial object">shulls</span>, and we all belonged to different <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">Everybody had a different way to go wherever he wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="34">We were assigned to go to <span class="building">school</span> number one which it was I would say about a half a mile. </sentence><sentence id="35">The <span class="region">area</span> there -- there was no <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> like you have over here. </sentence><sentence id="36">We walked to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">The <span class="building">school</span> wasn't so bad to walk except there were <span class="env feature">hills</span> when you got to the <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="38">Also there was another system too over there. </sentence><sentence id="39">We went to Hebrew in the morning until 9:30, from 7:00 until about 9:30. </sentence><sentence id="40">At 9:30 we went to the <span class="building">Romanian school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">We had lunch a little bit, about a half an hour, and then in the afternoon until 4:00. </sentence><sentence id="42">4:00 we went back to <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> until about 8:00. </sentence><sentence id="43">Now, what did we do over there all this time, you know, with the children when they're grown up? </sentence><sentence id="44">Industrial life, there was only how should I say, <span class="building">wood factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">We had a lot of wood. </sentence><sentence id="46">All the time, when the Hungarians were before the First World War, and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there, very great. </sentence><sentence id="47">On the beginning on the 18th century, the beginning of the 18th century, the first Jew came over from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">He settled in <span class="populated place">Martimorish</span> because there wasn't such a good life there so they kept on coming and coming. </sentence><sentence id="49">They settled. </sentence><sentence id="50">But after the Romanians took over, after the first world war, the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there. </sentence><sentence id="51">Their lives started to be very poor, but what we grew over there and the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="52">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="53"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">We stored away the food for the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="55">We put it in <span class="interior space">basements</span>, whoever had <span class="interior space">basements</span> and we kept on going day by day. </sentence><sentence id="56">We had no <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="57">We had no <span class="spatial object">radios</span> and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="58">It was like in the early 1900 century. </sentence><sentence id="59">It didn't change much, the life. </sentence><sentence id="60">There was a lot of poor people in the <span class="region">area</span> also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people. </sentence><sentence id="61">The father only had the work over there. </sentence><sentence id="62">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children. </sentence><sentence id="63">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way. </sentence><sentence id="64">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there. </sentence><sentence id="65">It started with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="66">No matter what you do, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="67">You went to <span class="populated place">Hadre</span>, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="68">You walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating. </sentence><sentence id="69">You went to <span class="building">school</span> which the principal from the <span class="building">school</span>, his name was Hugar. </sentence><sentence id="70">He was standing in the <span class="dlf">steps</span> just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="71">Then we went in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately. </sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the teacher came in. </sentence><sentence id="74">When the teacher came in, you could drop a <span class="spatial object">pin</span>, and it was so quiet nobody made a move. </sentence><sentence id="75">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, that's the way life was in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty. </sentence><sentence id="78">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties. </sentence><sentence id="79">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick. </sentence><sentence id="80">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work. </sentence><sentence id="81">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm. </sentence><sentence id="82">But there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="83">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand. </sentence><sentence id="84">It's the same thing with the food. </sentence><sentence id="85">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand. </sentence><sentence id="86">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand. </sentence><sentence id="87">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand. </sentence><sentence id="88">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a <span class="building">tin smith</span> and he only had to shear with right hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="89">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears. </sentence><sentence id="90">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day. </sentence><sentence id="91">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="92">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="93">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="94">Life would be different. </sentence><sentence id="95">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know. </sentence><sentence id="96">This is a different type of Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="97">All right. </sentence><sentence id="98">In the beginning it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="99">A year or two or something, it was not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="100">By the way, in schooling, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party. </sentence><sentence id="101">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar. </sentence><sentence id="102"><span class="populated place">Koozer</span> and <span class="populated place">Googar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to <span class="populated place">Visho</span> because we know they're coming to <span class="populated place">Visho</span> to make the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="104">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="105"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="106">What happened when it came to the <span class="region">area</span>, the <span class="spatial object">Visho</span> left, they turned right and they went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">They burned the whole <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">They killed a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="109">They destroyed everything over there. </sentence><sentence id="110">That was in the late thirties. </sentence><sentence id="111">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span> any more. </sentence><sentence id="112">All my schooling was four years. </sentence><sentence id="113">I could not go to <span class="building">school</span> any more due to the fact that I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="114">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing. </sentence><sentence id="115">My father was a singer on the weddings. </sentence><sentence id="116">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="117">They used to call him all around the <span class="region">area</span> for <span class="country">states</span> to sing and things. </sentence><sentence id="118">He used to put words together. </sentence><sentence id="119">If he would have been here in this <span class="country">country</span> he would be the greatest man in the <span class="country">country</span> as a singer. </sentence><sentence id="120">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, which almost everybody had that thing. </sentence><sentence id="121">We had a little <span class="dlf">farm</span> there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="122">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="123">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work. </sentence><sentence id="124">So, I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="125">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too. </sentence><sentence id="126">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work. </sentence><sentence id="127">The people who had <span class="building">stores</span> think like this. </sentence><sentence id="128">I used to get paid and go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">What was the work?Most of the work was preparation for the war. </sentence><sentence id="130">We went out to work on the volleys. </sentence><sentence id="131">We dig big <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">We put <span class="dlf">trenches</span> around the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> should not come through. </sentence><sentence id="133">The <span class="spatial object">Russian tanks</span> should not be able to come through the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">So, we worked day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="135">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days. </sentence><sentence id="136">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years. </sentence><sentence id="137">They took away everything whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="138">If somebody had a cow, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="139">If they had a horse, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="140">They left you <span class="interior space">flat</span> with everything. </sentence><sentence id="141">The <span class="region">area</span> where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="142">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person. </sentence><sentence id="143">There was not such a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: This was from what period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in. </sentence><sentence id="293">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="294">They needed the wood and there was a <span class="building">wood factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">I worked in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> where they sawed the wood and we cleaned off, you know around the wood they had that black thing around the wood, we chopped it off to clean the wood to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood. </sentence><sentence id="296">So, it was a very hard life. </sentence><sentence id="297">We got paid very little. </sentence><sentence id="298">We got paid -- talking about child labor. </sentence><sentence id="299">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="300">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other <span class="region">parts of Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="312">Did they know about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="316"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="317">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="318"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A. After, I would say in "43, we already it got very, very bad in general. </sentence><sentence id="319">Very bad for everybody for every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="320">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them. </sentence><sentence id="321">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="322">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up. </sentence><sentence id="323">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from <span class="country">Poland</span> and she wrote a letter. </sentence><sentence id="325">She was in <span class="country">Poland</span> and her husband was in <span class="populated place">Visho</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">They couldn't get together because the war started already. </sentence><sentence id="327">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="328">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="329">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="330">She wrote like this. </sentence><sentence id="331">There is that means money, is no more. </sentence><sentence id="332">It doesn't exit any more. </sentence><sentence id="333">So we know from that two words we started to figure out what's going on in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">There was no <span class="spatial object">radio</span> or any other communication. </sentence><sentence id="335">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="336">Later on, the situation got very bad. </sentence><sentence id="337">We heard, first of all before the state came, they called to the Army. </sentence><sentence id="338">They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time, who were 17, 18 19 to go to the <span class="building">Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">In the Army they used those Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="340">They used them to bring ammunition to the <span class="dlf">front line</span> to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army. </sentence><sentence id="341">The Army -- they had uniformed Army, they had yellow around the arms -- armband, yellow. </sentence><sentence id="342">This way they recognized them as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="343">There was also another group where they had white arm bands. </sentence><sentence id="344">That means they were not pure Jews. </sentence><sentence id="345">The mother was Jewish or the father was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="346">So, they had two type of things. </sentence><sentence id="347">I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time, my father says to me, you don't have to go, let's go together because we don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="348">He also told me something -- he told me it looks like something is going on terrible in the world. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't think you're going to be a Hungarian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="350">I think you are going to be some other place. </sentence><sentence id="351">Then, we all got together. </sentence><sentence id="352">They called us. </sentence><sentence id="353">How did they get the people together? </sentence><sentence id="354">There were <span class="spatial object">drums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">If you know when sometimes they have a <span class="spatial object">drum</span> and they bang on the <span class="spatial object">drum</span> and they got the people together, that was a sign that the whole <span class="populated place">town</span> to get together because there is some news to tell. </sentence><sentence id="356">Then they tell us that everybody there's going to be a round up and they have to go in this and this <span class="region">area</span> like but us on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">There was the <span class="dlf">Jewish street</span> and they started making the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> all around. </sentence><sentence id="358">The <span class="dlf">Jewish street</span> over there and the <span class="dlf">Romanian street</span>'s name was , the number was 25. </sentence><sentence id="359">The Hungarian name was 32. </sentence><sentence id="360">So, the reason is because I tell you this is because when they got us all together they told us which <span class="dlf">street</span> to get in together. </sentence><sentence id="361">So this was the word the guy was using to get us there. </sentence><sentence id="362">And the same thing they got all around the <span class="populated place">town</span> all around the little <span class="populated place">towns</span> and they got all these people together and they bring them in and that's <span class="dlf">street</span> around the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">We had so many people in the <span class="interior space">room</span> that there was no <span class="interior space">room</span> where to sleep or where to go or what to do anything because one was on top of the other one. </sentence><sentence id="364">The time wasn't too long in there. </sentence><sentence id="365">We was about a month in there. </sentence><sentence id="366">They were-- who was watching the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was the Hungarians and the Germans, the local people was watching in there. </sentence><sentence id="367">The food was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="368">There was no food in there. </sentence><sentence id="369">My father used to know all those big shots in there from the <span class="populated place">town</span> and he used to help a lot of people out. </sentence><sentence id="370">If they were having a problem, he used to help them out. </sentence><sentence id="371">He used to go there, so he went over to one of those guards and he said, "look we are all together in one place." </sentence><sentence id="372">Those people This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="373">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="374"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they had <span class="dlf">farms</span> - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time. </sentence><sentence id="375">They have them in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="376">Let's bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="377">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="378">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around. </sentence><sentence id="379">I got permission to go out of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="380">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them. </sentence><sentence id="381">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out. </sentence><sentence id="383">They put us in the <span class="dlf">line</span>, find out how many people there are and they made four <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?" </sentence><sentence id="385">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer." </sentence><sentence id="386">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just bypassed and to find out that information. </sentence><sentence id="387">They made like I said four <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">We had two <span class="building">stations</span> <span class="building">train stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">One <span class="building">stations</span> they called it the small <span class="building">station</span> where the <span class="spatial object">train</span> used to stop and drop off people, and the one <span class="building">station</span> was a bigger <span class="building">station</span> where the <span class="spatial object">railroad</span> came in. </sentence><sentence id="390">I also want to say that before all those things, I worked for the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="391">We took apart the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, the <span class="dlf">Romanian tracks</span>, you know from the <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="393">There was two Hungarian officers and they are not supposed to hire Jewish children for the job. </sentence><sentence id="394">When I went in there and applied for the job, he asked me the name, he asked me what your name, I said Bernard Pasternak. </sentence><sentence id="395">He said that sounds too Jewish, so he changed my name for Pasteronish. </sentence><sentence id="396">That's a real Hungarian name, and I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="397">They paid very good. </sentence><sentence id="398">We had it very good for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="399">The job only lasted for a few months because there wasn't so many <span class="dlf">tracks</span> to pick apart and we loaded them. </sentence><sentence id="400">We did not load them in the same <span class="populated place">town</span>, in <span class="populated place">Visho</span> from the same <span class="populated place">city</span>, we had to go about 50 miles away where they loaded those <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">So we went with the big <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we unloaded. </sentence><sentence id="402">That was before the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and all those things happened. </sentence><sentence id="403">We -- due to the fact they were short on <span class="spatial

id="404">When they got together everybody, they told them don't take anything, just take what you could take with you because you have on other things over there and you wouldn't need them. </sentence><sentence id="405">To that point, we didn't know what was going on -- absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="406">As a matter of fact, they told us we were going to <span class="populated place">working camps</span> until the war is over for security reasons or whatever they want. </sentence><sentence id="407">We arrived with the fourth <span class="spatial

those things what happened. </sentence><sentence id="410">People on there with small children crying throwing packets down on the Hungarian soldiers and the collaborators pulling the bags out of the family they are taking away everything. </sentence><sentence id="411">They didn't need it anyhow, but we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="412">So finally, we went in the <span class="spatial

and says there is water in the <span class="building">station</span> here because those days all the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were going with water, so they had to pump in the water. </sentence><sentence id="422">So, they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the <span class="spatial

supply water, whatever we could to the other <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, and then my father saw a hatch on the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span>, because every <span

<span class="dlf">hole</span> in there. </sentence><sentence id="428">Let's break the <span class="interior space">floor</span> there to make a <span class="building">facility</span>." </sentence><sentence id="429">We worked quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a <span class="building">facility</span> there to go out like a thing. </sentence><sentence id="431">Everybody was using this. </sentence><sentence id="432">We were putting something around there so people would have a little privacy. </sentence><sentence id="433">It took quite a few days before we got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but the middle of the way there was a few guys in the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> they told me, if you could pay attention, are we turning left or right and <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">I says to the guy, no we are turning left, he says that's bad news because right is to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, left is to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">It's the one other <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">I don't remember if it took five days or six days. </sentence><sentence id="437">When we got off in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, first of all in that time when I was taking the <span class="env feature">water</span> there was a couple of dead children already, which I took them out and there was somebody going through with a <span class="spatial

already. </sentence><sentence id="438">Nothing in there was no food, no nothing, very little things whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="439">And the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, like

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="575">You couldn't sneak out because the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was surrounded by corroborators to make sure nobody was out. </sentence><sentence id="576">And besides that, which I did not mention, you already had the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="577">You had the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing the yellow star you were finished. </sentence><sentence id="578">So, right away they know you. </sentence><sentence id="579">And I think all the things that my father knew so many of those guys and they hand picked a few of the people to go out of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> to bring in the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="580">It wasn't -- the <span

</sentence><sentence id="582">She said, "I hope you remember me." </sentence><sentence id="583">I did not know what she meant because we were so naive we didn't know what's going on until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="584">When we got off of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, first what I saw it was sickening just to see. </sentence><sentence id="585">Our <span

the coal, all those things. </sentence><sentence id="595">It took a very long time for those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> until they reached the destination. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="597">We thought the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there. </sentence><sentence id="598">What difference does it make what happened to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">Now, when we arrived already in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, there was a lot of people over there came to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">People were already in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="601">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady. </sentence><sentence id="602">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="603">He said, "Give it to your mother." </sentence><sentence id="604">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one side. </sentence><sentence id="605">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this. </sentence><sentence id="606">After I find out there was . </sentence><sentence id="607">I didn't even know who that is. </sentence><sentence id="608">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things. </sentence><sentence id="609">He selected them. </sentence><sentence id="610">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="611">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="612">They put them in another <span class="region">area</span> for work. </sentence><sentence id="613">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work. </sentence><sentence id="614">That's what happened after. </sentence><sentence id="615">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?" </sentence><sentence id="616">And I said yes, what's going on over there? </sentence><sentence id="617">What are they doing there? </sentence><sentence id="618">He says, "They're burning people there." </sentence><sentence id="619">I said, burning people? </sentence><sentence id="620">He said yes, they call it a <span class="building">crematorium</span> and they're burning people over there. </sentence><sentence id="621">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there. </sentence><sentence id="622">This is the people who were there already. </sentence><sentence id="623">We went from there, we went in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> from there. </sentence><sentence id="624">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the <span class="interior space">corner</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="625">I took my coat and I throw it in the <span class="interior space">corner</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="626">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back. </sentence><sentence id="627">It never happened. </sentence><sentence id="628">So, then we went to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="629">We went in the inside where they told the people what to do, where to go. </sentence><sentence id="630">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out. </sentence><sentence id="631">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his <span

there. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I took it off of a <span class="spatial object">dead body</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I took a coat off, some kind of a blanket, so, we kept on

January at that time already and <span class="country">Europe</span> is very cold this time of the year. </sentence><sentence id="1408">So, they were looking for <span class="spatial

there and there was some snow then maybe two feet of snow was inside in those <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1411">It looks like they didn't use them for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1412">The first thing we did was a few guys over there with the little strength we had we pushed the snow to the <span class="region">center</span> a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1413">We went in maybe eighty ninety people in that open <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Some of the people you know we were all around, sitting all around that <span class="spatial object">car</span> but some of the people had no <span class="interior space">room</span> to get in there so they were staying in the center of the

there. </sentence><sentence id="1416">We were going maybe another day or so then we stopped in the <span class="building">station</span> and then one guy was hollering from down there he asked is there anybody that could hear us or see us, so with a little strength I had I went up and looked down. </sentence><sentence id="1417">So, he was saying in German how many people are in that <span

</sentence><sentence id="1420">They told them I would say approximately about a pound of bread, a little loaf of bread, the same thing about a pound of margarine. </sentence><sentence id="1421">When I give it out to everybody, there was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="1422">It was exactly what I said. </sentence><sentence id="1423">So, we were going for another few days, we were driving in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> for another few days and the only food we had was like a piece a bread and the margarine. </sentence><sentence id="1424">The margarine was so hard that I was nibbling in the margarine. </sentence><sentence id="1425">It was hard. </sentence><sentence id="1426">We didn't know where we were going, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Finally the

us a new number because the <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> number, the tattoo number was no good for <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1439">So, they give us a new number, and we have to go by the number now because nobody had a name. </sentence><sentence id="1440">My new number 117,682 so wherever you went you had to know the number because
