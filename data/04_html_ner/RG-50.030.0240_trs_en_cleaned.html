<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: I come from a family, my parents, my father was a businessman, he was a cattle dealer, in the small community of <span class="populated place">Jacovce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">We stayed in <span class="populated place">Jacovce</span> until I became six years old. </sentence><sentence id="19">I had an older sister and a younger brother. </sentence><sentence id="20">We then moved to a larger <span class="populated place">community</span> which is called <span class="populated place">Topol_any</span>, <span class="populated place">T-O-P-O-L-C-A-N- Y.C</span> witha umlaut [ha_ek]. </sentence><sentence id="21">And the reason for the move, because of <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">My father wanted to put us into a larger <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="building">school</span> which was in <span class="populated place">Topol_any</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">And we lived in <span class="populated place">Topol_any</span>, we started, uh, <span class="building">Jewish schools</span>, and soon after, two more children were born in our family. </sentence><sentence id="24">I can give you their names. </sentence><sentence id="25">My name used to be Moshe, which was, uh...they used to call me M - I - S - O, S with an <span class="spatial object">umlat</span> [Mio with a <span class="spatial object">ha_ek</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="26">My sister who was older than my, uh, than I am, was name was Rose, Ro_i--R - O - Z with an umlaut [ha_ek]- I. My younger brother, who was not quite two years younger than me, his name was Arpad, A - R - P- A - D; and I had a sister Marta, M- A- R- T- A; anda little brother, the baby brother, whose name was Maxmilian. </sentence><sentence id="27">We lived a fairly happy life in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">Well, it was part of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>--this was the region of <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, but our part was called Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="30">We were the Slovaks. </sentence><sentence id="31">Antisemitism was there, always there. </sentence><sentence id="32">I remember when we used to play soccer as kids, there was never boys against boys, it was always the Catholic against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="33">That was the kind of soccer games we used to play. </sentence><sentence id="34">But we got along as well as one could get along. </sentence><sentence id="35">We stuck to our ways and they stuck to theirs. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, we were quite religious, especially our mother. </sentence><sentence id="37">I even remember my bar mitzvah in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="38">Uh, my grandparents on my mother's side, my mother by the way came from another <span class="populated place">community</span>, uh I would say sixty, seventy kilometers from <span class="populated place">Topol_any</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">Her maiden name was Feldman, and our grandparents, her parents, were there at my bar mitzvah, which we called the <span class="building">grosse shul</span>--the big <span class="building">temple</span>, the big <span class="building">shul</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">Our rabbi was a very famous guy. </sentence><sentence id="41">His name was Abraham Weiss. </sentence><sentence id="42">And we had to go to <span class="building">temple</span>, to <span class="building">shul</span>, every morning and especially before I became bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="43">And then of course after that, every morning. </sentence><sentence id="44">We all went to the <span class="building">Jewish schools</span>, except my sister. </sentence><sentence id="45">My sister was sent to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">Now she was a pre-teener, pre-teenager, where my father's youngest sister lived; and she stayed with her a couple of years to go to <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh, I would say from "35 to "37. </sentence><sentence id="48">And then she was sent back when Hitler started the rumbles. </sentence><sentence id="49">This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">We knew of problems in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much attention. </sentence><sentence id="52">Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="53">But we found out later that it did. </sentence><sentence id="54">Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into <span class="country">Austria</span>, and annexed <span class="country">Austria</span> so to speak  as part of <span class="country">Germany</span>, he started to take the Jews on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">We heard on the radios, those of us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the <span class="building">shops</span> and that type of hooliganism that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="56">And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews were running away from <span class="country">Austria</span> and came to our <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">And my mother took an Austrian lady in to us. </sentence><sentence id="58">We didn't have a huge <span class="building">home</span> but the five children but we gave her a spot to stay. </sentence><sentence id="59">But most of all I remember is when the <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> mobilized its armed forces. </sentence><sentence id="60">And the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> which known to us as <span class="region">Sudetenland</span> into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">He wanted to annex <span class="populated place">Sudetenland</span> into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">That was a <span class="region">Germanic-speaking part</span> of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I remember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow <span class="dlf">street</span> as the five children and our mother walked with our father to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to wish him well, to say goodbye to him. </sentence><sentence id="64">And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, "peace in our time." </sentence><sentence id="65">And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably closed the <span class="dlf">door</span> of <span class="dlf">10 Downing Street</span>, Hitler marched not only into <span class="region">Sudetenland</span> but he took over the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians. </sentence><sentence id="66">But <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, the <span class="region">region</span> where I was born, didn't, never seen a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="67">Nazi soldiers never marched into <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, into <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">So what happened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L - I - N - K - A, was formed, and then in March 15, 1939, is when <span class="country">Slovakia</span> became the puppet government of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="69">The <span class="building">Hlinka Guards</span>, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did business with, that grew up, and lived with practically. </sentence><sentence id="70">They became the <span class="building">Guards</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: O.K., the Guards did what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Guards? </sentence><sentence id="128">Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards. </sentence><sentence id="129">So what happened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> as a matter of fact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast of their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German. </sentence><sentence id="130">I remember we couldn't, couldn't walk the <span class="dlf">streets</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="131">No more than three or four Jews could walk the <span class="dlf">streets</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="132">And, of course, curfew. </sentence><sentence id="133">By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">We couldn't <span class="spatial object">shop</span>, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours. </sentence><sentence id="135">And since my father was, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the oldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family. </sentence><sentence id="136">And you couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the <span class="spatial object">Hlinkas</span> would get to you and of course you were punished. </sentence><sentence id="137">Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and I and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the <span class="building">miller</span> and pick up flour so we could have bread. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it was all <span class="building">black market</span>, and you always paid through the nose. ( </sentence><sentence id="139">Laughter) Everyday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on <span class="spatial object">bulletin boards</span> - they had these little round, uh, <span class="interior space">stalls</span> where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and of course the <span class="building">businesses</span> were taken away from all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="141">My father business, my father's business was given to the person who worked for him. </sentence><sentence id="142">And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business, to sell the cattle. </sentence><sentence id="143">And my father never believed that anything would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="144">Almost to the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="145">He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people,  first of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there. </sentence><sentence id="146">No one's going to bother us. </sentence><sentence id="147">And second, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government. </sentence><sentence id="148">He sold cattle and horses to the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business. </sentence><sentence id="149">So he said no, nothing's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="150">This will, ah, this will pass. </sentence><sentence id="151">But it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="152">Because we were harassed, we were beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put us into <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor. </sentence><sentence id="154">Actually it was the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to <span class="country">Madagascar</span>." </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I was a small young teenager. </sentence><sentence id="156">But it didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="157">Instead of <span class="country">Madagascar</span>, myself, my older sister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the <span class="dlf">Town Square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">All young Jewish boys and girls. </sentence><sentence id="159">When they rounded us up, they told us that we're going back to our <span class="building">homes</span>, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you. </sentence><sentence id="160">They took us about two hours from our <span class="populated place">home town</span> to the first <span class="populated place">war camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">It was called <span class="building">Arbeitlager</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">And the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the name of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was <span class="populated place">Novaky</span>, N -O- V - A-K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian Hlinka Guards. </sentence><sentence id="163">Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="164">Let me, let me re-track back for a moment if I may. </sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when <span class="country">Germany</span> was invading <span class="country">Poland</span>, September Ist, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="166">And how we seen them, the German army was going through <span class="country">Slovakia</span> to get to <span class="country">Poland</span>, because we were first and then came <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">But we felt them. </sentence><sentence id="168">My father had to take the cattle from his <span class="interior space">stalls</span>, from his, and the horses, and deliver it to the <span class="dlf">Town Square</span> for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="169">Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka Guards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and and horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials. </sentence><sentence id="170">That was the first time that I'd seen a German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="171">And when we'd seen them on those little <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span> with the side little <span class="spatial object">car</span> and, and, and <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first time we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="172">This was the Wehrmacht at the time. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards were the people that spoke Slovak just like we did. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when we arrived to <span class="populated place">Novaky</span>, they loaded us on to <span class="spatial object">trains</span> after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">They came with us to our <span class="building">homes</span> so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these guards all over, all over the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Did you know any of your guards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Oh, absolutely, by names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Tell me about your conversation with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless. </sentence><sentence id="232">O.K. The word ""_id" was common. </sentence><sentence id="233">"id" is a Jew. " </sentence><sentence id="234">We finally got you _ids," and that type of words, and beating. </sentence><sentence id="235">They all had <span class="spatial object">clubs</span> and rifles and canes. </sentence><sentence id="236">Whatever they had they would beat you. </sentence><sentence id="237">These were people, this one guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our barber. </sentence><sentence id="238">We used to go to the <span class="building">barbershop</span> - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph) " The Jews were never deported to <span class="country">Madagascar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239"> <span class="populated place">Banau</span>, B - A - N - A- U. The poor guy perished in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but you know. </sentence><sentence id="240">And this Martin ek (ph) was my barber. </sentence><sentence id="241">He cut my hair, cut my family's hair, and he, you couldn't ask for a nicer guy during the time (laughter). </sentence><sentence id="242">He was also an alcoholic but most of them were. </sentence><sentence id="243">And when we arrived to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we seen guards from our <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">You would go close to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something. </sentence><sentence id="245">Boom, the first thing would happen you would get hit. </sentence><sentence id="246">When they took us to <span class="populated place">Novaky</span> by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, by, by <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>, and when we arrived there it was a huge <span class="building">complex</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">With wooden <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">Girls on one side, boys on the other side of the <span class="building">barrack</span>, <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">And we were assigned to our <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our <span class="building">barracks</span> and then the guards would read us the laws. </sentence><sentence id="250">And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251"><span class="country">Slovakia</span> was a <span class="region">farm country</span>, so the food was there. </sentence><sentence id="252">The cooks were our people. </sentence><sentence id="253">The Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks. </sentence><sentence id="254">We had meat, we had, we had potatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that. </sentence><sentence id="255">And we were also allowed at the time still to be receiving packages. </sentence><sentence id="256">So the parents would send some stuff to us. </sentence><sentence id="257">So that was still allowed because it was our, you know, still in our <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our <span class="building">barracks</span>, they told us after breakfast, you're going to report to work. </sentence><sentence id="259">What kind of work? </sentence><sentence id="260">Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful, just carrying bricks or stones and making piles. </sentence><sentence id="261">Because they didn't build anything. </sentence><sentence id="262">There was nothing to build. </sentence><sentence id="263">This was a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, just a big <span class="dlf">grounds</span> with <span class="dlf">holes</span> where they were digging, some people were digging sand. </sentence><sentence id="264">My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my bare hands and making a pile. </sentence><sentence id="265">And after we made that <span class="spatial object">pile</span> high, then we take that <span class="spatial object">pile</span> and make another pile. </sentence><sentence id="266">And this was the daily, daily routine. </sentence><sentence id="267">There was some people, there was even <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span> with small, small <span class="spatial object">cars</span> that ran on the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, that we pushed on the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we would just carry sand, dump it and carry more sand. </sentence><sentence id="269">No reason. </sentence><sentence id="270">There weren't <span class="building">homes</span> built. </sentence><sentence id="271">There weren't <span class="dlf">roads</span> built. </sentence><sentence id="272">There was just a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, just a <span class="populated place">detention camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">And beating. </sentence><sentence id="274">Yea, we still had music and our singing groups. </sentence><sentence id="275">None of us believed what, what was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="276">When in April 1942 the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, well actually it was the end of March, the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from <span class="populated place">Novaky</span> was taken and my brother Arpad was there and so was my sister Ro_i, Rose. </sentence><sentence id="277">I stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="278">Of course, I didn't know, we didn't know where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="279">Neither did they. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I found out of course much later, my sister Rose ended up in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">My brother Arpad ended up in <span class="populated place">Lublin-Majdanek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">Couple of months later my turn came. </sentence><sentence id="283">I, I left with a bunch of people, Slovakian people from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> also, and we, this is what they told us. </sentence><sentence id="284">This is how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="285">They lined us up in front of our <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">They told us we're going to be relocated to the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">Pack whatever you owned, report back in front. </sentence><sentence id="288">We did that. </sentence><sentence id="289">They loaded us into <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and I will never forget, just as, just as the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> started to move, in unison we all started to sing the Hatikvah. </sentence><sentence id="290">I'll never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="291">Just the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> moving, and we singing the <span class="spatial object">Hatikvah</span> anyway. </sentence><sentence id="292">And when we finished the <span class="building">Hatikvah</span>, still being Czechs and Slovaks, we sang the Czech national anthem. </sentence><sentence id="293">When we came, the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> stopped at a <span class="dlf">railroad siding</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294"><span class="dlf">Railroad siding</span> is for the, load, uh, <span class="spatial object">freight</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">We've seen, oh, I would say about twenty <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> lined up, on the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, and each <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> had a wooden plank, <span class="dlf">doors</span> wide open, and the plank leading into the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">They loaded us into the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>, between eighty and hundred of us, boys and girls together. </sentence><sentence id="297">A metal bucket was put on each end of the <span class="spatial object">car</span> which was used for <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">The <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>'s <span class="dlf">doors</span> were locked and sealed. </sentence><sentence id="299">We could hear them locking it. </sentence><sentence id="300">This was the  last time that we have seen the Slovakian Hlinka guards. </sentence><sentence id="301">Some of the boys got friendlier with the guards, and they say, "Goodbye to you. </sentence><sentence id="302">You know, this is it, we won't [see] you no more." </sentence><sentence id="303">And the <span class="spatial object">train</span> started to move, and <span class="populated place">Novaky</span> is approximately 24 hours distance from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="304">Of course, we didn't know we were going to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">They told us we were being relocated and our families will join you. </sentence><sentence id="306">Your families will soon join you. </sentence><sentence id="307">I would say approximately 24 hours later . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Tell me, before you go on, tell me about those 24 hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: That <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> - first of all, it was jam packed, uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="389">People were fighting for places. </sentence><sentence id="390">You could not, not all of us could sit down. </sentence><sentence id="391">Hardly anyone could lay down. </sentence><sentence id="392">People were crushing each other. </sentence><sentence id="393">And of course they were fighting for the <span class="interior space">bathroom facilities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">That was the worst part. </sentence><sentence id="395">Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the <span class="spatial object">buckets</span> would be over-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the comer of the <span class="spatial object">car</span> as you possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="396">We stopped once, on the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>, just the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> stopped once to relieve the buckets and they gave us some water, one, on one trip. </sentence><sentence id="397">I don't remember where - I was told it was in <span class="populated place">Jinna</span>, that was the name of the <span class="populated place">town</span>, but who could tell. </sentence><sentence id="398">And we got the <span class="spatial object">buckets</span> out and then they gave us some water. </sentence><sentence id="399">I would say next morning, now I would say next morning we arrived to our destination. </sentence><sentence id="400">The <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> stopped. </sentence><sentence id="401">The <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> were opened. </sentence><sentence id="402">And this was the first time that we have seen SS guards, SS soldiers, and SS officers. </sentence><sentence id="403">And every SS guard had a dog on a leash, either a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pincher. </sentence><sentence id="404">Mostly <span class="spatial object">German Shepherds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">Their rifles with bayonets sticking up, and either wooden walking cane, a bamboo cane or a whip in their hands. </sentence><sentence id="406">And of course, most of us, all of us in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> I should say, spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="407">If you were <span class="country">Czechoslovakian</span>, you spoke German, Hungarian and Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="408">That was our language. </sentence><sentence id="409">These were our languages. </sentence><sentence id="410">And they yelled, the Nazis would yell, "Juden raus schnell!"-- "All Jews out fast, fast!" </sentence><sentence id="411">With a beating. </sentence><sentence id="412">And we have seen, among the SS, people in striped uniforms, prisoner striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="413">And these were the boys that worked the <span class="dlf">railroad track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">Of course we didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="415">The Nazis, the SS would tell us to line up. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the boys, the prisoner boys, the people in <span class="building">prison</span> uniform, would come to us and tell us either in German or in Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="417">Of course, all done with beatings by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="418">When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up in rows of five, everything in <span class="populated place">Nazi concentration camp</span> was five, because of easier count, and with the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march. </sentence><sentence id="419">I would say a mile and a half maybe. </sentence><sentence id="420">And we came to a <span class="dlf">gate</span> of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">A <span class="dlf">gate</span> with a half moon sign, that says "Arbeit Macht Frei," work makes you free, or gives you freedom. </sentence><sentence id="422">After we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I'm going to jump a little bit if | may, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> for what, three, four months, and we used to march through this <span class="dlf">gate</span>, in and out of this <span class="dlf">gate</span>, with the orchestra playing. </sentence><sentence id="423">As we marched through this <span class="dlf">gate</span>, we used to say among each other, "Arbeit Macht Frei, <span class="building">Krematorium</span> drei"--"Work makes you free when you end up in <span class="building">crematorium</span> three." </sentence><sentence id="424">And those of us we always looked who survived, who's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="425">As we marched through the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, the girls on one side of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the boys on the other. </sentence><sentence id="426"><span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> is built of solid brick. </sentence><sentence id="427">It's, everything is brick. </sentence><sentence id="428">Even the <span class="dlf">road</span>, the <span class="dlf">streets</span> are made of brick. </sentence><sentence id="429">The <span class="building">barracks</span>, solid <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="430">Before the Nazis invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>, this part of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> used to be a <span class="populated place">Polish  Army camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">So they marched us through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> with whips and beatings and dogs jumping at us. </sentence><sentence id="432">We came to a huge <span class="building">brick building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">They shoved us into the huge <span class="building">brick building</span>, and there were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="434">There was <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, long <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">The first <span class="region">area</span> we had to undress, strip our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="436">There were hooks behind us. </sentence><sentence id="437">You put the clothing through a piece of <span class="dlf">wire</span>, hang the clothing up. </sentence><sentence id="438">Take our shoes off, put the shoes on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">Next <span class="spatial object">table</span> were the <span class="building">barbers</span>, the <span class="building">camp barbers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="440">Where they shaved our head, cut our hair, shaved the entire body. </sentence><sentence id="441">They said this for hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="442">Then we moved to another <span class="spatial object">table</span> where the tattooing was done. </sentence><sentence id="443">So the tatoo was done on left forearm. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was one person who rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle with the inkwell, and he would do the numbering. </sentence><sentence id="445">So my number is 65,316. </sentence><sentence id="446">That means there were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me. </sentence><sentence id="447">After the tattoo, tattooing was done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with. </sentence><sentence id="448">They gave us, issued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of wooden clogs, and a shirt. </sentence><sentence id="449">No socks or underwear. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then the last <span class="region">area</span>, when they gave us the uniform, they gave us two strips of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="451">The cloth I would say was about six inches long, maybe inch and a half wide. </sentence><sentence id="452">And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding with the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then the last item which was the most important item that we received was a round <span class="spatial object">bowl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="454">And this <span class="spatial object">bowl</span> was the life blood of your being. </sentence><sentence id="455">First of all, without it you couldn't get the meager rations that we got. </sentence><sentence id="456">And second, the <span class="interior space">bathroom facilities</span> were almost non-existent. </sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, uh, even at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, each <span class="building">barrack</span> on the bottom had a <span class="interior space">washroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">But you couldn't use it. </sentence><sentence id="459">It was only for the privileged. </sentence><sentence id="460">You could use it special times if you were quick, because they only gave you like two, three minutes. </sentence><sentence id="461">But most of us couldn't use it. </sentence><sentence id="462">So, when they gave us the numbers and the <span class="spatial object">bowl</span>, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="463">This was the, what they call today the <span class="building">Nazi documentation department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">These were, they were the officers that did all the paper work. </sentence><sentence id="465">And these were prisoners that worked in the <span class="building">Nazi documentation department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="466">Every <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, how many people arrived, and what their names, where they came from, where was the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from, where it originated, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="467">These people were the ones to do that type of work. </sentence><sentence id="468">And most of these people were actually office workers from <span class="building">homes</span> - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly. </sentence><sentence id="469">So after they documented all that, we no longer had names. </sentence><sentence id="470">The Nazis called us Haftlings, prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="471">I became <span class="building">Haftling</span> , prisoner 65,316. </sentence><sentence id="472">Then they marched us to our <span class="building">homes</span>, to our <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">In <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> as well as all <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, all <span class="building">buildings</span> where prisoners, <span class="building">Haftlings</span>, were housed, were known as <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">I was assigned to <span class="dlf">Block 16</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> , our main camp <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">Each <span class="building">barrack</span>, each <span class="dlf">block</span>, had between three to five people that were in charge of the <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, and their name, their, their ranks and names would be such. </sentence><sentence id="476">The head guy was called <span class="building">Blockaltester</span>, block elder. </sentence><sentence id="477">Next to him would be a guy called Stubendienst; "<span class="spatial object">Stube</span>" means <span class="interior space">room</span>, "Dienst," "assistant." </sentence><sentence id="478">He was the assistant of the Blockaltester and the third guy was the most important guy actually he was the Schreiber or the register and the reason for which he was so important because he would write people he had in each <span class="dlf">block</span>, and how much artificial tea or artificial coffee was served, how many slices of bread, and how much potato peel, potato soup was served in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="479">That guy was the one responsible for that. </sentence><sentence id="480">And everything was done by number. </sentence><sentence id="481">One of the most cruelest things in any <span class="populated place">camp</span> was called the  <span class="building">Appell</span>, the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="482">The roll call in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I will, uh, so many people got killed during roll call, murdered. </sentence><sentence id="483">Many people ran to the <span class="dlf">wires</span> just, just before roll call. </sentence><sentence id="484">Of course even that the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the <span class="dlf">electric wires</span> and fry. </sentence><sentence id="485">But that was the most cruelest thing. </sentence><sentence id="486">I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere between four and six o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="487">It depended on how early they got up. </sentence><sentence id="488">And then, you had to line up in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="489">And the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was counted with the main prisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a German criminal or came from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="490">I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear. </sentence><sentence id="491">The people in charge of the <span class="building">barracks</span> in most cases, and I would say 90% or better, were Germans or Poles, Germans or Poles. </sentence><sentence id="492">These were the ones with the green triangles - then the green triangles were, were the criminals. </sentence><sentence id="493">The red ones were the political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="494">And we had some red ones also in charge of us. </sentence><sentence id="495">But these people had better way, better living, better uniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes. </sentence><sentence id="496">They had little <span class="interior space">rooms</span> in each <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="497">Blockaltester had his <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="498"><span class="building">Stubedeinst</span> and Schreiber had a <span class="interior space">room</span>, and they had food which was organized in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="499">These were the murderers, the murderers among us. </sentence><sentence id="500">They were prisoners, but these are the killers. </sentence><sentence id="501">And during roll call they would kill many of us. </sentence><sentence id="502">Kill us for the simple reason that someone did it in their pants. </sentence><sentence id="503">They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled their uniform. </sentence><sentence id="504">Poor guy couldn't hold it. </sentence><sentence id="505"><span class="populated place">Dysentery</span> was, was something very, very common. </sentence><sentence id="506">After two weeks of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> your eyes would swell up from <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="507">Your, your whole face would be blown up from <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="508">Your legs would puff on you because of malnutrition and hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="509">And then you became a skeleton which was called Muselmann by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="510">After the roll call, and only after the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was counted and the count was correct, only then we were able to go to the labor, <span class="building">slave labor work sites</span> we were assigned to, <span class="building">labor Kommandos</span> they were called. </sentence><sentence id="511">Every group in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> as well as all <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> was called <span class="building">Kommandos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">I was assigned, well, let me give you the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="513">There were four people in each <span class="interior space">tier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">There were three tiers. </sentence><sentence id="515">Two men to a <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="516">No <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span>, no nothing, just one little blanket for two people. </sentence><sentence id="517">You never dared to take your uniform or shoes off, clogs off, because if you did the next morning you couldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="518">Because during working hours when we were working, many of us lost our clogs in the <span class="env feature">mud</span> and there, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="519">No shoes. </sentence><sentence id="520">You died sooner anyway. </sentence><sentence id="521">So after the roll call they gave us our first ration of the day which consisted of artificial tea, artificial coffee. </sentence><sentence id="522">The Nazis called it Ersatz tea, <span class="building">Ersatz cafe</span>, Ersatz's tea, <span class="building">Ersatz's cafe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="523">Then your Kapo Kommando, Kapo who was in charge of the <span class="building">Kommando</span>, you would have to report to him to be assigned to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="524">My first job in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was in <span class="populated place">Buna</span>, which was a <span class="building">munition factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525">We did, uh, artificial tires, rubber, uh, synthetic tires. </sentence><sentence id="526">There were two main <span class="building">factories</span> like that. </sentence><sentence id="527">One was the <span class="building">Krupp Werke</span> and one was <span class="populated place">Buna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="528">Krupp is well today in <span class="country">American</span> because they sell the <span class="spatial object">coffee makers</span> here. </sentence><sentence id="529">I see every time I walk by the <span class="building">department store</span> <span class="spatial object">coffee makers</span> I just cringe. </sentence><sentence id="530">I worked in <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="674">Q: Describe the work please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="676">A: O.K. The Buna work, there were a lot of civilian workers which the Nazis brought from different <span class="country">European countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="677">The masters, the foremen, uh, the engineers. </sentence><sentence id="678">I want to make this very strong that a prisoner could not converse with these civilian workers. </sentence><sentence id="679">We could not  talk with them, although some of us snuck through and tried to, uh, they would throw us sometimes a piece of bread if they weren't afraid, because these, these people too, they had an arm band and the arm band would identify them as civilian workers. </sentence><sentence id="680">See. </sentence><sentence id="681">They knew what was going on, but, but they couldn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="682">A lot, there were some from <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, those Yugoslavs, there were Poles, the Polish civilians. </sentence><sentence id="683">There were some people from <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="684">These were the people that were <span class="building">building</span>, that that did the work there. </sentence><sentence id="685">Actually these were the masters, we were the laborers. </sentence><sentence id="686">They would tell the <span class="building">SS</span> how many people they need and what they want us to do. </sentence><sentence id="687">And it was hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="688">Most of the time you didn't work with tools. </sentence><sentence id="689">Everything was done with hands. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was a break for lunch right around noon. </sentence><sentence id="691">The <span class="building">factory</span> whistle would blow and you'd go outside to lunch. </sentence><sentence id="692">And prisoners with <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> would bring our noon meal which consisted of the soup. </sentence><sentence id="693">The soup had mostly potato peels - no meat whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="694">Hardly none, no fat whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="695">Just a little margarine thrown into it. </sentence><sentence id="696">And by the time they brought it to us in, to different, you know, they had more groups to bring that. </sentence><sentence id="697">They brought it on a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> what they pushed by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="698">They didn't come by <span class="spatial object">cart</span> or <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="699">Pushed by prisoners to the <span class="building">work sites</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">By the time we got it of course it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="701">It didn't, you know, and then we go back to work half an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="702">Back to the same. </sentence><sentence id="703">I will never forget when they lined us up in rows of five to march back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you would carry fifty, sixty of our comrades on our shoulders, either dead or dying. </sentence><sentence id="704">Back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="705">Because no one was allowed to die outside or be left outside. </sentence><sentence id="706">Because when we marched through the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the <span class="dlf">gates</span> were open and they would count us there. </sentence><sentence id="707">Then we go to our own <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="708">But not <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> to your <span class="building">barrack</span> where you could relax and sit down and lay down. </sentence><sentence id="709">You stayed in front of your <span class="building">barrack</span> until the whistle blew, the horn blew, Appell. </sentence><sentence id="710">And the Appell was always yelled out from the first <span class="building">barrack</span> and then like an echo, each <span class="building">barrack</span> had a person that yelled Appell. </sentence><sentence id="711">There was an SS in charge and he would be in a <span class="building">tower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="712">He would be the one who would initiate the Appell call. </sentence><sentence id="713">And like an echo, it would just go throughout <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="714">The <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> itself, the <span class="populated place">Auschwitz camp</span> itself was not that huge. </sentence><sentence id="715">So when everyone was lined up, then the Lageraltester, the main prisoner who was in charge of the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span>, would, the SS hierarchy, the SS officers, they would count from one <span class="building">barrack</span> to the next to the next and the next until all. </sentence><sentence id="716">And this is how we sound over the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>, over the echo: <span class="dlf">Block</span> ; - <span class="interior space">Block seven</span>, count correct. </sentence><sentence id="717">Eight, correct, and so on and so on, correct, until they came to a <span class="dlf">block</span> where was not correct. </sentence><sentence id="718">You stood there until the person was found. </sentence><sentence id="719">In most cases, the person either was somewhere in dying under some, under something, under, under a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="720">Or he was so sick he didn't care one way or another whether he lives or dies. </sentence><sentence id="721">Or someone ran to the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, to the <span class="dlf">electric wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">But only after everyone was counted, even those we brought on our shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="723">He was dropped in front of his <span class="building">barrack</span> on the <span class="dlf">Appellplatz</span>, on the roll call place. </sentence><sentence id="724">And that's where he was. </sentence><sentence id="725">And after the roll call, each <span class="building">barrack</span> had to clean up their sick and, and the dead and carry them to a <span class="building">barrack</span> which was a holding place. </sentence><sentence id="726">And then the dead ones would be picked up the Leichen (ph) <span class="spatial object">Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="727">How would I translate leichen (ph) - as a dead, a Kommando that, this was a group of, of, of Jewish prisoners that worked with a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="728">They would go from <span class="building">barrack</span> to <span class="building">barrack</span>, from <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, to pick up the people that died at work, and those who died over night. </sentence><sentence id="729">And then they would be taken to the <span class="building">Leichenhaller</span> (ph), to the dead <span class="interior space">cell</span>, where they were stacked up like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="730">And the next after that, they would be taken to the <span class="interior space">gas  chambers</span>, or to the <span class="interior space">pits</span>, whichever was available, and the body would be burned. </sentence><sentence id="731">I survived <span class="populated place">Buna</span>...I would say, close to three months. </sentence><sentence id="732">Then one evening after roll call, a friend of mine from not too far from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> whom I got to know, he told me that he just got a job, and he said if there's a way to survive <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I think I got it. </sentence><sentence id="733">And there was a try out in front of <span class="dlf">Block Sixteen</span>, our <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">He was also in <span class="building">Block 16</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">He asked me, told me, try out and see if you can make it. </sentence><sentence id="736">So the try out was held by <span class="building">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="737">They had <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> there, and they put <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> on the arm to see how fast you can run. </sentence><sentence id="738">Of course, we didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="739">I made it. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I was assigned to a group called the <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="741">It's like the country of, it was named by the Nazis and the prisoners, the Polish prisoners named it <span class="country">Canada</span> Kommando and the reason they named it <span class="country">Canada</span>, because the final solution, of course I knew nothing about final solution in those days. </sentence><sentence id="742">I knew nothing about anything else far as, other than being in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="743">But the <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span> was, or the organization was called <span class="country">Canada</span>, because we unloaded all incoming Jews from every Nazi-occupied <span class="country">country</span>, <span class="country">European country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">By this time, this was still in 1942, this was like September 1942, this time they were bringing in entire families. </sentence><sentence id="745">Not just young people. </sentence><sentence id="746">Families from their <span class="building">homes</span>, families from <span class="populated place">holding camps</span> like <span class="populated place">Novaky</span>, and from, uh, <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, from from <span class="country">France</span>, from <span class="country">Belgium</span>, from <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747">We had people coming in from every different, every <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="748">And the <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span> consisted of start out I would say about four hundred and fifty people. </sentence><sentence id="749">And we had two shifts, day shift and night shift. </sentence><sentence id="750">I was assigned to the day shift, and we would go to the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="751">This is still Auschwitz I.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="936">The <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>, after we unloaded the people, after the Nazis made sure that we go to the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, and that we don't speak to no one, the main job was to tell the people and try to keep them calm. </sentence><sentence id="937">And when, the first thing that would happen after the people were unloaded, in those days there were <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, <span class="spatial object">dump trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="938">The first people they would get rid of were women with children, the old, the sickly, the ill, uh, the people with, uh, cripples. </sentence><sentence id="939">These people would be loaded on to <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and taken away right away, and the last people that the Nazis would march were the people that were selected to go to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="940">With the belongings, some of it on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, but most of it in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="941">And when these people were taken, men to the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span>, women to the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span>, and the same process was dealt with them as it was done with us. </sentence><sentence id="942">Numbered and shaved and showered and so on. </sentence><sentence id="943">Assigned to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="944">Only then we started to work on the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> which was loaded in to <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and it went to the <span class="building">Canada warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="945">It was a huge complex where girl <span class="building">Canada Kommandos</span>, mostly Slovakian girl <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>, worked. </sentence><sentence id="946">And their job, they were, they were the only ones dressed up almost like, not a civilian but nice, a dress, and they all had babushkas [NB: kerchiefs] tied on their heads, because their heads were shaven. </sentence><sentence id="947">And these girls worked with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="948">Disinfecting of the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="949">And when we, we, first we would do this. </sentence><sentence id="950">Load it into <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="951">Unload it into <span class="building">Canada warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="952">And there were <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> in front of us, SS guards walking back and forth watching us, what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="953">And we would take first the valuables would we put into <span class="spatial object">boxes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="954">Monies in one <span class="region">area</span>, gold and watches and rings and that type of stuff in another <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="955">And everything had its place. </sentence><sentence id="956">Then we started to work with the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="957">Of course, we search the clothing - search the pockets, the shoulders, the shoulder pads were, were, were felt for any, any hard stuff or any soft clothing, or soft monies, and then we had to rip some of it off. </sentence><sentence id="958">Even shoe heels were opened, because the Nazis found out that the shoe heels the people saved. </sentence><sentence id="959">And toothpaste, in those days because the toothpaste in <span class="country">Europe</span> was not the greatest, not like <span class="country">America</span>, and they would squeeze and look for diamonds and gold, which was found there. </sentence><sentence id="960">Then we started to work with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="961">Separate the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="962">Men's, women's and children's clothing separate. </sentence><sentence id="963">There was a blanket on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> always where we dumped the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="964">After the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span> was full enough, you bundle, you put on your shoulder and took it to the girls. </sentence><sentence id="965">Now, let me make a very strong point. </sentence><sentence id="966">When these bundles of clothing were taken to the girls, many of us brought food to the girls, in the blankets. </sentence><sentence id="967">But, there was always an SS man standing by, he was watching of course the girls too. </sentence><sentence id="968">But the girls, he couldn't watch the girls doing that, because the girls wanted to, working with the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="969">They were watching what, as we were dumping, if there was any food. </sentence><sentence id="970">They knew we were bringing food there. </sentence><sentence id="971">In a way they let us, we played a cat and mouse game with these guys. </sentence><sentence id="972">If they caught you, you got beaten. </sentence><sentence id="973">Twenty-five on your behind. </sentence><sentence id="974">You bend down and then you get twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="975">You had to count them, twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="976">And you count twenty-five on your buttocks, and the Nazis  2 stop you. </sentence><sentence id="977">They say, how many did I give you. </sentence><sentence id="978">And you say, seventeen. </sentence><sentence id="979">Wrong. </sentence><sentence id="980">All over again. </sentence><sentence id="981">This was a sport. </sentence><sentence id="982">They called it sport. </sentence><sentence id="983">And that's how we used to bring the food to the girls. </sentence><sentence id="984">And, information to the girls from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">She had a brother there, or a father there, not working in <span class="country">Canada</span> Kommando but working in <span class="populated place">Marashar</span> (ph) which was uh, uh, people that work with the bricks and, and, and, mortar, that type of people. </sentence><sentence id="986">And they would say, your father told me to say this and that, they could keep up and so on, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="987">And then they would write, they would find pencils. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1041">Q: How, how did they find pencils? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1043">A: From us. </sentence><sentence id="1044">From <span class="country">Canada</span> Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1045">We had the pencils, the papers, the watches, the <span class="spatial object">clocks</span>, the compasses. </sentence><sentence id="1046">We, we, people from Europe, from <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, they used to bring stuff with them that you wouldn't believe. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And of course everyone brought the finest finery they had because they felt they can sell it to save their life. </sentence><sentence id="1048">That was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="1049">They even told them, some of them, bring, bring, because winters, you need, a lot of them came with nice fur coats and, you know, it was all gone. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And so, I mean, I mean, so we would bring these girls and the girl would send a note to their father or their brother or their cousin or their husband. </sentence><sentence id="1051">There was one boy who died last year, his name was Fisher. </sentence><sentence id="1052">His wife was working in <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>, in women's <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1053">He worked in the men's <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1054">So that's how these boys, that's how that was. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And I, I worked there, the <span class="building">warehouse</span> and the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Then I was put on the night shift. </sentence><sentence id="1057">You know, you see, you couldn't survive <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> by yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1058">You had to have a partner. </sentence><sentence id="1059">In Yiddish it was called, in Hebrew it was called <span class="building">shitif</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1060">Shitif (ph) is a partner. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And I had three partners. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Not one of them is alive. </sentence><sentence id="1063">The last one was Fisher, who died uh last year. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And without a partner you couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1065">After we finished a day's work at <span class="building">Canada Kommando</span>, you just couldn't go <span class="building">home</span>, back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, without being searched, first at the <span class="building">work site</span> - lined up, stripped naked in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And if you weren't stripped naked, your pants dropped because they knew that some of us carried money in the places that is, uh, kind of dark. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Uh, but we do, we also knew how to smuggle out, smuggle the stuff in. </sentence><sentence id="1068">For instance, you in this <span class="interior space">row</span>, and your friend is in the <span class="interior space">row</span> in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="1069">You always stood behind your friend, behind your partner. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And as you partner was already searched, you shoved it to him. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And he stepped forward. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And then you were clear. </sentence><sentence id="1073">A lot of times we got caught, beaten and caught. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Let me give you one incident what would happen to the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1075">After the girls cleaned the clothing, it was bundled again, and carried by us, there was at the <span class="building">Canada warehouse</span>, there was a <span class="dlf">railroad siding</span>, <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, with <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> waiting. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And this was taken by us, loaded into <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, into <span class="spatial

know, I don't know if names, German officers" names mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Uh, there was one guy named Otto Graff (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1080">There was another guy named <span class="building">Unterscharfiihrer Wiglet</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1081">That's a rank. </sentence><sentence id="1082">He was in charge of the <span class="building">Canada warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And a young boy from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> (ph), a Polish Jewish boy, as he, the one boy stayed in the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>, in the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, and stacked the bundles, and the other ones like us, we would carry the bundles. </sentence><sentence id="1084">He would fill the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1085">This boy from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> hid himself with the bundles and the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span> took off. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Now it's evening time, ready to be lined up to go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And we were counted. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Fisher, by the way, was a registrar of the Canada  3 Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Besides being working there as a Canada Kommando worker, he had the job of registering all the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1090">He's counting, he was short one. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Now, they started looking. </sentence><sentence id="1092">First all over the <span class="building">warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1093">A lot of us would rest sometime without the Nazis knowing in the <span class="spatial object">bundle</span> where the girls worked, on top of the <span class="spatial object">heap</span>, and they would cover us and let us rest. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And they would take, we had lemons a lot of times from the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1095">You know, the lemons would come, they would make hot lemonade. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Just hot water, but there was a place that cooked the food, you know, that cooked for the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And we'd get hot water from there and make lemon, or squeeze the lemon into hot water. </sentence><sentence id="1098">So this boy who was bundled himself up in, in with the clothing, <span class="spatial object">train</span> left and he went with it. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Of course, we didn't know he went with it. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Looking for him, the Nazis are looking for him, not us. </sentence><sentence id="1101">The Nazis and the Kapos are the ones who start looking, searching the, all <span class="building">Canada warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1102">Can't find him. </sentence><sentence id="1103">All of a sudden Otto Graff, the SS officer, jumps on his <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>, goes after the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And they bring him back. </sentence><sentence id="1105">As close as I'm sitting to you, there was a <span class="env feature">tree</span> on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Otto Graff lines the boy up against the <span class="env feature">tree</span> and goes to his neck, and shoots him right here, in front of our eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And he tells us right then and then, this is how you will end up if you try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And we carried the boy from <span class="populated place">Grundo</span>, I can't think of his last, his first name, Jankl (ph), and carried him back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Many of us tried. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2402">Q: We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with Mengele? </sentence><sentence id="2403">I gather you did so often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2406">A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, not to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in May 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2407">I still remember when, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the <span class="building">doctors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2408">The doctors were the ones. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Because in all the <span class="building">Krankenbaus</span>, all the, all the <span class="interior space">sick bays</span>, where ever they put prisoners, there never doctors. </sentence><sentence id="2410">The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no longer was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2411">And they had a holding, they was a 7, 11 block in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2412"><span class="dlf">Block 7</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And this is the <span class="dlf">block</span> that they would take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just walk them in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> to, to the <span class="building">crematorias</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2415">So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about the Mengele selections in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, OK. </sentence><sentence id="2416">Of course, we didn't know when the selection would be. </sentence><sentence id="2417">But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2418">The whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was taken out to Appellplatz, to roll call place, lined up in rows of five, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet. </sentence><sentence id="2419">And Mengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfihrer, and also the commandant; they would go from <span class="building">barrack</span> to <span class="building">barrack</span>, <span class="dlf">block</span> to <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2420">And behind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele would, this is how, how it would be. </sentence><sentence id="2421">You in a row of five, always in rows of five. </sentence><sentence id="2422">The first five, step forward. </sentence><sentence id="2423">Mengele would walk in front and in back. </sentence><sentence id="2424">As he walked this way, left or right, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because, we didn't know, we found out later how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="2425">First, first time, second time, you didn't know which, what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2426">If you living or if you going to die now. </sentence><sentence id="2427">Those who left their clothing were taken into a <span class="dlf">holding block</span> and Mengele's selections would last practically all day because by the time he completed - <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> was a huge <span class="populated place">camp</span> - by the time he completed the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span>, OK, after he finished the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, those who of course the clothing stayed behind were taken into another <span class="dlf">block</span> and waited until everybody was taken from all, the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span>, then they were standing there. </sentence><sentence id="2428">You could hear them yell, scream, and beg for <span class="env feature">water</span>, beg for, for help. </sentence><sentence id="2429">They knew where they were going see. </sentence><sentence id="2430">See, and those of us who stayed, we picked up our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2431">Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos and by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we were beaten into a, uh, <span class="interior space">shower area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2432">And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with the number outside and threw them in a huge <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, in, in a <span class="interior space">room</span>, where Zyklon B gas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2433">They disinfected the clothing while they disinfected us. </sentence><sentence id="2434">Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water, some sort of a disinfecter. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And then they opened the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, the <span class="interior space">room</span> where, where the clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2436">But the gas fumes were still there. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time. </sentence><sentence id="2438">And, uh, I was fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me under their arms and took me outside and ran me back and forth, breathing for air. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And that's how they got me through. </sentence><sentence id="2440">That's how I came out of that. </sentence><sentence id="2441">I already had enough gas in me so  7 if, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="2442">I would have died right there. </sentence><sentence id="2443">So we picked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, back to our own <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2444">The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2445">He was the one who would be in charge at the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, at the <span class="dlf">siding</span>, at, at what they, the Nazis called it the <span class="dlf">Rampe</span>, the <span class="dlf">ramp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2446">When he came to the <span class="dlf">ramp</span>, the first thing he would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would get rid of those first. </sentence><sentence id="2447">He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is your name, , what is your profession and how old are you. </sentence><sentence id="2448">And left, right, left, right and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2449">After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was looking, pregnant women and twins. </sentence><sentence id="2450">We really didn't know what he was doing with them at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2451">But he would, he called them "<span class="populated place">Schlingen</span>" (ph) [<span class="populated place">Zwillingen</span>?], </sentence><sentence id="2452">the twins. </sentence><sentence id="2453">He would take the twins into his <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2454">I would see Mengele every <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and especially in early May 1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in. </sentence><sentence id="2455">When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele was there constantly. </sentence><sentence id="2456">He had a <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>, and he would ride in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, up and down the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, just looking, on the <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>, looking for anything that he wanted to look at. </sentence><sentence id="2457">Of course, we didn't know what he was looking at. </sentence><sentence id="2458">Always afraid of this man. </sentence><sentence id="2459">I can still remember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when he, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of. </sentence><sentence id="2460">Actually three. </sentence><sentence id="2461"><span class="populated place">Palich</span> (ph) was one. </sentence><sentence id="2462"><span class="populated place">Palich</span> was another one who was. </sentence><sentence id="2463">He, Palich actually did this. </sentence><sentence id="2464">Palici's favorite thing was to do to line people up in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>--Auschwitz I-- against the <span class="dlf">wall</span> to see how many he could kill with one bullet. </sentence><sentence id="2465">A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of <span class="populated place">Palish</span> quite well. </sentence><sentence id="2466">I didn't know much about <span class="populated place">Palish</span> except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he also ride, rode a <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2467">He would line up people, two three people in a <span class="dlf">row</span>, see how many he could kill with one bullet. </sentence><sentence id="2468">Lined them up together. </sentence><sentence id="2469">And the third person, who also came in "43, actually end of "43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfiihrer Moll, M - O - L - L. He became in charge of the <span class="building">crematorias</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And also, he also was the mentor of the <span class="dlf">pits</span>, the <span class="dlf">pits</span> that they were digging because the <span class="building">crematorias</span> couldn't, couldn't hold enough people, burn and gas enough people fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="2471">So he used the <span class="dlf">pits</span> to burn the people. </sentence><sentence id="2472">But the <span class="dlf">pits</span> didn't work well. </sentence><sentence id="2473">Because I remember the <span class="spatial object">Greek transports</span> that came and and he, he took some of the Greek boys working the <span class="dlf">pits</span> and with bare feet they were, they were stomping the hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned in there. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And the bodies just kept, kept coming back up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
