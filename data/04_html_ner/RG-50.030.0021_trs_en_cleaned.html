<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Tell me about the time in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where we ended...where we lived was a little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">It, it was fascinating to me. </sentence><sentence id="238">I had never seen a uh a uh an <span class="building">establishment</span> like <span class="populated place">Korolovka</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="239">It was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">It had no <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">It had no sanitation. </sentence><sentence id="242">It had no water supply. </sentence><sentence id="243">It had no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="244">It uh...you had a wasser treiger (ph) who had to bring the <span class="env feature">water</span> to the people who paid him. </sentence><sentence id="245">You uh...you uh...there were approximately sixteen to eighteen hundred Jews in that little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was a natural <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">It was like a <span class="spatial object">stetl</span> from the time of, which Shalom Alehem described. </sentence><sentence id="248">I have never been in such a <span class="building">stetl</span> and uh for me it was really fascinating to to to to study it. </sentence><sentence id="249">It uh...one doctor. </sentence><sentence id="250">One Jewish doctor. </sentence><sentence id="251">One Jewish dentist. </sentence><sentence id="252">The doctor was Dr. Teibers (ph) and everyone had a sufix in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="253">Dr. Teibers was called <span class="building">Tiberhazel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">The dentist was called...his name was Gunie Wiesenthal...was called Gunie Pipick (ph) because he was uh heavy. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh the Jews lived around a <span class="dlf">remick</span> (ph), the <span class="dlf">ring platz</span> (ph) in the center of which was a <span class="building">pharmacy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">Magister Schwartz was the the pharmacist. </sentence><sentence id="257">These were attached <span class="building">houses</span> but the the Germans didn't really need to establish a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">There was a natural <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> right there. </sentence><sentence id="259">They just established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that <span class="region">area</span> and no Jew is permitted to go out. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was difficult to reinforce this because the <span class="dlf">borders</span> of that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews were able to communicate with the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="261">Having done commerce and business with them for so many years, they knew each other and uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh we had problems with food. </sentence><sentence id="263">I saw immediately that uh uh I have to to do something to uh to establish a source of food and uh I went to that Dr. Teibers if he could direct to me his uh overflow. </sentence><sentence id="264">He said there is really no overflow at this time, and you know, uh in that time you didn't pay for a visit. </sentence><sentence id="265">You, you...the farmers or the people who came for medical consultation paid in uh in food. </sentence><sentence id="266">So...but he said...and he gave this advice. </sentence><sentence id="267">If you get the permission to practice outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in the little <span class="populated place">community</span>, because there are no doctors around here, uh we...you you could uh you could survive. </sentence><sentence id="268">I would like to mention here the attitude of the Jews in that little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">When I came in, the Russian had left. </sentence><sentence id="270">The Russian had been there, in <span class="populated place">Korolovka</span>, since the seventeenth of uh September of uh 1939 when they entered the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>, and there was...the attitude of the Jews was not uh friendly towards the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="271">Many Jews had been deported. </sentence><sentence id="272">So were many Ukrainian who had been deported, especially Ukrainians who belonged to the National uh Nationalistic organization. </sentence><sentence id="273">Ukrainians were very uh very nationalistic in their political aspiration and as soon as Hitler attacked <span class="country">Russia</span>, the <span class="region">area</span> was flooded with uh leaflets in which uh they uh were proclaiming that the time had come to establish the uh <span class="populated place">Volna Ukraina</span> (ph), that means the free <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">The leaflets were signed by a Ukrainian uh uh uh leader by the name of Stephan Bandera who established a group of people later who uh carried his name and they were called Banderovitsis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="275">Very anti- Semitic and very anti-Soviet. </sentence><sentence id="276">They said the time has come to proclaim the free <span class="populated place">Ukraina</span>, to kill the Jews and the Communists. </sentence><sentence id="277">The uh...I didn't know how to go about getting the permission and I was directed to what the chief of the Judenrat , the Judenaltester who was a man by the name of Max Glickstern, Glickstern. </sentence><sentence id="278">Max Glickstern was married to a uh woman from the <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span> by the name of Hilda, Hilda uh Zinreich and was a cousin of the, my friend Gabriel Zinreich, so I had access to him. </sentence><sentence id="279">He was a businessman who never did very well, but when he came to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> he was already nominated to be the elder of the Judenrat . </sentence><sentence id="280">Uh he uh lived like a king really. </sentence><sentence id="281">He had power. </sentence><sentence id="282">Also, being a small <span class="populated place">community</span> but the powers uh con...uh con...confer power to a human being and his attitude changes completely and uh it did on uh Max too. </sentence><sentence id="283">While I would have to say that in many instances he behaved very honestly, still people who had money to bribe and the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> was bribable to a very, very large degree. </sentence><sentence id="284">So was everybody. </sentence><sentence id="285">Uh there's...uh belonging to their admini....to the so-called Jewish administration uh he gave me a uh a...he got for me letter signed by a priest in a small <span class="populated place">community</span> uh outside <span class="populated place">Korolovka</span> by the name of Bicewslote (ph). </sentence><sentence id="286">He directed me. </sentence><sentence id="287">He sent letters to the uh lecaspoiutove (ph) which was the Kreisars (ph) of the of the Ukrainian physician who was in charge of the <span class="region">area</span>, and he gave me permission to the...uh to practice there. </sentence><sentence id="288">The letter from the priest was signed by a priest by the name of Stamosese (ph) who was the leader of the Ukrainian organization. </sentence><sentence id="289">And we were brought by a uh uh man whose family later survived the war by the name of Sturmer who was a person who had intimate contact with the farmers around <span class="populated place">Korolovka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">He still managed to keep a couple of horses hidden in someplace outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and he brought us to <span class="populated place">Benceslote</span> (ph) and now started for me a a very interesting uh uh practice. </sentence><sentence id="291">It lasted no more than six months because the <span class="region">area</span> was later declared in May uh "<span class="building">42 Judenrein</span> . </sentence><sentence id="292">When we came there uh he brought us to the <span class="building">house</span> of the man by the name of Samy Reinstein who had a who had a <span class="building">dwelling</span> where he had what they call it <span class="building">propinatzia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">He sold liquor, schnaps and uh small

</sentence><sentence id="296">Father Shamosheshin (ph) spoke some German. </sentence><sentence id="297">He was a lean mean in his early fifties or late forties. </sentence><sentence id="298">He uh uh

been uh taken over by the Soviets and transformed into a <span class="dlf">state farm</span> and the Germans left it the same way. </sentence><sentence id="303">A week later an event occurred which uh which was important. </sentence><sentence id="304">Somebody knocked at the <span class="dlf">window</span> of our of our <span class="interior space">room</span> and uh when...Mr. Reinstein, Samy

for me was a militant (ph) from the militia, Ukrainian militia. </sentence><sentence id="308">I found the uh the wife of the priest in severe upper abdominal pain. </sentence><sentence id="309">She had a gall bladder attack, gall stones. </sentence><sentence id="310">She said she had it for many years. </sentence><sentence id="311">She was in agony. </sentence><sentence id="312">She was

promptly vomited as soon as I gave it to her, even before I thought it. </sentence><sentence id="314">But she fell asleep and uh I left her for a couple of hours and I came next morning. </sentence><sentence id="315">I found her in uh in uh the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> cooking, full of enthusiasm. </sentence><sentence id="316">Doctor, you cured me. </sentence><sentence id="317">I said what do you mean. </sentence><sentence id="318">I was told the only cure for me was an operation and here I am free. </sentence><sentence id="319">I feel fine. </sentence><sentence id="320">It is possible that the injection had relieved the spasm and the <span class="env feature">stones</span> had passed into the <span class="interior space">small

( </sentence><sentence id="321">laughter) As a result of it next Sunday as Samy Reinstein told me, the priest in <span class="building">church</span> in his sermon to the community said you can do what you want with our local Jews...there were twelve or fifteen Jewish families still in <span class="populated place">Benceslote</span> (ph) but the Romanian doctor you shouldn't touch. </sentence><sentence id="322">And the term Romanian doctor remained with us for the whole time while I was in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">Uh a week later we were honored with a fat roasted duck sent by the priest with his thanks. </sentence><sentence id="324">Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="325">And a week later when I came to visit his wife, he was very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="326">Took me into the uh into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> uh and said I would like to show you something. </sentence><sentence id="327">He showed me a book published many years before. </sentence><sentence id="328">It was called <span class="building">Zolotaknina Hatmana Skoropatzkoro</span> (ph), the Golden Book of the Hatman Skoropatzki. </sentence><sentence id="329">Skoropatzki was one of the hatmans who had fought in the early twenties during the civil war against the new Soviet power. </sentence><sentence id="330">The the group...the soldiers of hatman Skoropatzki were known to have performed, to have quite killed many Jews. </sentence><sentence id="331">Among the pictures in that book, he showed me a picture...he said that's me. </sentence><sentence id="332">Was a young man in military uniform with a C C on his uh collar. </sentence><sentence id="333">C C is S S...it's the...but it has nothing to be the German SS. </sentence><sentence id="334">He said it it it is <span class="building">Sichobeitselie Kovetz</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="335">Sich (ph) was the national fighting organization of the Ukrainian uh uh Nationalist uh movement and uh Father Shamosheshin was the leader in his <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">His word meant law there. </sentence><sentence id="337">Whatever Father Shamosheshin said, went. </sentence><sentence id="338">Naturally, we were now somehow under the protection of Father Shamosheshin. </sentence><sentence id="339">A month later an event took place which really uh was a lucky incident. </sentence><sentence id="340">One night somebody rang the bell uh...rang the bell...knocked on my <span class="dlf">door</span>...no bell...knocked on the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">It was, as it turned out, a Polish refugee who had...from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> who had tried in 1939 to to go by <span class="spatial object">car</span> to <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">We were not far from the <span class="dlf">Romanian border</span>, some hundred and fifty kilometers, and his <span class="spatial object">car</span> broke down near <span class="populated place">Bielce</span> (ph) and he couldn't...and before he could repair the <span class="spatial object">car</span> the Soviets had uh marched in, had closed the <span class="dlf">border</span>, and his name was Zarenski or Zarubski. </sentence><sentence id="343">He was a young engineer from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">He said please come. </sentence><sentence id="345">My wife is dying. </sentence><sentence id="346">I came to his <span class="building">house</span> and I found her almost bled out. </sentence><sentence id="347">She had a vaginal bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="348">She had an incomplete abortion and what she needed was a little scraping. </sentence><sentence id="349">She was almost in coma. </sentence><sentence id="350">She she had a pulse of over 200. </sentence><sentence id="351">She...,there was no uh uh her blood pressure was extremely low. </sentence><sentence id="352">I I told him to get immediate some <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> to take her to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">In <span class="populated place">Borosow</span> (ph) it was the nearest <span class="building">hospital</span>, but there was also a <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">I knew a couple of doctors...one Doctor un Rabinowitz (ph) and Dr. Rosenblatt (ph) who uh they are able to perform a uh a uh D&amp;C.

</sentence><sentence id="505">Uh food. </sentence><sentence id="506">Food and during the summer of "42 we heard that this was the rumor that the of the Gestapo from <span class="populated place">Stanislow</span> (ph) is around in the <span class="region">area</span> liquidating <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="507">That means aktion. </sentence><sentence id="508">We established a uh guard every <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">In that time I stayed in the <span class="building">house</span> of a certain Aaron Spotheim, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">Aaron Spotheim had a of : , that means how much. </sentence><sentence id="511">That means he was a bad man. </sentence><sentence id="512">He was really a...not a very friendly uh person. </sentence><sentence id="513">Uh the whole <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> real...uh really didn't like him very much but he he uh let us in and so we were happy there and with his help when the aktion star...in the <span class="region">area</span> started, we we decided to build our own <span class="interior space">bunker</span> or our own front. </sentence><sentence id="514">Being uh what he was, , he said nobody should know it. </sentence><sentence id="515">I don't want anybody to come in to that, in to that uh hiding place from our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="516">So nobody really knew about our <span class="region">hiding place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">I thought in that time that our hiding place was a good hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="518">We had...you know, the <span class="building">houses</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, around the were attached <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="519">The <span class="building">house</span> attached to Mr. uh to Mr. Spotheim's <span

</sentence><sentence id="523">Nobody knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="524">I was witnessing...looking out from when the aktion took place and seeing in what ways they collected the people in to what they called the <span class="dlf">Umshagplatz</span> (ph) there in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because because they had to take them, to take the Jews by large <span

for sure. </sentence><sentence id="527">It really didn't make sense. </sentence><sentence id="528">The whole plan of the annihilation of the Jews was conceived in such a diabolic way...having a Jewish Judenrat to collaborate, to fulfill the orders of the Germans because they had no way, no different way, no way out. </sentence><sentence id="529">Having installed the Jewish police and here is an element which I would like to mention. </sentence><sentence id="530">To a large degree the <span class="building">Jewish police</span> was formed by former lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="531">They were so brutal. </sentence><sentence id="532">Their language was so crude. </sentence><sentence id="533">The way...how they uh how they behaved toward the population was so revolting that many times we asked ourselves, how come these educated people...and they...you had to consider them educated people to a large degree in comparison to the other people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> who who were not educated, who didn't have any <span class="building">university</span> schooling. </sentence><sentence id="534">It uh behaved in such a way...the circumstances created it. </sentence><sentence id="535">Example. </sentence><sentence id="536">During the summer of "42, seeing that I really had nobody to rely on...I'm a stranger...I'm a foreigner...who is going to help me? </sentence><sentence id="537">I had...we had no money. </sentence><sentence id="538">I started to explore the area around <span class="populated place">Korulovka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="539">In one of these explorations I got into another <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> by the name of <span class="populated place">Czortkow</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="540">It was a bigger <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">It had five thousand Jews there and the leader, the Judenaltester, was a lawyer by the name of Dr. Ebner (ph). </sentence><sentence id="542">You know in the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, every lawyer was called Herr doctor. </sentence><sentence id="543">I wanted what they called a psheapuska (ph). </sentence><sentence id="544">Pshepuska in Polish means a passirchein (ph), a permit, because I wanted to make my way or to find a way toward the <span

a militia man in ann...to say if Dr. Ebner can receive me, I don't know what the militia if he understood very well, but I ended up really in front of Dr. Ebner who said, who are you? </sentence><sentence id="547">What do you want?Very hostile. </sentence><sentence id="548">I said, look. </sentence><sentence id="549">I'm a physician from <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>, you know, <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">As a matter of fact I was trying to...<span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> had a a deputy by the name of Meyer Ebner...I say...the same last name... said you probably must be related. </sentence><sentence id="551">He said, sure I'm related. </sentence><sentence id="552">What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="553">His attitude was...he called the militia man in and told him in Polish uh <span class="populated place">Czortkow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">That means search him. </sentence><sentence id="555">I didn't know what...and he said uh see if he had, if he has grini papimna (ph). </sentence><sentence id="556">That means dollars. </sentence><sentence id="557">I didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="558">He says what do you want? </sentence><sentence id="559">I say I would like a , a <span class="building">pshapuska</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="560">He said, look doctor. </sentence><sentence id="561">I have no time. </sentence><sentence id="562">You are bothering me. </sentence><sentence id="563">You take my time away. </sentence><sentence id="564">I have...I have my people to take care of. </sentence><sentence id="565">Get out of my <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or I'll give you over to the <span class="building">Gestapo</span> myself. </sentence><sentence id="566">I was really amazed at that hostile reaction and I was very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="567">I left that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because he said in ten minutes you have to disappear from my <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="569"><span class="populated place">Czortkow</span> was a <span class="populated place">city</span> which looked or is a <span class="populated place">city</span> which looked like a <span class="building">fortress</span>. </sentence><sentence id="570">It had big uh tall uh uh <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="571">It was one of the <span class="populated place">eastern cities</span> of the old Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and probably for protection against invasions from the east, but it was a a frightening <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">I left the <span class="populated place">city</span> in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="573">I was disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="574">I was angry. </sentence><sentence id="575">I was hungry, tired, and I came and throwing me out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, Dr. Ebner saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="576">Outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I was exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="577">I looked for a place, a , and I fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="578">Until in the morning I heard uh I heard <span class="spatial object">engine</span> uh noise. </sentence><sentence id="579">I looked out and I saw <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> filled with police, German police, Ukrainian police. </sentence><sentence id="580">They were liquidating the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in that day. </sentence><sentence id="581">By throwing me out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, he had uh really saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="582">To make a long story short uh at the end of September, beginning of October, finally the aktion took place in It was preceded by a request from the Gestapo to Max Glickstern, the Judenrateltester, to furnish two hundred fifty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="583">The rumors said that the two hundred fifty Jews were meant to go for <span class="spatial object">schmeltz</span> (ph) what that means ?. </sentence><sentence id="584">That means for destruction. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I happened to witness a discussion in the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> which took place to form a list of the two hundred and fifty Jews, and it it was a...the discussion which took place...he said look, you have an old uh father up there who is really...why don't you give your father. </sentence><sentence id="586">He said my father. </sentence><sentence id="587">You have an uncle and you have this...why don't you give...and everybody was pointing fingers to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="588">It came to a point where Max Glickstern, he had to really...and I I admired him in that time...had tears in his eyes and said look, fellows. </sentence><sentence id="589">I grew up, I know everyone of...I grew up in this <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">I know every one of you here. </sentence><sentence id="591">I am not going to make a list    of two hundred and fifty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="592">I am going to say to the <span class="populated place">community</span> hide. </sentence><sentence id="593">Whomever it will, it will hit it will hit but I'm not going to make. </sentence><sentence id="594">And he left the meeting. </sentence><sentence id="595">So now everybody was finishing or starting to to to uh because everybody knew it is it is...the end is near and uh the result of that aktion was really disastrous. </sentence><sentence id="596">It wasn't two hundred and fifty. </sentence><sentence id="597">It ended up around fourteen hundred were taken and it explains to a large degree what has been discussed so many times in the last years. </sentence><sentence id="598">Was it correct or was it right or was it fair from the Judenrat or the Judeneltester...I just read the book about Rumkovski, the chief of the <span class="populated place">Lodz ghetto</span>, you know, to give out in order to save the community a certain number of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="599">Here Max Glickstein had re...had refused to give out two hundred fifty and later we asked ourselves the question...if he would have given the two hundred and fifty, you know, there would have remained uh fourteen hundred still there. </sentence><sentence id="600">But it was a a a question which nobody really could uh answer satisfactorily. </sentence><sentence id="601">Uh some two hundred, hundred eighty or two hundred Jews who whose <span class="region">hiding place</span> were not found, were uh were uh survived. </sentence><sentence id="602">I witnessed one scene where a uh a tailor by the name of Singer

<span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="999">Uh to make a long story short, when we met in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> at our hiding place, it turned out to be

</sentence><sentence id="1007">We ran in different directions. </sentence><sentence id="1008">We lost each other and Gusti and I ended up together out in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Meantime it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1010">We didn't have where to go. </sentence><sentence id="1011">I'm reminded now the promise which Mr. Zarevski, the

wife there and uh was hard to get there. </sentence><sentence id="1014">It was outside...he he tried to keep a very low profile, being Polish and I...then later I understood why. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Because it turned out he was a member of the underground, the <span class="building">Polish underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1016">When I knocked on his <span

we...in the <span class="interior space">attic</span> there was something which looked like a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> as if somebody had slept. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I understood why he brought us there. </sentence><sentence id="1040">That means if somebody would find out that Jews are there, he could say he didn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence
