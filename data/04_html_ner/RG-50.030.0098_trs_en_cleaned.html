were staying, hiding, there was girls you know, girls, and they were...uh...had boyfriends. </sentence><sentence id="180">So Sunday morning the boys came to visit the girls. </sentence><sentence id="181">And the Jews came out from out of the <span class="env feature">hills</span> to...to sit on the sun to warm up. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were freezing. </sentence><sentence id="183">They were cold. </sentence><sentence id="184">They were wet. </sentence><sentence id="185">So they were sitting under the <span class="env feature">trees</span>, under the sun, and we could, you know, on the top of the <span class="building">barn</span> where...where there was, you know, between the <span class="env feature">woods</span> you could see. </sentence><sentence id="186">So when they...they came to visit the girls, they noticed that Jews are hiding or sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="187">So they went and they took a piece of wood, you know, long thing, you know, wood. </sentence><sentence id="188">Went up and they were killing all the Jews, beating on them and killing. </sentence><sentence id="189">And those horrible screams. </sentence><sentence id="190">It still is in my ears. </sentence><sentence id="191">Those screams. </sentence><sentence id="192">Please...they begged. </sentence><sentence id="193">They were screaming. </sentence><sentence id="194">There was a lot of children and crying and screaming. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="196">Unbelievable! </sentence><sentence id="197">So I told my mother...I start feeling a little better. </sentence><sentence id="198">I said to my mother, I said, "Look, whatever is going to happen, it all...my father and all rest of the family and all the rest of the Jews has to happen with us. </sentence><sentence id="199">We're not staying here. </sentence><sentence id="200">We have to go down. </sentence><sentence id="201">We have to go. </sentence><sentence id="202">We have...otherwise, they're going to kill us like....you see what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="203">Those kids...those screaming, those crying. </sentence><sentence id="204">They killed them to death." </sentence><sentence id="205">So the next day, we decided we gonna volunteer go down into the <span class="populated place">town</span>, walk down to the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh...I was very weak so my mother said...uh...whoever asked us where we're coming from...uh...she's bringing me from the <span class="building">hospital</span>...and there was a <span class="building">hospital</span> in another <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">So slowly, slowly, you know, we walked down and took us hours, but I...I had to rest because I was very...uh...nobody would have anything to do with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="208">So one time we stopped exactly like I said with my father how they lived...lived together. </sentence><sentence id="209">We lived...they lived liked brothers. </sentence><sentence id="210">So...uh...sit down on his front, you know, the <span class="dlf">steps</span> where you into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">At least my mother...my mother carried a few stuff, a few things on her back, you know, blankets, some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="212">She carried some stuff with her and he...he came out with a piece of wood and he said...uh...he took that stuff from my mother and he said, "You're not going to use...be able to use that. </sentence><sentence id="213">They're going to kill you...before I kill you. </sentence><sentence id="214">Let..". </sentence><sentence id="215">So he wanted ...uh...you know, kill us, beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="216">He said, "Don't...I want...I don't want to see you here. </sentence><sentence id="217">Don't sit here. </sentence><sentence id="218">He wouldn't let us sit." </sentence><sentence id="219">So we had to walk further. </sentence><sentence id="220">That's..that's why I...every time I remember, you know, I say that...uh..how you live together with friends and everything, but your best friend was your worst enemy. </sentence><sentence id="221">And it's true. </sentence><sentence id="222">And so we finally came down, walked down to <span class="populated place">town</span> and there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> coming with the rest...some more Jews. </sentence><sentence id="223">And we went up on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and they took us to...uh...<span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and not the same <span class="populated
