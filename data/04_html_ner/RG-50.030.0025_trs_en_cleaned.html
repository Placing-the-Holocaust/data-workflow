her go from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, because it will be very bad." </sentence></p><p><sentence id="24"> And that's what -- when they went, they came, the S.D. and the S.S., and

</sentence><sentence id="166">This was -- I think this was already after the winter. </sentence><sentence id="167">The winter was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="168">In <span

</sentence><sentence id="183">We had many things. </sentence><sentence id="184">And they paid to a Polish man what he was bringing the bread to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to the

</sentence><sentence id="193">One of the <span class="building">house</span>, one Jewish family, the Bielskis. </sentence><sentence id="194">And they had, I think, about 10 brothers and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="195">And his sister was married to uncle of mine, but I never knew him, too. </sentence><sentence id="196">It was great uncle, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="197">And she said -- she was too, in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And she said to him, "You know what, I saw by the Boldos" a beautiful girl, and I would like you to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: ...and they were taking away the food from them. </sentence><sentence id="574">And that's what we had the food for the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="575">We made ambush on them and got their rifles. </sentence><sentence id="576">We got everything from them. </sentence><sentence id="577">Nobody was sending us. </sentence><sentence id="578">They were killing the German. </sentence><sentence id="579">They took away the food, took away the rifles, and we were in business. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="589">A: The <span class="populated place">villages</span> told us everything. </sentence><sentence id="590">Not us, to the Bielskis brother.

that he will touch something, whatever, you will not do the right thing, they will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="593">So they did everything. </sentence><sentence id="594">They were telling us that in a couple of days they have to pay to the German so much and so much. </sentence><sentence id="595">Not in money, but in food. </sentence><sentence id="596">So the Bielskis knew that the food is coming. </sentence><sentence id="597">The <span class="populated place">villages</span> are giving them. </sentence><sentence id="598">We need it, too, the food. </sentence><sentence id="599">So

the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, remember one thing, you giving them because you don't want, because Germans, too, they were killing them. </sentence><sentence id="603">They were killing them. </sentence><sentence id="604">They put everything on a fire and they went away. </sentence><sentence id="605">So you have to give them, half them and half to us.

</sentence><sentence id="615">First of all, because we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="616">Second, because we knew better the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and we knew the people. </sentence><sentence id="617">So this was a plus, a big plus for us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="618">And they were saying that we are taking away all of the food. </sentence><sentence id="619">Remember 1,000 people in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="620">You have to feed them. </sentence><sentence id="621">And they were not sitting all of them in one place. </sentence><sentence id="622">We had afraid for that. </sentence><sentence id="623">So in groups, this was about 20 people in groups, they were sitting in the  summertime up. </sentence><sentence

see. </sentence><sentence id="626">So we were very careful, but you know you cannot take away from the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">They knew very good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="628"> The Bielskis knew the place, but they knew, too. </sentence><sentence id="629">So we have to be in peace with them. </sentence><sentence id="630">You cannot take away everything. </sentence><sentence id="631">You have to leave them, too, for the family, something. </sentence><sentence id="632">But we managed. </sentence><sentence id="633">We managed.

said, "Remember Mr. Bielski -- brother Bielski, remember one thing, this is life. </sentence><sentence id="655">You have to fight for them -- for that." </sentence><sentence id="656">Not once my husband -- My husband was always between the German and the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="657">The Polish, they were working together with the German, the Kozaks. </sentence><sentence
