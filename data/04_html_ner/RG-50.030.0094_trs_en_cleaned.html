<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: Yes, my grandparents were living. </sentence><sentence id="2">That is to say uh I I got to know and meet one from each side of the family. </sentence><sentence id="3">Uh I knew my grandmother Dana (ph) who was my father's mother, and even better I knew my mother's father, whose name was Jacob Kramer and uh he lived with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Could you tell me what your early childhood was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, my early childhood was not unusual for an immigrant family. </sentence><sentence id="10">Even though I was born in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, I was barely born in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">My parents escaped from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> earlier the same year that I was born which was 1933.And uh they settled in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> at at for them a very bad time. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was the midst of a de...depression and uh they could barely escape with what little possessions they had. </sentence><sentence id="13">They were relatively young married couple so they had a hard time economically and as I say they they worked together pretty well. </sentence><sentence id="14">And my father stitched together little bit of this and a little bit of that so that they could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="15">And so actually I was raised more by my grandfather in in that period of my life than by either parents and I liked my grandfather a whole lot better for that reason because since my father worked out of the <span class="building">home</span>, why it was always shush here and shush there and don't touch and and make scarce. </sentence><sentence id="16">And grandfather, Opa (ph) I called him, Opa Kramer, uh he took time. </sentence><sentence id="17">He had the time. </sentence><sentence id="18">He was retired so uh he dragged him around with him and really had more of an influence probably on my early education, <span class="building">preschool</span>, than my parents. </sentence><sentence id="19">I remember usually in the mornings, he would take me to the <span class="dlf">playground</span> just to get away from being under foot at <span class="building">home</span> and in the afternoon he'd take me to his pinochle game. </sentence><sentence id="20">So the mornings he made like a child and in the afternoon I made like a grandparent and sat very quietly on the <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">I watched the old, old men, all refugees from <span class="country">Germany</span>, play pinochle and drink tea and tell stories and that's how I grew up bilingual, at least bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="22">Uh my father was in a in a very international type of of occupation and there were always people from all over coming to our <span class="building">house</span> because that's, as I said, where my dad conducted his business. </sentence><sentence id="23">Early in the morning already, my mother was an excellent hostess. </sentence><sentence id="24">She made, was well-known for her breakfasts so people who came in on the morning <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> would come in and sit down at our at our <span class="spatial object">table</span> and and uh talk, chit chat, and talk business. </sentence><sentence id="25">My This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="26">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="27"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection father was an excellent linguist. </sentence><sentence id="28">He was equally at <span class="building">home</span> in German and in French and in Italian and in Dutch, and his English was quite good as well. </sentence><sentence id="29">He has a classical education. </sentence><sentence id="30">He spoke uh uh could could certainly read fluently Latin and Greek, so it it was a very actually lively I would say and international experience that I was exposed to. </sentence><sentence id="31">So even though my father had a very strict rule because he was really upset that uh the <span class="country">country</span> that he loved so dearly, <span class="country">Germany</span>, went for such for such crazy and criminal theories and activities as took place under Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="32">He had a very strict rule. </sentence><sentence id="33">No German. </sentence><sentence id="34">Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="35">They uh, my father went to to the trouble of translating German nursery rhymes and songs, children's songs he didn't know any Dutch ones and I don't why he didn't take the trouble to learn. </sentence><sentence id="36">Maybe that's hard for parents. </sentence><sentence id="37">At any rate uh the way out that he choose was he kept uh the German songs and nursery rhymes and just translated them. </sentence><sentence id="38">And uh made my mother uh sing or recite the translations. </sentence><sentence id="39">Which she did faithfully while he was around but it was much easier for her to do it in the original German, and so I learned them both ways, and of course my grandfather didn't pay any attention to what made my father said about that and uh as soon as we were out of ear shot, that was the language he talked to me. </sentence><sentence id="40">So as I say I was really raised bilingual and bicultural. </sentence><sentence id="41">But that had to be subrosa because we had to hide it from my dad because the the outside effect that we were to give is that we were a Dutch family and uh he wanted to forget about ever having been German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Can you describe the changes in your family life and in the daily routine after the Nazis invaded the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> but efore you left <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="81">Well, of course, things went very much in stages. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think a lot of people who've who've lived through that have have explained it pretty much the same way. </sentence><sentence id="83">Uh the Germans, the Nazis, and it's hard to make that distinction, uh because the Nazis swept everyone along with them, uh the Germans when they invaded the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> uh were an occupying power and in in the beginning made a real effort I think to kind of get the population on their side. </sentence><sentence id="84">So uh our first reaction when we saw that <span class="country">Holland</span> was uh going to be lost from the standpoint of of the fortunes of war, uh my father tried to pack up the family and we went, we jumped in a <span class="spatial object">taxicab</span> that he managed to secure This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="85">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="86"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection somehow, and uh drove across the narrow neck of the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> to the <span class="populated place">harbor city</span> of ,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were happening, things that were happening that segregated out the Jews and that I was one of them and that I was in trouble. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the events leading up to your departure from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="99">Right. </sentence><sentence id="100">Well, uh as I say, tightening the screws was done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they first pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad, who was very much in the public eye uh giving lectures at <span class="building">public museums</span>, going to auctions and so forth, couldn't openly do that anymore. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="101">So I uh I heard it's hard to know after all I was six, seven years old it's hard to know what I remember and what I'm reconstructing from what people tell me but I think I was very well aware that my father was uh having troubles with his business and where these troubles were coming from, that he had to do double bookkeeping and work out tricks with his friends so they could stay on in business and make it appear that he really was not. </sentence><sentence id="102">Uh they actually came to raid our place several times. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="103">First they came for silver and gold and the usual things that uh that they that they liked to steal, which was always done in very formal way, with receipts and stamps and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh and uh later on they came by <span class="dlf">stages</span> to steal my dad's art collection which was his stock for for his <span class="building">dealership</span> in in art, and I remember the first time they came around they they sent the <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> police. </sentence><sentence id="105">Those people must have really been in a very you know almost untenable position because they didn't want to do this. </sentence><sentence id="106">But they were made to do it and they had to work somehow and they were the police. </sentence><sentence id="107">They were taken over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">So I remember when they came, my dad was out. </sentence><sentence id="109">He wasn't even supposed to be out of the <span class="populated place">city</span> because he wasn't even allowed to ride <span class="spatial object">public transportation</span> anymore in those days. </sentence><sentence id="110">So uh mother made up a story as to where he was, and uh the police did everything they do to to calm her down they said don't worry about it uh, we don't even like to do this job but we have to do it, and they said if there is anything particular you'd like to do before we start our work, that's fine. </sentence><sentence id="111">Now this was a hint to her that if she wanted to make one of those <span class="spatial object">paintings</span> that they knew were were around disappear, they wouldn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="112">But you didn't know who you could trust, so here again I'm telling you part of what I remember, part of what I reconstruct but I still remember my mother taking one of those paintings, a little </sentence></p><p><sentence id="113"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="114">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="115"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="116"> one, and just letting her coat drop over it and see what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="117">And they pretended like it wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="118">So gradually every time she'd pass through the <span class="building">house</span> she she pushed that that painting further and further until she finally pushed it into a <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">Then they came and listed everything on official forms and sealed it in the <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">Put the seal of the city of <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> on our on our <span class="interior space">hall closet</span>, and that was the end of my dad's stock. </sentence><sentence id="121">Most of it they didn't get, but they got four or five good <span class="spatial object">paintings</span> which we've tried to in the interim to get back, unsuccessfully. </sentence><sentence id="122">The stuff that we got back was all saved for us by friends and neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="123">But uh the stuff that was confiscated, including my own <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, we never got back. </sentence><sentence id="124">And how people can sit with wellknown pieces of art, because my dad dealt in good stuff, that they know is stolen, this very day is hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="125">So you know the Holocaust goes on because people did not make restitution, not in a general way. </sentence><sentence id="126">But the your question was what changed? </sentence><sentence id="127">Well, uh what what changed then uh is that the action against property changed to action against people. </sentence><sentence id="128">Now first they called up the the young folks and they told them, I remember I had a uh friend of the family that that played with me quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh he was he was called up and he was glad to go because in the beginning it was not at all clear what was happening to people that were being called up for uh work related uh for war related work in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">They told these folks uh, come work for us a half a year and we'll let you go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And so the kids were were anxious to go. </sentence><sentence id="132">And they went willingly. </sentence><sentence id="133">Sent letters back, sent letters back on a regular basis. </sentence><sentence id="134">And when the letters stopped coming my parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="135">They knew even though nobody ever really said this out loud. </sentence><sentence id="136">So it was still a surprise the first day when they started picking up people in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">And my father ran into one of those uh <span class="dlf">street</span> raids but fortunately he had a lot of friends and uh one of the <span class="building">stores</span> that he was dealing with, one of the <span class="building">neighborhood stores</span>, the storekeeper pulled him off the <span class="dlf">street</span> and says you don't want to go there. </sentence><sentence id="138">They're loading up Jews. </sentence><sentence id="139">So he had he hid him behind the <span class="spatial object">counter</span> and then after after curfew the Germans set an eight o'clock curfew on Jews in those days uh he slipped <span class="building">home</span> and thought that that things were at least in the short run going to be better when they made a night raid on our <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And uh my dad was trapped, because uh it was very clear that they were coming at us from all sides, and uh that there was, that you couldn't just walk away from it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141">So my dad decided to go out over the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and you know one of one of the real uh high grabbing experiences that that I have to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="142"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="143">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="144"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection deal with is that I heard him discuss what some of the options were. </sentence><sentence id="145">His friends came over because they were worried. </sentence><sentence id="146">People took took risks. </sentence><sentence id="147">They, Dutch people supported their Jewish friends, discussed what the options were, decided to go up over the <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">I had been told over and over again, don't go on the <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And, but I knew just how to climb out the <span class="dlf">window</span> and get on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and I knew he was going to do that and try to escape over the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and I was really worried. </sentence><sentence id="150">Nobody said word one to me, except they suddenly noticed I was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="151">Somebody grabbed me, pushed me in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, pulled the covers over me even though I was protesting that I didn't put on my pajamas yet, and said you be quiet and you act like you're asleep. </sentence><sentence id="152">And uh just about that time I heard the uh raiding parties stomp up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">They, they the the real Nazis did everything they did loud, so you could always tell when they were Nazis and Nazi sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="154">They would "Hail Hitler" real loud, and they had that opportunity cause we, unfortunately, had downstairs neighbors that were Nazi sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="155">When theysaw those raiders coming in, they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and spent a lot of time hailing and and shouting at each other in the <span class="interior space">hall</span>, which was good cause it gave my dad extra time to get out. </sentence><sentence id="156">Finally they stomped up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>, stomped on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">Finally one of my dad's friends let them in and quite innocently asked what they wanted, and although they screamed real loudly that they were looking for my dad and where was he and uh you know I heard my mother try to explain that she didn't know, maybe he had been picked up in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> she didn't know where my dad was. </sentence><sentence id="158">And I heard them get madder and madder at my mom and finally tell her that they were taking her. </sentence><sentence id="159">And uh so they did. </sentence><sentence id="160">They barely gave her a chance to take her <span class="spatial object">purse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh they dragged her off and put her in one of their <span class="spatial object">paddy wagons</span> and hauled her off. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="162">Well, you said how, how did it happen then that you left <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="163">Well, uh things were formal and crazy at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="164">There were rules for everything which were frequently broken and were up to the whim of which ever commander was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="165">My mother was taken to a <span class="building">theater</span> which was uh known as the <span class="country">Holland</span> , uh which which later became known as the  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="166"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection comfort and and support for the people that had been arrested, detained or whatever word you want to use. </sentence><sentence id="167">And uh my mother called him over and said hey uh Fritz, is there any way we, I I can get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="168">And he said well, he says I know that your dad has done, well, she he would have said of course your husband, uh I know that your husband has done work for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">They're letting people off sometimes uh that whose relatives worked for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">Why don't you try that? </sentence><sentence id="171">And so, uh through Fritz we we got a letter in the right format saying that my dad had done work as a teacher for the for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>, and uh was the was the famous commander, infamous commander of of that uh particular operation, let my mother go. </sentence><sentence id="172">The only one he let go that day. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173">So that's why I say things were very arbitrary. </sentence><sentence id="174">That day he decided to honor that particular rule. </sentence><sentence id="175">So I mean my parents couldn't have it dramatized very much more uh extremely that it was time to get out of there, but where to go. ( </sentence><sentence id="176">Cough) My my parents had one real close uh couple who were their friends whom they had asked already prelude to that time to kind of scout around a little bit and just find anything that might work to get us out of there. </sentence><sentence id="177">And that was just in the beginning of some negotiation with with with them, very shadowy group uh who had had one front person by the name of drink a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, the hardest part I think for my parents in the leaving was that they had to leave my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="179">He was uh getting senile and diabetic and there was no question of making the run with him, so they left him in an <span class="building">oldage home</span> and it was very hard for us to leave him. </sentence><sentence id="180">Of course, they didn't tell me that we that we were going on the run. </sentence><sentence id="181">They told me that we were going on vacation, which was credible since it was August, the big vacation month in <span class="country">Europe</span>, and they said well, we're just going to go on vacation to this new friend of ours, Mr. Hayward, and uh you can play with his kids and uh and we hope we'll have a pretty good time. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh I didn't believe that but I also didn't have the nerve to ask what was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="183">And you know, later on I've I've given a lot of thought to this. </sentence><sentence id="184">Do you tell your kids what goes on if it's if it's tough news? </sentence><sentence id="185">And I've come to the conclusion that you do at least you tell a tenyear old. </sentence><sentence id="186">I was eight then. </sentence><sentence id="187">You tell an eight year old because eight year olds understand a whole lot. </sentence><sentence id="188">You don't need to tell them all the nitty gritty details, but you do need to tell them what's going on, because one of one of the most difficult things for me is the confusion. </sentence><sentence id="189">Hearing one thing and seeing another. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="190">Knowing that my parents were telling me stories. </sentence><sentence id="191">Don't want to say lies because they probably thought they were protecting me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="192">Certainly thought that they were protecting me. </sentence><sentence id="193">But it was no protection. </sentence><sentence id="194">It was crazy making. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was crazy making. </sentence><sentence id="196">And we stayed uh with the the <span class="building">Haywards</span> a couple of weeks until the Nazis raided the place, and they lost their nerve, and they didn't have any alternatives ready, so those were very difficult weeks from uh oh from mid-August to uh mid-September when uh we just wandered the <span class="region">countryside</span> from one <span class="building">temporary shelter</span> to another until we finally wound up in the <span class="building">bath house</span> of a uh <span class="building">retreat center</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">It sounds too fancy it was just a little place out in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> uh operated by a Catholic order and it uh was not being used for anything particular at the time some some came their from time to time to go swimming. </sentence><sentence id="198">We  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="199"> hear the leaves crackle and twigs crack didn't hear anything. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="200">Suddenly the kid was there, and there was our food and then he would slink away and disappear. </sentence><sentence id="201">Well, this was obviously not anything that could go on. </sentence><sentence id="202">In fact one of the things that I remember is how extremely worried my dad was. </sentence><sentence id="203">We were having beautiful September weather, unusual for the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> nice warm sunny afternoons where we could go swimming. </sentence><sentence id="204">I mean it was great, in the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> right uh we had to go swimming actually cause we at that time had only uh the clothes that that uh that we carried with us on our back because we were on the move so much and uh while Dad and I went swimming uh my mother and the lady in the other couple that was hiding with us, uh did the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> in the other end of the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">Uh but as I was starting to say, my dad was complaining about the good weather cause he says how long can this weather last. </sentence><sentence id="206">When the cold weather comes, we'll freeze here. </sentence><sentence id="207">There was of course no way to heat the <span class="building">bath house</span> of a of a of a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> anda remote <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">So you know, when fall weather comes, particularly sunny weather, I find myself getting very uncomfortable and I have to remind myself you know, that that harks back to these times and I'm only recently able to enjoy beautiful fall weather because I keep telling people the bad (ph) winter is going to come. </sentence><sentence id="209">Now the the that is un a very bad position we were in because I, it was quite clear that these adventurers we, we tend to want to see people in terms of good or bad but that doesn't always work. </sentence><sentence id="210">These uh these people that Ari Hayward put us in contact with were good/bad. </sentence><sentence id="211">They probably had some good motivations and uh from most of the stories that I hear about them repeated talk about how much money and when are you going to pay us and so on. </sentence><sentence id="212">They were in it principally for the money. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213">And they were in a bad place because they couldn't deliver. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="214">They had gotten their deposit I am now reconstructing uh it's very clear that they had gotten their deposit but uh my father and and his friend uh Heinz Graumann who with also a wife and son was hiding along with us I didn't trust him at all. </sentence><sentence id="215">I didn't give him any more money than he could get away with. </sentence><sentence id="216">I remember those discussions. </sentence><sentence id="217">And uh it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="218">There's a Dutch proverb that says little pictures have big ears. </sentence><sentence id="219">Uh this little picture had very big ears because I tried to find out as much as I could about what was going on because nobody was going to be telling me anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh these people there, then these adventurers were in a bad way. </sentence><sentence id="221">What were they going to do with us? </sentence><sentence id="222">And as we know reconstructed, they decided to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="223">It had a number of advantages. </sentence><sentence id="224">First of all they knew

hold of us they would do more, they would do worse than kill us, and secondly since they had already figured out where Heinz and my dad were were keeping their money, they could get paid instantly and not have to take any more risks with us. </sentence><sentence id="229">So uh at the at that very time however the regular <span class="interior space">Dutch underground</span> was starting to make some contact with that nebulous group of adventurers, and uh while they were exploring ways to get rid of us, they also explored a way of handing us over to the regular <span class="interior

class="spatial object">bed</span> with me it was obvi...it was quite common in poor uh families for several kids to sleep together, but that was not the usual way that I slept. </sentence><sentence id="231">And the other two kids had the measles too I think, and so they they stuck them, he stuck them, all three of us, in in one of the <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span>, and put a big sign on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, "Quarantined", and so when the search party came through, he says feel free to look anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="232">I've got nothing to hide he says, but don't go in there. </sentence><sentence id="233">I've got some really sick kids in there, and the doctor put a sign on there "quarantined." </sentence><sentence id="234">I don't want you guys to get sick. </sentence><sentence id="235">So well after they made a perfunctory look inside and they say three real sick kids in there, threw the <span class="dlf">door</span> closed, and uh you know, he got us through just by talk. </sentence><sentence id="236">And even though he had some very very good places that he tried at various place, at various times to hide us, the most interesting one was a <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">In order to picture how the <span class="dlf">double wall</span> functioned, you have to you have to picture a very primitive <span class="building">farmstead</span>, and the <span class="building">farmsteads</span> in in <span class="country">Holland</span> uh from an earlier era like this one dated from, had the animals and the people under one <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">The people would live up front, and the animals would be in the back. </sentence><sentence id="239">Very convenient if you go milking cause you just open up a <span class="dlf">door</span> and you're in the <span class="building">stable</span> and you can milk the cows and bring the milk right into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">In fact that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="241">Well, in this <span class="dlf">wall</span>, they had they had two <span class="dlf">walls</span> then one separating the <span class="building">house</span> from the main part of the <span class="building">stable</span> and then another separation between the cows and the horses. </sentence><sentence id="242">And that's where they built the <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">And he had a friend, a uh a bricklayer come in, and duplicate the the <span class="dlf">wall</span> that was already there exactly as it was uh oh about maybe uh a couple of feet away, and uh then to get to that place they would hoist us up to the <span class="dlf">rafters</span> and let us down with a rope so that we'd between the two <span class="dlf">walls</span> and of course there was no <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">Uh these raids always came at the worst times. </sentence><sentence id="245">I remember one time my mother, my mother had a severe case of diarrhea when the alarms came and they hoisted her in there with uh with uh a <span class="spatial object">potty</span> and uh can you imagine those poor people that had to sit there for I think twenty-four hours with someone who had an over-flowing <span class="spatial object">potty</span> of diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="246">Ugh. </sentence><sentence id="247">Fortunately they hid me someplace else that time. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Well, I think I think everybody was quite aware that in order to go, to keep from going stircrazy, you have to keep people busy. </sentence><sentence id="278">And uh the Janssens increasingly gave us work to do. </sentence><sentence id="279">We peeled all their potatoes, and when I say all, potatoes was a staple and uh the Janssens were sheltering not only Jews but at various times various members of their rather extensive family that had moved to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and were running out of food. </sentence><sentence id="280">So there was uh one other <span class="building">chicken house</span> full of people. </sentence><sentence id="281">Uh Harry used to say how fortunate that the Nazis stole all our chickens. </sentence><sentence id="282">This way we can house the people. </sentence><sentence id="283">We can house the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="284">There's another <span class="building">chicken house</span> full and sometimes some of the other <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">I had relatives in them too. </sentence><sentence id="286">So we strung the beans and peeled the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="287">Something that uh people find hard to believe we strung tobacco and <span class="country">Holland</span> is not known as a tobacco raising country, but uh you know, we were talking a little earlier how starved people were for for these cigarettes or anything resembling cigarettes, so they found some variety that would grow there and people took tremendous risks smuggling uh seeds for tobacco which we then grew secretly and strung secretly. </sentence><sentence id="288">There was a lot of secret stuff. </sentence><sentence id="289">I still remember Harry did another thing which was strictly illegal. </sentence><sentence id="290">He butchered. </sentence><sentence id="291">Uh he butchered hogs. </sentence><sentence id="292">And we, and people who farmedwere supposed to deliver all uh animals that were ready for <span class="building">market</span>, all produce to the Germans, which they then shipped east. </sentence><sentence id="293">They didn't give hardly anything to the people in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, which is why there was such a famine there. </sentence><sentence id="294">But uh Harry in contravention of all the rules, slaughtered, and we did that right on the <span class="interior space">kitchen floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">Uh can imagine a little Jewish boy... (laughter)...a scene like that. </sentence><sentence id="296">I had no real sense of where meat was coming from and to see then slit the throat of a hog and string it up from the <span class="interior space">ceiling</span> and cut it up into pieces and make sausage out of the guts that was some experience. </sentence><sentence id="297">But uh it was something that the kids all watched with glee and uh I made a real effort to to fit in. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was hard because you know I was uh a city slicker from the <span class="region">north</span> and they were country bumpkins from the <span class="region">south</span> and they, they not only had a completely different culture, they had a different language. </sentence><sentence id="299">They spoke Dutch but it was such a different dialect that uh if they talked among themselves I couldn't understand a word they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="300">And I knew I was I was a native Dutchman. </sentence><sentence

slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="305">And it was uh kind of a fun thing in a way because the one thing that uh we kids would get out of it immediately was the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">And you will say, what do you do with a <span class="spatial object">hog bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">Well, what you do is you you try to scrape and wash it clean the best you can, and then you take an old <span class="spatial object">tin can</span> and you tie the top of the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span> to the <span class="spatial object">tin can</span> much as you would make a <span class="spatial object">drum</span>, with one difference. </sentence><sentence id="308">You'd also take a stick and you would

can</span>, and then you would tie it taught. </sentence><sentence id="309">Then you would spit into your hands, , and then you would slide it up and down the stick and that was an instrument, an instrument which everybody learned to hate. </sentence><sentence id="310">But uh for uh for uh, what what is this holiday called in English sometimes it's it's hard to translate on the spot uh it's

of Millieure (ph), the playwright because to the <span class="interior space">underground</span> he he got uh in contact with a group of monks across the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span

id="321">He finally wrote a play on the life of Millieure so that's what went on in that <span class="building">chicken house</span>, as hard as it is to believe. </sentence><sentence id="322">Well, with all this literary activities the kids came by to see and my father started uh teaching them uh how to do poetry and how to make drawings and we made skits. </sentence><sentence id="323">I remember one of the neighbors who knew most neighbors knew uh that Harry was hiding refugees was having a fiftieth wedding anniversary and we made the most elaborate uh skit for them, uh a whole

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: Did your, did you get into a routine for for studies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="392">I personally had such a routine where there were at least two or three hours every morning that uh we had subjects that I didn't particularly like and that I don't think my dad was all that interested in either. </sentence><sentence id="393">He was a very literary person. </sentence><sentence id="394">Math and and sciences were not his strong points, so that's what we saved for the morning. </sentence><sentence id="395">But the fun part, the composition, the drawings, the language studies and don't forget geography geography was the overriding interest because you know that's where our salvation was to come from in a literary in the literal sense, so we we traced the Allied troop movement over every inch of <span class="region">North Africa</span> and through <span class="country">Italy</span> and through <span class="country">France</span> until they finally came through <span class="country">Belgium</span> to liberate us, so I I you probably remember when uh the Allied troops first landed in in uh <span class="region">western France</span> they they came to <span class="populated place">Normandy</span> and were stuck there, and I still know all the little hick <span class="populated place">town villages</span> like in <span class="populated place">Normandy</span> where these battles  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="building">collection shelter</span> got partly built that that never came came up. </sentence><sentence id="396">One time they tried digging a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> under a <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> for me. </sentence><sentence id="397">That was special for me because it couldn't be uh so big that other that other people bigger than a nineyear old that I was at the time would fit in. </sentence><sentence id="398">You couldn't hide in the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> because it became known pretty quick that when they did a raid they always ran uh sabers and bayonets through <span class="spatial object">haystacks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="399">If they came up with blood they knew they caught somebody. </sentence><sentence id="400">So, but under the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> was the variation that was the worst night I think I ever spent in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="401">That was awful, in the cold clammy dark place under that <span class="spatial object">haystack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">Uh I complained very little, but they never did that again because I I did complain and that was really awful. </sentence><sentence id="403">Uh other times when there was little advanced notice we would just hide in the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and plenty of <span class="dlf">ditches</span> to hide in in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> and uh in a dry, in the drier season that gives you quite a bit of cover and mobility cause if you can get some sense of which way the raid is going you can constantly keep cover and and keep on the move. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Were the raids frequent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Well, uh I am reconstructing that there must have been four that actually reached the place and maybe three or four others in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> which were just as bad from the standpoint of getting everybody all excited because you never knew are they going to come to your <span class="dlf">farm</span> or not, but uh there was a Nazi sympathizer unfortunately that uh lived across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">Again it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="422">You know, as I told you before, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. </sentence><sentence id="423">Uh my hunch is uh that this fellow like like many people who who played with the Nazis was more interested in being important than being disloyal and uh you know, an occupying force, especially a loud and oppressive one, has a certain amount of attraction to it, and uh there was an element, there's a type of of a personality I think that gets attracted to this and wants to go over to them and and tell them something that they don't already know, and get pat on the back and be told you're a great citizen and great supporter of the new order. </sentence><sentence id="424">Uh and uh it is pretty clear that uh that the that the neighbor across the <span class="dlf">street</span> told on us which is breaking ranks with with all the rest of the people around who who did know. </sentence><sentence id="425">And uh after liberation Harry really confronted this guy according to what uh his wife This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="426">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="427"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Nina (ph) told me later, until he had this guy on his knees in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> begging for mercy. </sentence><sentence id="428">I mean there were that kind of strong feelings about but uh that is how come there were specific raids on our place. </sentence><sentence id="429">I mean there were there were really actual fingers pointed at Harry and that he was able to keep cool under those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="430">One day he payed played cards to, in the first raid as a matter of fact, he carried off by playing cards. </sentence><sentence id="431">He and his friend Marinus (ph) who were who was his closest friend and who was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> with him, uh had gotten notice that uh that we were going to be raided with very little advanced notice. </sentence><sentence id="432">Took us out to this <span class="building">barn</span> in the <span class="region">outback</span> like I told you, and then he and Marinus uh uh got together some drinks and uh spread the card, cards out you know moments before the raiding party came. </sentence><sentence id="433">They they acted like they had been playing and drinking all night, acting completely surprised. </sentence><sentence id="434">What you guys looking here on a on a strange night like this? </sentence><sentence id="435">Well, we were told to make a search. </sentence><sentence id="436">Search for what? </sentence><sentence id="437">Well, you know, that conversation went on like that till they got them into the game where where these two excellent card players first took all their money. </sentence><sentence id="438">To keep interest in it, they let them win some of it back, which you know ate up a whole lot of time, all the time saying oh there's always time to go looking around the place, till they were so drunk and so tired that uh they hardly did any looking around at all. </sentence><sentence id="439">And Harry kept the best uh the best drinks for occasions like this. </sentence><sentence id="440">So he he played his way through a search which is probably also weird in the annals of uh secret operations. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="469">Probably the most supportive thing that he did to help us live through which which was a very difficult situation I mean here we were in this <span class="building">chicken house</span>, right, uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="470">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="471"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection with for for the most part uh no opportunity to go elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="472">One thing he did is he built a uh <span class="dlf">site barricade</span> next to the <span class="building">chicken house</span> out of out of some of sheathes of grain, kind of a <span class="dlf">palisade</span> and uh so we could walk you know short distance like maybe ten feet back and forth outside or sit in the sun and be shielded from the <span class="dlf">road</span> by that. </sentence><sentence id="473">But one thing that he did that I I think was particularly thoughtful and dangerous was to bring in a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, a <span class="spatial object">receiver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">Now you must understand that nobody in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was allowed to have a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">There were certain people who with uh certain people that were deemed trustworthy by the Nazis who could get a permit for a special <span class="spatial object">radio</span> which was constructed so that it could only get two <span class="building">stations</span>, which were the two approved <span class="building">stations</span> that they felt people should listen to. </sentence><sentence id="476">So to get a a regular <span class="spatial object">radio</span> that could listen to anything, <span class="spatial object">shortwave radio</span>, was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="477">But he got one anyway. </sentence><sentence id="478">And dangerous because one can trace <span class="spatial object">radios</span> without making <span class="building">house</span> searches. </sentence><sentence id="479">You can trace apparently whether someone is receiving <span class="env feature">air waves</span> uh electronically. </sentence><sentence id="480">So it was uh a very risky thing to do and uh when my father got over the shock of this very special gift that Harry brought him, he he mentioned that and he says well, how many times can they kill us already. </sentence><sentence id="481">So this was the attitude that that he took and uh so my father really made a business of of listening to the news of of the war and for a while we, he even put together a little underground newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="482">His best source of information was in English but his English wasn't really good enough to to follow uh news broadcasts too well, so he found uh a <span class="building">German station</span> that was giving the uh the <span class="dlf">party line</span>, the German version of how things were going in the war, at dictation speed in English, because apparently this was done as as as kind of a propaganda tool to Englishspeaking peoples, to show them how the Nazis were really winning the war, and so my father could listen to the English broadcasts at dictation speed which was done so that people could copy it down and and you know make little newspapers out of it and uh then would listen to the same broadcast at regular speed, and then he would train his ear so that he could understand the terms that would be used in any kind of a of a broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="483">Then he would listen to the news a third time from the <span class="region">Allied side</span>, get the true story and understand it. </sentence><sentence id="484">There was no paper and my dad scribbled on on the back of old envelopes, in the margins of of diaries, of of tear*off uh uh calendars and everything. </sentence><sentence id="485">I still have some of these pieces of paper very very small, hurried writing, where you could see how he was following the news. </sentence><sentence id="486">But for a time they did manage to uh This is a

we all followed with with great interest ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="490">And that <span class="spatial object">radio</span> stayed with us throughout. </sentence><sentence id="491">I remember

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="714">A: Bad and and getting worse. </sentence><sentence id="715">Because the food situation really was bad and the strain and stress was really telling on the people. </sentence><sentence id="716">I mean I'm reconstructing this afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="717">Uh in the spring of "45 I was really sick and uh that was the time that the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was just starting to be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="718">It wasn't near as dramatic as our liberation because uh the Nazis just faded away at a certain point because their <span class="dlf">supply lines</span> to the east uh had been broken and militarily the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was never forcefully taken. </sentence><sentence id="719">But the famine there was worse than it was in the <span class="region">south</span>.

the story that his father died and then finally they were caught in their own stories, so you know then no one made up makeup stories and I just had to find out on my own that my dad was dead, which

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="914">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your life in <span class="country">America</span> from the time that you came here, where you went to <span class="building">school</span>, and what you ended up doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="916">A: The beginning was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="917">Uh there were there were or if they were they weren't Jews, but we experienced no social service support at all. </sentence><sentence id="918">It was like there was no <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span> from for all they did for the refugees that came in, from my personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="919">My personal experience with the with the <span class="building">Jewish social service agencies</span> was awful. </sentence><sentence id="920">To the extent that they tried to help us they made things worse. </sentence><sentence id="921">Uh they welshed on every agreement that they ever made. </sentence><sentence id="922">Never came through with anything that we expected and we we didn't have anything further to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="923">So what happened is I was just dropped into a regular <span class="building">school</span>, and what English that I knew was pigeon English and English English as we called it then, the American lingo was completely undecipherable

me right now I could understand them fairly well. </sentence><sentence id="927">I could ask questions if I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="928">In the <span class="building">class</span> I couldn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="929">In fact frequently the only thing I understood all day long was the questions they asked me on the materials that they had just covered. </sentence><sentence id="930">Questions directed personally at me I could understand easier than lectures. </sentence><sentence id="931">I just couldn't understand, and it was I was totally frustrated and the adults were totally preoccupied making a living and I was the only little kid because as I said my uncle had his son living with him but he was a grown son. </sentence><sentence id="932">He had just come back from the war. </sentence><sentence id="933">He had his own problems. </sentence><sentence id="934">He had he had uh fought with the American Armies and was just trying to re-stabilize his life, so he didn't have time with me so here I was again, thrown completely on my own resources without anybody to talk to or anybody to help me over this very difficult adjustment to a toa society and the customs and a culture I knew nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="935">Uh I went to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">Uh my second year uh I started I started in the ninth grade which was then in <span class="building">junior high school</span>, but most of my experience was in <span class="building">high school</span> and especially in <span class="building">high school</span> the kids just cut me cold. </sentence><sentence id="937">They were nouveau riche uh American Jewish kids and they didn't want to have anything to do with uh with refugees. </sentence><sentence id="938">And uh the only way in which I made contact was through a <span class="building">drama club</span> and since all of us were acting then and since I was acting all the time anyway I could fit in there. </sentence><sentence id="939">And that's how I got to know some kids my own age and and started making friends, so the <span class="building">drama club</span> was my salvation. </sentence><sentence id="940">I was never a very good actor in the sense of being a thespian but I was a very enthusiastic member of the of the <span class="building">drama club</span>, and thespian is a good word to use because the honor society in that <span class="populated place">community</span> was called the Thespian Society, and the day that they made me a Thespian I knew that I had arrived in some <span class="region">area</span> that I really wanted to be in. </sentence><sentence id="941">After that uh I kind of drifted into <span class="building">college</span> and then drifted into <span class="country">Israel</span>, thinking that maybe that's where I'd like to be, but I didn't feel comfortable there either and besides the <span class="country">U.S.</span> government was sending me threatening letters that if I didn't come back they would call me a draft dodger because at that time everybody had to go into the into the Army, so I came back and I was promptly drafted into the Army, and uh after that I went to <span class="building">graduate school</span> and started working for agricultural companies doing writing,
