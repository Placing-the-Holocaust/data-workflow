Well, I, | remember one thing that my father was an absolutely unreligious. </sentence><sentence id="62">He said he was agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="63">He was in the Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="64">That much what he didn't believe in anything. </sentence><sentence id="65">And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit more religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles. </sentence><sentence id="66">That was about as much religion as I got because my father would take me, say, "Come. </sentence><sentence id="67">Let Mommy give us a blessing." </sentence><sentence id="68">And I went without a word. </sentence><sentence id="69">Then as I grew I went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> because I was a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="70">So it was fun more than religion because I didn't know that I really should be. </sentence><sentence id="71">And then when it came to <span class="building">junior high school</span>, then my father decided to put me in a <span class="building">Reformed Church Protestant school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">And my mother first asked him, "Why you want her to go there?" </sentence><sentence id="73">And my father said, "Because that is the best <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and she will get the best education." </sentence><sentence id="74">And I remembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady principal and she would turn to my father and said, "Mr. Mandl, why do you want your little girl to come to our <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="75">We have no Jewish children." </sentence><sentence id="76">And my father said, "I don't like bigots. </sentence><sentence id="77">I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>." </sentence><sentence id="78">So she smiled and she looked at me, says, "Would you like to come to this <span class="building">school</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="79">And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, "Yes, I do." </sentence><sentence id="80">So then she explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to come to morning services. </sentence><sentence id="81">Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and two songs. </sentence><sentence id="82">And right away I picked up, "I can sing?" </sentence><sentence id="83">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="84">But the Protestant teacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman. </sentence><sentence id="85">She was about six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension! </sentence><sentence id="86">in the <span class="building">school</span> until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and she was the one who taught me about Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="87">And she said, "You have to learn because that was the first religion in the world. </sentence><sentence id="88">And you have to learn some Hebrew." </sentence><sentence id="89">So whatever I know, I know from her. </sentence><sentence id="90">But I was the first and then we got more children so I was there through <span class="building">junior high</span> and <span class="building">senior high</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And I graduated except that I wasn't there on graduation because I got scarlet fever. </sentence><sentence id="92">And I missed the graduation where I was supposed to be a hostess and that hurt me. </sentence><sentence id="93">The only little Jewish kid that could have been the hostess, she couldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="94">But that's how life is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: What about, what about just being a Jewish child, a Jewish teenager in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite wealthy and our <span class="building">house</span> was always open and they -- more Christians and Aristocrats came to the <span class="building">house</span>, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="150">And also we traveled quite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">My mother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there " Boarding-school student (French) This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="152">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="153"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and so we, we went a lot to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and to <span class="country">Austria</span> and to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">And I wasn't <span class="building">home</span> that much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of. </sentence><sentence id="155">So in "36 I was at the -- in <span class="country">Germany</span> at the Olympic games because my very best friend -- and if you ever read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their guest through the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="156">And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running. </sentence><sentence id="157">Flying, not running. </sentence><sentence id="158">And I was so proud and I screamed for him. </sentence><sentence id="159">And it was a very interesting time in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the Nazism as much as they really were. </sentence><sentence id="160">They didn't like the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="161">They didn't like Jesse Owens because he was black. </sentence><sentence id="162">They didn't like some other people because they were another color, like Japanese, but still it was not bad. </sentence><sentence id="163">And we had a wonderful time and I met a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, "What religion you are?" </sentence><sentence id="164">and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time. </sentence><sentence id="165">Coming back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through part of <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion. </sentence><sentence id="167">"You are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="168">We don't want you." </sentence><sentence id="169">But I managed, and I went to <span class="building">Montessori school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">So because of that I happened to go to <span class="country">Italy</span>, and I really had Madam Montessori" teaching me just before she died. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: She was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="199">She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry for today's <span class="building">Montessori schools</span> because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally retarded, to learn to do things by themselves -- to dress by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="200">And today they turned this all out. </sentence><sentence id="201">Today they have <span class="building">Montessori schools</span> where the kids have to be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="202">That is not for our children. </sentence><sentence id="203">The children have to let out. </sentence><sentence id="204">But hers was a natural thing. </sentence><sentence id="205">She didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children. </sentence><sentence id="206">And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="207">And also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to <span class="building">elementary school</span> they are bored. </sentence><sentence id="208">Because in <span class="building">Montessori school</span> most of them already learn how to write, how to count, how to do things. </sentence><sentence id="209">And it makes children very difficult to grow up. </sentence><sentence id="210">But it was a great experience to be in <span class="populated place">Rome</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">I love <span class="populated place">Rome</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">And she lived out in, in a not such a good <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> either, but her whole life was the children and the teaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world. </sentence><sentence id="213">So I do have my Montessori diploma. </sentence><sentence id="214">And then from there I went to <span class="country">England</span> because I wanted to learn the King's English in a real good way and I did. </sentence><sentence id="215">Now, of course, I lost it all. </sentence><sentence id="216">Waited all the &gt; Maria Montessori This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="218"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection years where I lived in different <span class="country">countries</span>, it came off. </sentence><sentence id="219">And after <span class="country">England</span>, I came <span class="building">home</span> and that was already "39. </sentence><sentence id="220">And then I decided I wanted to go to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I'd like to take the Jews off your hand," he said. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And they said, "Yes, Mr. Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1429">You can take 5,000 people." </sentence><sentence id="1430">So he came back to the <span class="building">Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He says, "5,000 and they will never allow me another one." </sentence><sentence id="1432">So that's no good. </sentence><sentence id="1433">So then he designed this Schutz-pass. </sentence><sentence id="1434">And, of course, with 350 people we had millions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the Minister sat and signed each of them. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Now I am afraid you will hear many times they said they were fake papers. </sentence><sentence id="1436">Not one of them were ever fake. </sentence><sentence id="1437">If they say it was too many, yes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably made 50,000 of it. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Alright? </sentence><sentence id="1439">But they were not fake because everyone of them is signed by the Swedish Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1440">What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three years <span class="interior space">Underground</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> and he had a little <span class="spatial object">printing machine</span> and he figured he will come to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and see what he can help there. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And there he had Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed "Danielsson" and 4

called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry. </sentence><sentence id="1446">He said, "You can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="1447">But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, "But if you can save one single life, go ahead and do it." </sentence><sentence id="1448">So very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like Raoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one. </sentence><sentence id="1449">But it was not Raoul's papers. </sentence><sentence id="1450">They were not fake, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And these people just don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1452">He did. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Also, they say he gave us passports. </sentence><sentence id="1454">He never gave passports. </sentence><sentence id="1455">It was a pass, and the pass and if you will read my book, you will see it. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I have it translated. </sentence><sentence id="1457">The picture of the person is on there, with the signature, and it says, "The above, the bearer of this paper is protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings." </sentence><sentence id="1458">And if and when we collectively can go to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, then they will be going and then in <span class="country">Sweden</span> in 14 days this paper will be invalid. </sentence><sentence id="1459">It doesn't say anywhere it's a <span class="spatial object">passport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It doesn't say anywhere that he can take his star off. </sentence><sentence id="1461">It just says he's protected by the Swedish government. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And then when these people had to be shifted out of their <span class="building">houses</span>, then Raoul just picked them up and in these 60 <span class="building">houses</span> we put them in. </sentence><sentence id="1463">These were our <span class="building">safe houses</span> and it was not comfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1464">Raoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to go in the meantime on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Now, on the <span class="dlf">road</span> he didn't take us girls. </sentence><sentence id="1466">He took the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> and he took some of the diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And by that time he called up the Swiss diplomat and said, "Help me. </sentence><sentence id="1468">We need some help. </sentence><sentence id="1469">We need you people doing this." </sentence><sentence id="1470">So then we got the Swiss involved. </sentence><sentence id="1471">We got the Portuguese involved. </sentence><sentence id="1472">We got the <span class="building">Papal Nuncio</span> involved very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And so he had enough men to go with him including Thomas Veres, who was always with him. </sentence><sentence id="1474">He was a young boy with a <span class="spatial object">camera</span> hidden and he made all these pictures. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because they were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul and he would shout, "Raoul, jump. </sentence><sentence id="1476">They're killing you." </sentence><sentence id="1477">And Raoul jumped into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and they left. </sentence><sentence id="1478">But he went out after the people all the way to the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span> to get the people back. </sentence><sentence id="1479">With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="1480">As I said, it was the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't

shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Children, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And Raoul was beside himself. </sentence><sentence

heard that they shooting people into the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And it was December, just before Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And what the Hungarians did -- it was no snow -- it was a no stars, only heavy snowing and the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with huge icicles.

</sentence><sentence id="1818">We had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the <span class="interior space">cave</span>, and every time we had to synchronize. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1821">They were afraid they would be caught. </sentence><sentence id="1822">So we -- when they fell we jumped and thanks to the icicles the rope hang on to the <span

them in, changed them. </sentence><sentence id="1824">Fifty people we saved -- what is nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1825">But it's more than if we had no Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1826">We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we couldn't move anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And then that was over and then we had one more big thing. </sentence><sentence id="1828">When they advertised -- the "lovely" Germans -- that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such and such a <span class="building">palace</span> next morning to clean up <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, we knew again that they will take them right out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1829">So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, "You all have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working in the <span class="region">Buda side</span> in a beautiful <span class="building">villa</span> because as I told you we always had to move our <span class="building">offices</span> and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes. </sentence><sentence id="1830">And there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1831">No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1832">But what was so amazing that it was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice, but moonlit. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows. </sentence><sentence id="1834">Why they didn't come on that night. </sentence><sentence id="1835">Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1836">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1837">The CIA!(r) must have been very good and the <span class="building">Scotland Yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1838">They didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And suddenly Raoul arrived around midnight. </sentence><sentence id="1840">Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said, "Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?" </sentence><sentence id="1841">And so we said, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1842">And then he told us quickly a joke. </sentence><sentence id="1843">He said, "I don't want you to look up, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next <span class="building">villa</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1844">And naturally we all looked up. </sentence><sentence id="1845">He says, "Don't look up. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Just work. </sentence><sentence id="1847">It's only the <span class="building">German Headquarters</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1848">And he did like he didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1849">If Raoul doesn't care if the German has <span class="building">headquarters</span>, why should we, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1850">I mean it was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1851">We were taken over by his strength. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And it was really a feeling, "If he can do it, then we should help him with everything." </sentence><sentence id="1853">So I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I -- he embarrass -- embraced me and he said, "Be careful." </sentence><sentence id="1854">And I said, "Yes Sir, I will." </sentence><sentence id="1855">And I left. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And I remember there was no one around. </sentence><sentence id="1857">I went with the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1858">And I walked across the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> to <span class="populated place">Pest</span> because all my people were on the <span class="region">Pest side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And it was a very emotional going because I had to ring some door bells and some friends of mine came to the

you crazy? </sentence><sentence id="1872">You could have been killed." </sentence><sentence id="1873">Then like Raoul Wallenberg would say, "Get killed? </sentence><sentence id="1874">No way. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Because the Hungarians and the Germans, they're cowards. </sentence><sentence id="1876">They wouldn't be daring to be outside in a curfew." </sentence><sentence

read a few books now, you can put it together what really happened and what he did. </sentence><sentence id="1886">But it was amazing. </sentence><sentence id="1887">So my two girls friend are
