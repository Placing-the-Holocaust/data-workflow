<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">NINA KALESKA January 3, 1990 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: [Born in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, April 11th 1929 (phrases missing)] ...small <span class="populated place">town</span> considering in con...in the context of <span class="populated place">American cities</span>, it was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3">But a <span class="populated place">town</span> that had a lot of educational uh <span class="building">establishments</span> and the opera would, for instance, come and perform. </sentence><sentence id="4">Uh I never traveled very much as a child except for the in into the immediate <span class="region">outskirts</span> and I came from a family where there was a great deal of love and a great deal of concern and a great of care and that continued until our total separation which came actually in 1940... in 1941 for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up? </sentence><sentence id="9">What was <span class="building">school</span> like? </sentence><sentence id="10">What kind of <span class="building">schools</span> did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I have attended a number of different <span class="building">schools</span>, probably because my mother and father were looking at what was the best <span class="building">educational outlet</span> rather than a particular <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">I went to a <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> uh which I didn't like terribly much. </sentence><sentence id="16">and them my sister and I spent about a year or two in <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">There were only five or six children and we had, strangely enough for <span class="country">Poland</span> at that time, uh Hebrew instructions. </sentence><sentence id="18">But there was an excellent <span class="building">private school</span> and then after that I attended a <span class="building">gymnasium</span> (ph) and my formal education per se actually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: What about friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph). </sentence><sentence id="27">She was a champion - champion skater, champion swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="28">She was very musical - played a number of instruments. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was given piano lessons, ballet lessons. </sentence><sentence id="30">I was particularly interested in the <span class="building">theater</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage. </sentence><sentence id="32">So they said to my parents, we're not interested in how well she will do academically. </sentence><sentence id="33">We have discovered that she has a very lovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are going to overlook her theatrical career. </sentence><sentence id="34">And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the major choirs. </sentence><sentence id="35">I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="36">It was just a <span class="dlf">natural outlet</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="37">Uh I played with a lot of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="38">We would invent some wonderful plays. </sentence><sentence id="39">It wasn't a <span class="spatial object">store-bought toy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">We would play <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">We would play uh I remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a lot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would be Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes from our <span class="interior space">kitchens</span> and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that. </sentence><sentence id="42">So we really had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti- Semitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed, blonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, that my parents did, that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="43">But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept asking why, what's what what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="44">It's very hard for parents to explain because we believe in a different religion or we belong to a to a <span class="building">synagogue</span> rather than a <span class="building">church</span> that  people don't like you. </sentence><sentence id="45">And so I grew up both on one level uh happily because I was loved and protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family life was very important and | imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted embedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself, probably helped me a great deal later on to have that <span class="building">base</span>, that strength of knowing who you are. </sentence><sentence id="46">Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that. </sentence><sentence id="47">And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">We lived ina perfectly beautiful <span class="interior space">apartment</span> near the <span class="env feature">river Niemen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="49">Uh my mother was more religious than my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic about it. </sentence><sentence id="50">And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I started to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our <span class="dlf">windows</span> towards 1938, 1939, and uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our <span class="building">home</span>, and my father would, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to go to our <span class="building">home</span> so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children were told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder. </sentence><sentence id="51">And it was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="52">But that's the kink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the catastrophe of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="53">So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it in terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already lingering in the in the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: When did this change? </sentence><sentence id="83">When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in addition to the special <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="84">Were there any other changes from "39 to "41 that you noticed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political uh politics per se, I loved being there at that time because the pogroms have stopped. </sentence><sentence id="89">I was indited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group. </sentence><sentence id="90">They showered a great deal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them. </sentence><sentence id="91">My parents probably were dismayed and couldn't do anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father I believe was imprisoned for about three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know why, but it was obviously for political reasons. </sentence><sentence id="93">He may have said something that did not please the Communist in.. uh people. </sentence><sentence id="94">Now you have to understand <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> is about, I'm not sure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the <span class="dlf">Lithuanian border</span>, or maybe less. </sentence><sentence id="95">So that entire <span class="region">area</span> uh was a changeable <span class="region">area</span> geographically. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was first, my parents were born there or close by and then it was <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">When I was born it <span class="country">Poland</span>, and in 1944 it was <span class="country">Russia</span> again, and it is <span class="country">Russia</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="98">So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939. </sentence><sentence id="99">I speak Poli... spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="100">We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good. </sentence><sentence id="101">We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and I would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other. </sentence><sentence id="102">And of course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages. </sentence><sentence id="103">Well, uh <span class="country">Russia</span>, the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> occupied that part of, well, <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1939 as we know, <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided. </sentence><sentence id="104">Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional  <span class="region">northeastern part</span> went to the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="105">And <span class="populated place">Balystok</span> and <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> and that entire <span class="region">areas</span> became <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">I loved it. </sentence><sentence id="108">I learned White Russian because that is really Bieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics. </sentence><sentence id="109">My sister was the one who really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and dancing and they encouraged that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="110">And life seemed perfectly alright. </sentence><sentence id="111">And then in September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the <span class="building">bonders</span> because the <span class="dlf">air</span> the air raids were pretty severe. </sentence><sentence id="112">And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked up out of the <span class="building">compound</span> and said we've just seen <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">Now again, you have to understand I did not understand the idea what <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span>, what kind of ominous <span class="env feature">clouds</span> that would sweep around <span class="country">Europe</span> and what it would mean, that the <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> are in front of your <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: What did you do when you heard <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span>, when your family heard <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="142">What did you and your family do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: They were very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="144">They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible stories coming out from the other part of <span class="country">Poland</span>, people who may, who escaped uh what was happening to the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">But again I must say that maybe because I was playing with dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in, what the tragedy of the entire period meant. </sentence><sentence id="146">I could only reflect today as I have post- Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="147">When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="148">I was we were ina <span class="dlf">vacuum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">I was in a vacuum. </sentence><sentence id="150">I can only speak for myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than now. </sentence><sentence id="160">Then what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="161">Did <span class="building">school</span> continue for example? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="166">Not in'41. </sentence><sentence id="167">Right. </sentence><sentence id="168">In 1941 <span class="building">school</span> did not continue. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was actually not even the beginning of the <span class="building">school</span> semester. </sentence><sentence id="170">Very shortly after, uh we were still in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, within a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">The <span class="populated place">upper ghetto</span> and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in, not very far from where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="172">And very shortly the entire the entire Jewish population of <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> was being uprooted from their <span class="building">home</span> and that I remember very distinctly and with great pain. </sentence><sentence id="173">We had some beautiful china. </sentence><sentence id="174">We had a very lovely <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">Wasn't rich but it was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="176">The Germans would come in and simply at the whim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw it against a <span class="dlf">wall</span> to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease. </sentence><sentence id="177">And you didn't really have to be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh. </sentence><sentence id="178">We were evacuated to a to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother was one of three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="179">One had come to this <span class="country">country</span> and the other was married to a prominent professor with three children. </sentence><sentence id="180">One of my cousins was a uh young man who I believe was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the Germans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew, and when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="181">His older sister, my other cousin, was a, completed the <span class="building">Warsaw Conservatoire</span> and was a concert pianist and somehow managed to escape to uh to <span class="populated place">Alma Ata</span> in <span class="country">Russia</span> [NB: <span class="country">Kazakhstan</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="182">The younger of the three  cousins uh stayed with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="183">Because my uncle was considered in <span class="populated place">High Intelligentsia</span> they have, they rounded them up and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="184">When were in the second <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I believe my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were with us. </sentence><sentence id="185">We had improvised <span class="building">schools</span> meaning that we still believed that the world may not have gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our studies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and get them together. </sentence><sentence id="186">Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting. </sentence><sentence id="187">My father worked as a forester. </sentence><sentence id="188">That means that he was a specialist in wood and primarily worked with peasants. </sentence><sentence id="189"><span class="country">Poland</span> is known for beautiful <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">He was extremely well liked. </sentence><sentence id="191">He was, I remember my father more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on either - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one. </sentence><sentence id="192">My father came <span class="building">home</span> on day and said that some peasant families said let me have your children for you. </sentence><sentence id="193">They are both very light. </sentence><sentence id="194">They don't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="195">Why don't you let us have them. </sentence><sentence id="196">We will hide them for you. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="198">If we cannot be together then we're not going to be without you. </sentence><sentence id="199">In November of 1942 the second <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where I was with my family got split up. </sentence><sentence id="200">They were obviously starting the evacuation process to the many <span class="populated place">camps</span> that we didn't know anything about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Can we hold it for one minute, (Sure) and I'd like you to describe the life in the first <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="239">What was your daily life like? </sentence><sentence id="240">You mentioned <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">What else was going? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it was bearable. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me. </sentence><sentence id="244">My sister was with me. </sentence><sentence id="245">We tried to improvise and play. </sentence><sentence id="246">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="247">I'm sure my parents felt differently because I was so young. </sentence><sentence id="248">And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on except that somehow we were not at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">We shared a <span class="interior space">room</span> with many other people. </sentence><sentence id="250">Uh life was no normal, but we were still a family. </sentence><sentence id="251">And then very abruptly, as they usually do those things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where they the first <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> - as I said we were in the second <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> - they probably started to, in fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="252">No doubt that the Jews who were in the <span class="region">German part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> had already been evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="253">But this is the <span class="region">eastern part</span> and they you know they had to start a whole new program. </sentence><sentence id="254">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh they rounded us up. </sentence><sentence id="256">We had no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="257">I had no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="258">Maybe the others did. </sentence><sentence id="259">My parents and I, my sister and I and my parents were separated. </sentence><sentence id="260">My sister and I were taken to, by <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to <span class="populated place">ghetto number one</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">We had no idea what happened to our parents. </sentence><sentence id="262">I had subsequently learned that the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, that was, went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they were in a way entered the <span class="populated place">camp</span> as most of them of course did not. </sentence><sentence id="263">My sister and I remained in the first <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">That was already very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was it was wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="266">The selections were, in other words the evacuation process began quite earnestly. </sentence><sentence id="267">We work in a in a <span class="building">tobacco factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">My sister and I would share a kind of little <span class="spatial object">cot</span> in somebody's <span class="building">house</span> and ____ the <span class="building">house</span> the <span class="building">house</span> belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we managed to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec..-uh not selections because they weren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to wherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape. </sentence><sentence id="269">And we  continued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave here and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again. </sentence><sentence id="270">But, on January probably the 18th or 20th, somewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the <span class="building">synagogue</span> which is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were found and walked to the to the to the <span class="building">station</span> and what was so dreadful and I remember that - I did not see Shoah but the told me about that. </sentence><sentence id="272">The people were standing and watching as the people, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously dragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then we saw the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And that's when the reality set in but I still had no idea that a place like <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> existed. </sentence><sentence id="275">That they were still doing the actually burning people. </sentence><sentence id="276">We didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="277">My sister gave me my mother's coat. </sentence><sentence id="278">A long coat, and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> rather than to the <span class="building">crematory</span> right away. </sentence><sentence id="279">My sister was very bright. </sentence><sentence id="280">She was very cleaver. </sentence><sentence id="281">She was absolutely wonderful, tremendously liked. </sentence><sentence id="282">Her name was Sala (ph) and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride was probably one of the worst things that I can possibly remember. </sentence><sentence id="283">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride was utterly horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="284">People died. </sentence><sentence id="285">There was no <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">There were no sanitary facilities. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="288">Whatever was had gone very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was about three and a half days. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then we stopped and we saw <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents. </sentence><sentence id="292">Well, we were right to some extent, except that we didn't meet them. </sentence><sentence id="293">During the time that we were that we came down, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, Sala said to me, don't speak, don't move, let me think for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="294">We were about twenty-five hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="295">I have a book by the way, from somebody from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> who had just published the entire history of the Jews of <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is mentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are documentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">Maybe I was very dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people did. </sentence><sentence id="297">When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the <span class="spatial object">train</span> were being pushed to one side and a rather small group was being pushed to one side, both men and women. </sentence><sentence id="298">She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she followed me. </sentence><sentence id="299">And the guard the guard said, <span class="populated place">Genoch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">There were eight-five women and a hundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">The rest went directly to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">Now we didn't know about that. </sentence><sentence id="303">But after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> which was January, January 24th, 1943, the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span> were very high and the smell of flesh was very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going to meet our parents. </sentence><sentence id="304">So this was my introduction to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">And I suppose you want to know what happened and I will tell you briefly... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Let's slow down a little. ( </sentence><sentence id="371">Alright.) </sentence><sentence id="372">Uh tell me when you arrived into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, where were you taken and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
