<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: It was a very large <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248"><span class="populated place">Lodz</span> was -- I understand there were 250,000 Jews or more. </sentence><sentence id="249">It was a textile in the <span class="dlf">street</span> there and it was called the <span class="spatial object">Polish Mattress Stash</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">And so when some of this -- of the big industrialists in textile were going to our <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was <span class="building">Vininsky</span> (ph), <span class="building">Korn</span> (ph), and others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Oh, we felt it. </sentence><sentence id="260">Somehow we did feel it. </sentence><sentence id="261">We knew that it exist. </sentence><sentence id="262">We felt it much more before -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski. </sentence><sentence id="263">That really felt it and I remember one program. </sentence><sentence id="264">We went to the <span class="building">summer house</span> all the father, I and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the <span class="dlf">window</span> because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there is a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And there was some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it had much to do with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="266">That .... did that answer your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war? </sentence><sentence id="278">See, that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="279">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="280"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 6 <span class="building">school</span> I was going to was a <span class="building">private school</span> and I started the <span class="building">school</span> from the first grade and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had my papers graduation papers. </sentence><sentence id="281">I thought they were very important. </sentence><sentence id="282">Dave, my husband, saw them and when we went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I thought it would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="283">I put it in my <span class="spatial object">stocking</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">But of course, it wasn't helpful. </sentence><sentence id="285">I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, but it's not -- not really important right now. </sentence><sentence id="286">So it was -- it was actually a good life. </sentence><sentence id="287">It was a Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="288">We also had very high morals and ethics. </sentence><sentence id="289">And I remember that when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more assimilated <span class="building">home</span> and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us. </sentence><sentence id="290">They are the perpetrators. </sentence><sentence id="291">Let them be ashamed. </sentence><sentence id="292">Why should we be ashamed to wear the star?" </sentence><sentence id="293">And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my <span class="building">house</span> and we knew much about charity. </sentence><sentence id="294">My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give. </sentence><sentence id="295">It's important how you give." </sentence><sentence id="296">I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help. </sentence><sentence id="297">There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father was bringing from the <span class="building">House Of Prayers</span> a guest which is called the orrach, and he was sitting with us at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to take with him and nobody asked him any questions. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was a charitable atmosphere in our family. </sentence><sentence id="299">For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her daughter says, "Don't let him in anymore." </sentence><sentence id="300">She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed the <span class="spatial object">spoons</span>, he wouldn't have taken them." </sentence><sentence id="301">So considering the high ethics and high morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="302">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="303">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="304"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: One more question about before the war. </sentence><sentence id="337">Were you involved in any political or Zionist organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: I knew of their existence. </sentence><sentence id="341">I knew of their existence. </sentence><sentence id="342">However, in -- in retrospect I know that it was -- actually the right thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="343">Because if you have an idea, no matter how impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it? </sentence><sentence id="344">Because the first there is an idea always and there are deeds following it. </sentence><sentence id="345">But because of the background and because of the <span class="building">school</span> I was not involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="346">I remember a certain time somebody wanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing. </sentence><sentence id="357">They put up some -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: What was the, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="361">What was the date, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September. </sentence><sentence id="365">And some <span class="spatial object">gallows</span> were put on in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as many as possible people would see it. </sentence><sentence id="366">When they entered <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> they somehow wanted to harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our <span class="building">house</span> and they wanted my father. </sentence><sentence id="367">People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="368">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="369"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 8 actual work. </sentence><sentence id="370">Some people were, for instance, bringing <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> up the set <span class="interior space">floor</span> and the others were suppose to take it down and so on. </sentence><sentence id="371">It was just shear harassment. </sentence><sentence id="372">Shear torment. </sentence><sentence id="373">Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father was still going to the <span class="building">store</span> and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was going with him and he called me his angel. </sentence><sentence id="374">I had long brown hair and somehow I was very often able to talk the German out of letting him go. </sentence><sentence id="375">I remember that one time we -- they brought us into a <span class="interior space">court yard</span> and they left. </sentence><sentence id="376">And -- but it was a very frightening time because it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children standing on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it? </sentence><sentence id="377">You know, very often I'm thinking about it. </sentence><sentence id="378">Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the teaching unfortunately of the <span class="building">church</span> which I hope is being changed. </sentence><sentence id="379">But in <span class="country">Poland</span> it will take a very, very long time until it would be changed. </sentence><sentence id="380">I heard somebody saying that he got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother. </sentence><sentence id="381">Because -- and as I understand, that the <span class="building">church</span>, the -- anyhow the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span> since Pope the 23rd, is realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and their changes are -- are going on. </sentence><sentence id="383">I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good heart and I'm glad that there is from the <span class="building">Vatican</span> some directions now to change the liturgy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

done by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="761">The other deportations -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very tragic. </sentence><sentence id="762">So we really did not know for sure

that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible. </sentence><sentence id="778">They say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place" -- and I was sick already
