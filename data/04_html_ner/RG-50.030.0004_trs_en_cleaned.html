<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">ESTHY ADLER May 16, 1994 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: Can you tell us your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Esthy Adler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I think I was born in , <span class="region">East Prussia</span>, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="8">Any of the  including a pair of twins, twin girls, red headed twin girls. </sentence><sentence id="9">I remember. </sentence><sentence id="10">Isn't that funny some of the memories one has? </sentence><sentence id="11">And I remember they spoke a different language and they sort of made fun because I couldn't speak the same language, but it quickly sort of faded because I seemed to have learned enough words to get along. </sentence><sentence id="12">My guess is is that was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and that's when I started learning Polish, really. </sentence><sentence id="13">So, that's some of the earliest memories I have. </sentence><sentence id="14">Then I have another memory of my mother dying. </sentence><sentence id="15">I remember she was ill, but very briefly. </sentence><sentence id="16">I have memories of my mother going out and bringing back donuts, jelly donuts, and I remember hugging her and she had snowflakes on her shoulder and her hair, and that's one of the early memories that I have. </sentence><sentence id="17">I assume it snowed quite a bit in <span class="country">Poland</span>, so I probably had that experience more than once, but I do remember that. </sentence><sentence id="18">Then I remember my mother dying June the 9th and my father bringing me over to my aunt's place, which was in the same <span class="building">building</span> only a different <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and I remember a great deal of upset in my life as a result of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Were you aware that she had died? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="34">My father told me. </sentence><sentence id="35">My father came to get me from my aunt's and told me that my mother had left. </sentence><sentence id="36">I think that's the way he put it. </sentence><sentence id="37">And that I wasn't going to see her anymore and that I had to be very brave. </sentence><sentence id="38">And then I remember a woman moving in with us, somebody who took care and cooked for us. </sentence><sentence id="39">Then still later, I remember my father remarrying, but that's only a vague memory, and I remember my aunt being very disapproving of the marriage. </sentence><sentence id="40">Apparently he made an unsuitable marriage, and I remember always a lot of talk about it behind closed <span class="dlf">doors</span>, and as soon as I walked in there would be silence. </sentence><sentence id="41">I figured there was something wrong with the marriage. </sentence><sentence id="42">She was very young, the woman he married, and she was a very good looking woman and I suppose that didn't go down too well with my mother's sister and her family. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, that's some of the earliest -- and then suddenly a great deal of the war started intruding. </sentence><sentence id="44">I remember being on the <span class="dlf">street</span> once with my father and Germans marching, and my father was holding on to me in such a tight way that I knew there was something wrong that he was tense. </sentence><sentence id="45">You know, how you communicate with children that there is something not quite right and he told me to be very quiet, which I was. </sentence><sentence id="46">I remember the Germans marching and a lot of the people on the <span class="dlf">street</span> applauding as the Germans marched by. </sentence><sentence id="47">I remember going back <span class="building">home</span> and there was a very somber atmosphere suddenly and neighbors kept on dropping in and there were meetings late at night. </sentence><sentence id="48">Sometimes I would hear through the slightly opened <span class="dlf">door</span> that there were people meeting in the <span class="interior space">living room</span>, you know, and talking and sort of making plans on what to do. </sentence><sentence id="49">I knew there was something very menacing going on, but I didn't know exactly what it was. </sentence><sentence id="50">Then the first inkling how menacing it could be. </sentence><sentence id="51">We were at dinner one day and I heard an enormous explosion. </sentence><sentence id="52">The noise, like my heart stopped for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was so close and so loud and I was told that that was a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span> that dropped very closely by. </sentence><sentence id="54">So, that's how it started. </sentence><sentence id="55">That's how I remember the war really. </sentence><sentence id="56">Then I remember people organizing themselves in a hiding place, a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> was made ready for people to go down in case of bombings and in case of raids also by the Germans and the Poles together I assume. </sentence><sentence id="57">I remember very often being woken up and being asked to dress very quickly and very  quietly and everybody was trooping down into the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">After coming out on one of those raids, I wanted to go and see a friend who didn't live in the <span class="building">building</span> but who lived just a couple of <span class="dlf">streets</span> away, and my father said I couldn't go by myself anymore. </sentence><sentence id="59">I used to go by myself. </sentence><sentence id="60">It was just maybe around the corner, a couple <span class="dlf">streets</span> away. </sentence><sentence id="61">So, he took me there and we walked over there and suddenly all I saw was a pile of rubble. </sentence><sentence id="62">Our <span class="building">building</span> was gone, and my friend was gone and everybody in it was gone, and I remember coming back and for the first time feeling very threatened, really threatened, that maybe the same thing was going to happen to our <span class="building">building</span> and to us in the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="63">That was a very threatening moment I remember very distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="64">From the on there was a whole series of raids and bombings which I --it got to a point where I was afraid to go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> you know, because it was very frightening when it happened at night and I felt if I didn't go to sleep maybe it wouldn't happen, but it just kept on happening. </sentence><sentence id="65">On one of those raids we all trooped down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and I remember, there must have been bombs falling all over because the noise was just absolutely deafening. </sentence><sentence id="66">I remember very distinctly that stay in that <span class="interior space">cellar</span> because we ran out of food and water. </sentence><sentence id="67">There were some children, and there was one child who kept on yelling for <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">He sat next to me and that child, that little boy and I remember on one of those occasions when he started yelling his father put his hand on his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="69">I didn't see it because there was no light, but I could feel his arm and the little boy started struggling and kicking and then he just lay very still. </sentence><sentence id="70">My father said you have to be very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="71">You cannot do what he did. </sentence><sentence id="72">You cannot yell or cry or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="73">You do exactly as I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="74">He was telling me that in my ear. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I really did what my father told me. </sentence><sentence id="76">I really learned how to be very quiet, because even though I didn't fully understand what it meant I knew it was something final and terrible that had happened to that little boy. </sentence><sentence id="77">So, I knew that I had to do as my father said. </sentence><sentence id="78">We stayed in that <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, and I don't know for how long because one day they just discovered us and they ripped open the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and they got us all out in German </sentence></p><p><sentence id="79"> , of course, and it was full of lice. </sentence><sentence id="80">It was at night and barking dogs and </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: How old do you think you were? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: I don't know, maybe five, maybe six. </sentence><sentence id="83">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="84">I don't know how old I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you feel close to anybody after your father left at that moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: I was clinging to my aunt, really, because my step mother I hardly knew, and she was not a patient or sort of nurturing kind of person. </sentence><sentence id="91">She was very distant, so I didn't feel comfortable with her, but I was trying to cling to my aunt, but she had two little girls. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, there was a limit of how much she could really do for me. </sentence><sentence id="93">So, I was learning very quickly to be alone, really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: There were other children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: There were some other children of various ages, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: Were you friends with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: I didn't know them. </sentence><sentence id="105">I didn't know those children because I didn't know where they came. </sentence><sentence id="106">I'm not even sure that many of the people who were with in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> survived, because we were there for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="107">My guess is a week, no food no water. </sentence><sentence id="108">That is a long time. </sentence><sentence id="109">I think probably a lot of the elderly died. </sentence><sentence id="110">The men were all taken away. </sentence><sentence id="111">They're weren't that many left, really. </sentence><sentence id="112">Some of them I knew by sight but I really didn't know them well enough and there weren't that many children in that <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">There were my two cousins and that little boy who died and if there were any others I hardly remember them. </sentence><sentence id="114">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="115">So there weren't really. </sentence><sentence id="116">There were other children in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but I didn't know them really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Tell us about the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">What do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: It was out in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was surrounded by <span class="dlf">fields</span> and <span class="env feature">trees</span> and it was obviously <span class="dlf">wheat fields</span>, is that what <span class="country">Poland</span> must have had because that was in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">It must have been <span class="dlf">wheat fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">Also, you know, wood and such and there were mostly <span class="building">barns</span> and people were housed very crowded in and every morning the younger women would be marched out at daybreak into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> to work, and the others were left in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">At night they would come back and we would all congregate on that <span class="env feature">tree</span> where they would bring out some food. </sentence><sentence id="139">Everybody went up. </sentence><sentence id="140">We all had a tin plate or something or wooden plate, even. </sentence><sentence id="141">I don't remember what it was really and we would get something to drink and some soup and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="142">Then, one day they marched the women out as usual and then instead of leaving us in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, the rest of us, the children and the somewhat elderly, people not well enough to march out, they rounded us and they started marching us to one particular <span class="region">wooded area</span> and when we got there we noticed that there were a few men digging a sort of a deep <span class="dlf">hole</span> and then they told us all to line up and I  noticed that they had machine guns lined up across from us and they opened fire on us. </sentence><sentence id="143">Then all we did was sort of topple into that <span class="dlf">hole</span> into that <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">Those of us who weren't hit, fell anyhow because there were so many bodies milling about and I fell in there, and I must have lost consciousness for a while because when I woke up I started moving and I was sort of on top of bodies and there were other people on top of me and I felt some stickiness and I looked and it was blood. </sentence><sentence id="145">I wasn't sure if I was alive or dead, but I sort of sat up. </sentence><sentence id="146">By then there was nobody around, and I sort of climbed out. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was easy enough to climb out because it was on even <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">I climbed out and I sort of ran into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and I sat down in the <span class="env feature">bushes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">There was very thick <span class="env feature">woods</span> and <span class="env feature">bushes</span>, a real <span class="env feature">undergrowth</span>, and I sat down there because it was daylight and I figured I couldn't go out into the <span class="dlf">clearing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">Then I heard a man with a dog coming, one of those big -- and suddenly I looked and there was the man and that huge German shepherd walking towards me and I thought, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="151">I thought that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="152">The German shepherd stuck his head in under the <span class="dlf">branches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">Went like this and stuck his head out and continued with the man. </sentence><sentence id="154">To this day I don't understand what happened. </sentence><sentence id="155">I really don't understand because those dogs were really trained to hunt people, and I don't understand what happened, but they passed and I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="156">I stayed there until it was dark and then I came back to the <span class="building">barracks</span> to where I stayed with my stepmother and everybody wanted to know what happened because everyone realized what had happened, that something had happened, but they didn't know exactly what, and that particular <span class="building">barrack</span>, you know, most of the people in it were missing and there were a few other <span class="building">barracks</span> where probably some survivors had also gone back, but you didn't run back between <span class="building">barracks</span> once you were into your <span class="building">barrack</span>, so everybody asked me what happened. </sentence><sentence id="157">Then it was decided, there was one other little girl who had come back. </sentence><sentence id="158">I didn't even notice her, you know, I didn't even know where she was from, and it was decided that the two of us the next day when the women marched out to the <span class="dlf">fields</span> that we would stay under the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and we weren't going to move until they came back at night, and that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, in the morning when everybody left the <span class="building">barracks</span>, by then it was just the working women in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, we too, stayed in the <span class="building">barrack</span> and we stayed under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">I don't think we stayed there too long because shortly afterwards they rounded everybody up at sunset, you know, after they came back from the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and they started marching the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="161">All the <span class="building">barracks</span> were rounded up and there were a few children and the children were sort of hidden between women, large skirts covered the children, and I guess they didn't look too closely at the legs to notice that sometimes --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Were you under the skirts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Well sort of. </sentence><sentence id="193">The skirts were sort of wrapped slightly around us, and they marched us to the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span> and they shoved us onto <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Can we go back for a moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Were you wounded? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="201">I had a wound -- at that particular time I had one wound in the back, one bullet wound in the back. </sentence><sentence id="202">Later on I got other wounds. </sentence><sentence id="203">I have about one, two -- I have seven wounds, seven bullet wounds. </sentence><sentence id="204">That was only one in the back that sort of grazed my back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Sideways? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Must have been sideways, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: When you walked into the situation and you saw the <span class="spatial object">guns</span>, was there any time for something to go through your head or --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: There was no time. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was no time and there were people sort of falling all over you. </sentence><sentence id="218">People were yelling and trying to run and you know how it is when people try to run and they don't know in which direction because no matter where they looked they were either standing with rifles or there were machine guns set up, so there was no place to run really. </sentence><sentence id="219">No, I don't remember realizing what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="220">All I knew was that I was tumbling into the <span class="dlf">pit</span> with everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="221">I didn't really realize what else I could do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: When you touched this blood --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: I didn't know if it was mine or if it was somebody elses. </sentence><sentence id="231">When you are hit by a bullet it doesn't hurt right away, but when it gets cold it gets stiff and it hurts, so my back was bothering me and obviously when they were trying to take my shirt off when I got back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, it was sticking to my back. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, I must have had some kind of a bullet wound in the back because I remember it stinging by then I had learned not to yell or cry about anything. </sentence><sentence id="233">You learn very fast that there's no point in complaining, really. </sentence><sentence id="234">So, I think I had one of the wounds there, it happened to me in the <span class="interior space">back</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Did you explain when the women asked you, did you explain what you saw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="243">I don't think anybody believed me about the dog. </sentence><sentence id="244">I don't think they believed me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">They looked at me in such a peculiar way and one of the women said well I know they have a dog, and I know they walk around with that dog, so there was a dog and I could not have invented him because I don't think I was familiar with German shepherds and I described the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="246">Except I described him but he had green eyes. </sentence><sentence id="247">How can he have green eyes? </sentence><sentence id="248">I saw green eyes. </sentence><sentence id="249">I don't think a dog has green eyes, really, but I described you know adequately so they that they thought maybe I did see a dog but they couldn't believe that the dog walked right past me and didn't start barking or tearing me a apart. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="250">That was the point, because I think that's what they were trained for. </sentence><sentence id="251">That was sort of a bizarre episode, that I just stopped talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="252">I decided I'm not going to -- but it stuck with me really, it really did stick with me that bizarre episode with the dog. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Were you very hungry in this place? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: I very often was very hungry, but what I remember most is thirst, always being thirsty and never having enough to drink. </sentence><sentence id="255">I think at one point I sort of lost my appetite for food except when you know you have a grumbling stomach, but I didn't know really. </sentence><sentence id="256">I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="257">I was always full of fear and hunger doesn't always assert itself when you're full of fear. </sentence><sentence id="258">Yes, I remember times that I was hungry, but not so much hungry as full of fear and very thirsty always. </sentence><sentence id="259">There was never enough to drink. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Did the women -- I don't know if you remember, did they share their food with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: You mean after this? </sentence><sentence id="269">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="270">They did. </sentence><sentence id="271">They would always bring back a piece of bread or something. </sentence><sentence id="272">They couldn't bring back soup or something because they would have seen them, but they always managed to put a piece of bread in their pocket to bring back a piece of bread for us or something that could be carried unobtrusively. </sentence><sentence id="273">You know, they couldn't opening carry something because it would have given it away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: When were you fed, at night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Was there some soup? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: There was some soup or potatoes or something like that or cabbage. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was very often cabbage and potatoes cooked together in sort of a soupy stuff which they handed out and a piece of bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Did the women there also give you some of what they were given? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Oh, you mean when we were still in the open? </sentence><sentence id="293">When we were still in the open they gave us some too. </sentence><sentence id="294">After that supposedly there weren't supposed to be any children or any idle mouths to feed so from then on, no. </sentence><sentence id="295">But before that carnage, I don't know how else to call it, they did give us some food too, maybe not as much as the women, but we didn't need as much really. </sentence><sentence id="296">Mostly what I remember is cabbage and potatoes, you know, cooked with some water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: But in spite of your fear, you were thinking very clearly where to go and what do to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Oh, yes, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="305">I had to get out of that <span class="dlf">pit</span>, that I knew. </sentence><sentence id="306">I had to wait until it was dark because I didn't feel too comfortable being out in the daylight uncovered. </sentence><sentence id="307">By then I had already learned that I couldn't be anywhere where I was seen. </sentence><sentence id="308">I did have the instinct to go back to the <span class="building">barrack</span> where I had been with my stepmother. </sentence><sentence id="309">That I did. </sentence><sentence id="310">I always had sort of a very good sense of direction, even in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, how to navigate my way and I learned very quickly how to navigate my way through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: Was your stepmother there in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: She had gone out and your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: My aunt was killed with the two girls on that afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="317">She and my two cousins were killed on that afternoon, and I survived. </sentence><sentence id="318">Don't ask my why. </sentence><sentence id="319">It's a lottery definitely, yes, it really is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Okay, so now they take you out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: We went sort of shoved into a <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> and what I remember -- that's a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="327">I really want to forget that because it was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="328">I don't know how many <span class="spatial object">cars</span> they had and how many people. </sentence><sentence id="329">I don't even know where they got all those people. </sentence><sentence id="330">I didn't think there was that many people. </sentence><sentence id="331">It was very crowded and they really shoved us in. </sentence><sentence id="332">It was very hot and it stank and it was night, you know, and I was absolutely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="333">I was petrified then. </sentence><sentence id="334">When the <span class="spatial object">car</span> stopped and they let us out, there were like search lights and again I could hear the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="335">I could hear German spoken and dogs barking, lots of dogs barking, and they kept on pushing us, quick, quick 5  appeared at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and told the women to walk out, and she took one of the little girls by the hand and said you come with me and he told the two of us, me and the other girl, you stay here, don't come with me. </sentence><sentence id="336">By then we didn't want to stay in the <span class="building">barrack</span>, we thought maybe he was trying to save her and leave us there. </sentence><sentence id="337">So, we kept on following him and he kept on saying go back, go back. </sentence><sentence id="338">He was getting angry with us so we sort of crept after him along the <span class="building">barrack</span> and he walked out with that little girl to that <span class="dlf">path</span> that was between the <span class="building">barrack</span> and the <span class="building">shed</span> and there was a <span class="spatial object">cot</span> and a body was lying on that <span class="spatial object">cot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was the other little girl's mother and he took out a gun and he shot the mother and he shot the little girl. </sentence><sentence id="340">So, the two of us really very quickly ran back to the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">We realized -- we didn't know what had happened, but that night when the women came back, one of the women was the sister of the woman who had been killed with her little girl and she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="342">She had red eyes, and when she walked out the others were saying that her sister had small pox or something and they didn't want the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> or something contagious. </sentence><sentence id="343">I think it was small pox, because I remember noticing that the little girl had some pimples, so I figured it must be something like that, so they killed both of them to make sure that the rest of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> didn't get infected. </sentence><sentence id="344">Why I don't know, you wonder why. </sentence><sentence id="345">But, from then on, it became even more threatening to be there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="346">We had sort of gotten used to a little bit to the routine but it became very threatening. </sentence><sentence id="347">And I was sort of turning more and more inward and to myself. </sentence><sentence id="348">I spoke very little. </sentence><sentence id="349">I never complained. </sentence><sentence id="350">From then on I was just sort of living full of fear. </sentence><sentence id="351">I remember waking up a couple of nights and seeing there was a candle and they had put a blanket over the <span class="dlf">door</span> so that it wouldn't show through and they were digging the <span class="dlf">hole</span>, the women under one of the <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">And my step mother walked over very angrily told me turn to the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and don't look. </sentence><sentence id="353">You haven't seen anything. </sentence><sentence id="354">That's all she had to say to me, believe me, I didn't see a thing. </sentence><sentence id="355">What I realized later on was they were digging a <span class="dlf">hole</span> to go out from under the <span class="building">barrack</span> and since we were surrounded by <span class="dlf">fields</span> there too, came a night when they woke us up, the two little girls, and the two mothers, my step mother and she and we all made our way under the <span class="dlf">holes</span> and we were out in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and we started running and we walked all night long. </sentence><sentence id="356">So, from then on, the routine was, we walked at night and we slept during the day in the <span class="region">wooded area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">Food was not often. </sentence><sentence id="358">Sometimes we would pick up apples so it must have been June, the late summer, it must have been the late summer because I remember also a lot of stubble on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> where we walked which meant they must have cut the crops already. </sentence><sentence id="359">Sometimes we would steal something if something was to be stolen and once I remember a peasant, a woman caught us while we were sleeping and the two women started talking to her and asking her for food and they offered her a ring. </sentence><sentence id="360">One of the women had a ring and they offered her a ring and then she didn't come back and we were sure she was going to go and get the Germans or somebody and we were ready to leave and then she came back with some bread and cold boiled potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="361">They never tasted so good, so we did get some food. </sentence><sentence id="362">This whole trek was taking place because my step mother had a brother who was in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and she was obviously trying to join him so I don't remember chronologically how long that journey took, but eventually we did meet up with that group in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, which was a very motley group. </sentence><sentence id="363">What I remember best was that her brother was very angry that she had a child in tow and it didn't pay to have children around and he tried various  0 means to detach me of the group and dispose of me, but by then I had become very watchful and very clever about avoiding him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: You mean literally trying to kill you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Oh, yes, oh he would have definitely disposed of me. </sentence><sentence id="405">I knew it. </sentence><sentence id="406">I knew it, so I tried never to be left alone with him anywhere and with a group I knew I was a little safer because he couldn't very well start shooting into the group. </sentence><sentence id="407">That became my life for a while living in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> it was full of escaped Jews from various <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">Incidently later I thought that this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> before they installed the <span class="building">crematorium</span> because the spot was right. </sentence><sentence id="409">Reading in books and I didn't know it until there was a gathering of Holocaust survivors here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, quite a few years ago, ten years ago, longer than that and there was all kinds of books which Jim picked up, my husband, and reading up on it sure enough <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> was to begin with a <span class="populated place">women's work camp</span>, and then they installed the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, so we must have left the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, escaped it just before it became really locked up and they started disposing of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="410">So, we must have just come out, because the <span class="region">area</span> was right, and it was a fairly large <span class="populated place">women's camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="411">I remember that the gatherings of women there. </sentence><sentence id="412">It was a large <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so it must have been <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">It wasn't just another <span class="populated place">camp</span> like the first one we were at. </sentence><sentence id="414">So, there we were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and during the summer it was perfectly okay, and there was quite a motley crew in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="415"> They were escaped people from the Russian Army deserters, there were Poles in it, women, children, lots of young women all of them carrying around guns, and armed, which was very strange. </sentence><sentence id="416">I don't know where they got their guns really and several children. </sentence><sentence id="417">We lived in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and at night they went to raid the <span class="dlf">farms</span> and they brought food back, so we did have some food in those places really. </sentence><sentence id="418">Never enough, never enough food and water was always a problem because the Germans were very often hunting us and if they had any suspicion if there was a group in the <span class="region">area</span> they would poison the <span class="env feature">waters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">So, it was very-- we were told not to drink anyway. </sentence><sentence id="420">You had to be very cautious where you got your <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">The winter was very rough and they just kept on hunting the groups. </sentence><sentence id="422">You know you never knew when you were going to be denounced by some people in the <span class="region">area</span> who had been robbed of food or such, and then set upon by the Germans, or the Poles more like it. </sentence><sentence id="423">There were more Poles than Germans at this point who were doing the hunting. </sentence><sentence id="424">They were the Poles who were in uniforms, in those black uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="425">On one of those hunts they kept on driving us like you would hear shots. </sentence><sentence id="426">You would run in a certain <span class="region">area</span> and they drove us out in a <span class="dlf">clearing</span> and when we got out ina <span class="dlf">clearing</span> we realized that they had machine guns set up on three sides of the <span class="dlf">clearing</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="427">Then they just opened fire and everybody war running back and forth and back and forth and on that particular hunt my step mother was hit and died. </sentence><sentence id="428">I saw her die. </sentence><sentence id="429">I literally saw her die. </sentence><sentence id="430">For some reason | escaped again. </sentence><sentence id="431">There weren't too many left of us. </sentence><sentence id="432">Again, we retreated towards the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and we stayed put until it was dark, completely dark. </sentence><sentence id="433">Usually their favorite time of hunting was towards the end of the day. </sentence><sentence id="434">Then we sort of congregated together. </sentence><sentence id="435">We couldn't drink because they poisoned the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">That's when I was really wounded because I had several bullet wounds from that and so did the other little girl. </sentence><sentence id="437">The other little girl was with us still. </sentence><sentence id="438">I don't remember any other children left  1 except her and me. </sentence><sentence id="439">Then they decided, the people who were left, that they had to -- we couldn't stay in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> the way we were. </sentence><sentence id="440">We were going to die, so they took both children to different <span class="populated place">villages</span> and all I remember is that they brought out a peasant, mine was Polish speaking, I don't know what the other one was because I don't know where they took her because some of the <span class="populated place">villages</span> were Ukrainian speaking <span class="populated place">villages</span> and some of them were Polish speaking <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="441">They told him that he had to take me in and take care of me and if anything happened to me they would lock him and his family in <span class="building">house</span> and burn the whole <span class="building">house</span> down. </sentence><sentence id="442">And they did that. </sentence><sentence id="443">They used to do that, so he knew they weren't bluffing. </sentence><sentence id="444">So, he carried me <span class="building">home</span> and they put me on top of the <span class="spatial object">bread oven</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="445">They would have a <span class="spatial object">bread oven</span> and then around the <span class="dlf">corner</span> on top there was a little <span class="dlf">knish</span> like and you could climb into the knish and it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="446">And I must have been very sick because I remember very little. </sentence><sentence id="447">I remember waking up and them feeding me some <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="448"> I must have run a very high fever and then they told me at night they would put me there and then they said they couldn't keep me there during the day because they had two boys or three boys even and the neighbors would sometime come in, although not often. </sentence><sentence id="449">There was very little traffic between the <span class="building">houses</span> and their <span class="building">house</span> was sort of at the edge of the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="450">I guess that's one of the reasons they picked that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="451">So, they told me he was going to dig a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="interior space">storage room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">He was going to lift a couple of planks and dig a <span class="dlf">hole</span> and I would have to be there during the day and then at night they would come and get me and put me on top of that <span class="spatial object">oven</span> to warm me up again. </sentence><sentence id="453">That whole winter I remember that constant going back and forth between that little <span class="dlf">hole</span> where I was just sort of reclining. </sentence><sentence id="454">It was just barely big enough to recline in and at night being taken out. </sentence><sentence id="455">I was completely stiff, and put on top of that <span class="spatial object">oven</span> to thaw out. </sentence><sentence id="456">It was pretty cold that place. </sentence><sentence id="457">I couldn't make any noise either. </sentence><sentence id="458">I wasn't supposed to make noise because if anybody came around the <span class="building">house</span> they might hear if any noises were coming out of there, so I kept very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="459">I was sick a lot of the time. </sentence><sentence id="460">I probably was delirious. </sentence><sentence id="461">I don't know, but quiet, in a quiet way. </sentence><sentence id="462">Then, the spring came and the peasants said to me you know during the spring the neighbors come and go and everybody is out in the <span class="dlf">field</span> and if they know you are here they could easily tell that to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="463">So, they talked it over it with me. </sentence><sentence id="464">They were good people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="465">They really were good people because they really sort of nursed me and they said what I should do is he was going to bring me part way to the next <span class="populated place">village</span> and then I should walk to the next <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="466">They were going to provide me with some shoes and clothes. </sentence><sentence id="467">I didn't have any shoes or clothes by then. </sentence><sentence id="468">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="469">I suppose they must have cut off my shoe because I had -- and I was going to have some shoes from the boys and they would give me some clothes. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="470">His wife was making me some clothes, and I was going to tell them that I came from that <span class="populated place">village</span>, from the <span class="populated place">Polish village</span> and I needed to hire myself out because my family was too poor and could they take me in as a cow hand. </sentence><sentence id="471">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="472">I walked to the next <span class="populated place">village</span>, and they hired me as a cow hand. </sentence><sentence id="473">So, from then, what I remember is spending a lot of time in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> with the herd, driving the herd in the morning and staying in the <span class="dlf">field</span> and I was told very precisely which <span class="dlf">fields</span> they were to graze when because they didn't want them to just ruin the <span class="dlf">field</span> so you had to drive your cattle to one <span class="dlf">field</span>, let it graze a certain amount of time and when the sun was at a certain point you drove your cattle to another <span class="dlf">field</span> and come back at night and they attempted to teach me  2 how to milk the cows which I wasn't too successful at the beginning, but I learned eventually, and assorted chores around the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, which I did and I stayed on that <span class="dlf">farm</span> in that <span class="populated place">Ukrainian speaking village</span> until the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="474">I remember the Russians coming and being in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">Actually the <span class="populated place">villages</span> were just as happy to get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="476">By then the Germans never put food there because they were somewhere else already so you hardly ever saw any Germans. </sentence><sentence id="477">Nobody was doing any hunting there. </sentence><sentence id="478">They were such remote <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">There was no electricity, no <span class="dlf">sewers</span>, no water, nothing like that there, so they didn't bother. </sentence><sentence id="480">The safety lay in that they were so remote, those <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="481">I remember the Russians coming through, the Russians soldiers being stationed right outside the <span class="populated place">village</span> and some of the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="482">I remember the guns going and I was told that that's when they had the siege of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">You could here the <span class="spatial object">guns</span>, all through the <span class="country">country</span> almost. </sentence><sentence id="484">They were those big that the Russians drove in. </sentence><sentence id="485">When they  3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="488">Q: But there were other children in the group also. </sentence><sentence id="489">Do you think he didn't want any children there at all or was there something about your presence with his sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: I think it was my presence because I was a burden to him and his sister. </sentence><sentence id="493">You know, ina group like that you never knew how long you were going to stay with a group and those groups were forming and reforming all the time. </sentence><sentence id="494">You might leave one group. </sentence><sentence id="495">There were many of those groups roaming around the <span class="region">countryside</span> and the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and he didn't know how long he was going to stay with the group and he obviously was going to take his sister and why did he need a child at that point. </sentence><sentence id="496">I remember them as being very young, both of them. </sentence><sentence id="497">So, I don't bear grudges. </sentence><sentence id="498">I understand it. </sentence><sentence id="499">A child was a burden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="508">Q: Was this a resistance group as far as you could tell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="510"> A Yes, indeed, some of them were resistance because I remember they would go off on missions at night to <span class="dlf">mines</span> somewhere and to blow up certain point so they were a resistance, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="511">They were part of the resistance group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q: Did you have any particular job in this group, any kind of responsibility as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="516">A: I don't think I had a responsibility, but I seemed to acquired a peculiar what do you call it, a peculiar calling. </sentence><sentence id="517">I seem to have an extra sense of when we were going to have the Germans descend on us in a hunt and I seemed to dream about my mother the night before. </sentence><sentence id="518">I have talked about it to some people. </sentence><sentence id="519">It's a ridiculous thing to say that I had a premonition or something but some people interpret it as I probably I had extra good hearing and I could hear maybe hooves of horses or <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> rolling somewhere and I could feel it because we all slept on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> obviously. </sentence><sentence id="520">That probably would trigger a dream where I was in danger and I would always wake up yelling and if I woke up yelling, everybody packed <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="521">So, I sort of became the mascot in a way. </sentence><sentence id="522">You know people who are in danger, whose lives are in danger are extremely superstitious and anything that helps them stay alive they will clutch at. </sentence><sentence id="523">That wasn't as far fetched as other things when you're trying to stay alive and you really don't know where your next salvation will come with. </sentence><sentence id="524"> 4 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Esthy, you were explaining about this dream and your prophetic --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: Powers. </sentence><sentence id="537">I don't really remember it that accurately, but I think the first time when I woke up, the dream, when I woke up I was yelling because I was frightened and I think the dream was, my mother, whom I knew was dead was chasing me and I didn't want her to catch me, and I was running. </sentence><sentence id="538">You know how you run in your dream and you're sort of slowed down, and then I realized that I had a scarf, so I took the scarf and I let it float behind me like a sail and I was sort of jumping from stone to stone and floating away while my mother was trying to catch me. </sentence><sentence id="539">I was running faster and faster and I felt myself falling, and that's when I would wake up yelling. </sentence><sentence id="540">That happened to me the first time in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> as far as I can recall. </sentence><sentence id="541">Of course someone was near me trying to put a hand on my <span class="spatial object">mount</span> to prevent me from yelling, and then everything around the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was talked about and known. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="548">Q: Wait one second. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: So, they must have discussed it and they asked me what my dream was. </sentence><sentence id="551">Somebody came up to ask me. </sentence><sentence id="552">There was always a leader in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you know, somebody was always a person whom they looked up to this was a man and he came to ask me what I had dreamt and I told him and he sort of listened and didn't say anything and then the next time it happened the woman woke me up, but this time she wasn't trying to stifle my yells. </sentence><sentence id="553">She just woke me up and I stopped screaming and she went and got the man and he came back and he asked me, and I told him it was the same dream. </sentence><sentence id="554">So, he left, and very shortly after the order was given to break <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">Usually an order would come and everyone would start packing up their immediate belongings and we started moving. </sentence><sentence id="556">And from then on, ovariotomy I had the dream, we packed <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we moved, so I figured it must have something to do with my dream. </sentence><sentence id="557">Somebody once asked me whether I wasn't tempted to just sort of give false signals. </sentence><sentence id="558">And I said absolutely not, believe me. </sentence><sentence id="559">I wasn't about to test anybody to give false signals because it could have been disastrous and then where would I have been. </sentence><sentence id="560">I had to depend on the good will of others to survive and this was no way of doing it, so you didn't give false signals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Did this give you a different place in the group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="575">I felt safer. </sentence><sentence id="576">I felt much safer. </sentence><sentence id="577">I felt for instance very often at night we went on long marches when we were changing <span class="populated place">camps</span> and from then on there was always somebody if I was lagging too far behind, somebody would pick me up for a while, sort of carry me around for awhile, carry me on, and then let me down. </sentence><sentence id="578">Very often before I was afraid I was going to be left behind and from then on I sort of sensed that I wasn't going to be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="579">I was going to be carried along if I faltered and if I stayed too far behind, which happened some times. </sentence><sentence id="580">It wasn't intentional, but I was sometimes so exhausted and my feet hurt that I just couldn't walk anymore and I would fall behind, so it was sort of a  5 helping hand that would come along and sometimes even two people would relay themselves and carry me for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="581">So, my status definitely did change from then on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: What you didn't describe was how they connected your dream with a raid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Well, the next day there was a raid. </sentence><sentence id="593">There was a raid after the first dream, and so the next time they obviously talked to each other and they decided to pack up <span class="populated place">camp</span> and sure enough there had been a raid on that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, because they sent back somebody and they found that the <span class="env feature">water</span> had been poisoned. </sentence><sentence id="594">They got to test the <span class="env feature">water</span> from time to time on a dog or an animal they would test it. </sentence><sentence id="595">There was no other way of testing the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="596">They decided there must have been a raid too because the <span class="env feature">water</span> was poisoned. </sentence><sentence id="597">So, from then on I became the <span class="spatial object">lightening rod</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">Is that the word for it? </sentence><sentence id="599">If I had the dream they would pack up <span class="populated place">camp</span> and go. </sentence><sentence id="600">As I mentioned that before when I checked with somebody the explanation that makes the most sense to me is that I must have had very good hearing, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="601">I had excellent hearing and eyesight too, that I must have heard some vibrations on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="602">Horses hooves or <span class="spatial object">carriages</span> being rolled along and that might have set me off that there was danger coming. </sentence><sentence id="603">When you live with danger, even when you're very young, you often develop an extra sense about when danger is coming and where it's coming from. </sentence><sentence id="604">You really do, so that must have been my sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: What about clothes in this group. </sentence><sentence id="619">What were you wearing? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="699">As a matter of fact, I think they probably must have just put some rags on my legs and my other ones so there wouldn't be a trail of blood when they carried me to the edge of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and they had the farmer pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="700">They must have bandaged it up with rags because it would have been too dangerous to have a trail of blood I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="701">When you get hit with bullets, you don't feel, unless it hits a bone or something like that, it takes a while for the wound to stiffen up and hurt really. </sentence><sentence id="702">At the beginning it doesn't hurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: Did people talk about the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: Hardly ever. </sentence><sentence id="849">Mostly they talked about the daily work and what they were doing, and then while I was there on that <span class="dlf">farm</span> he got married and that was an enormous event because at Polish wedding, literally it is a Polish wedding. </sentence><sentence id="850">It takes place a whole week of festivities when there's a Polish wedding. </sentence><sentence id="851">That was a lot of fun because everybody gets into the act. </sentence><sentence id="852">So, I was -- but he beat his wife too. </sentence><sentence id="853">It didn't take too long before he beat his wife. </sentence><sentence id="854">So, that was sort of interesting and that was a big event and ovariotomy a wedding takes places it's a big event in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="945">Then I got to know the boys who were very rowdy and I was sort of very sedate. </sentence><sentence id="946">And the mother used to always protect me. </sentence><sentence id="947">If they chased me too much I would always go and hide behind her and she would make a game of that. </sentence><sentence id="948">She like that. </sentence><sentence id="949">She liked having a girl. </sentence><sentence id="950">And I thought that was going to be my life and it wasn't so bad, really. </sentence><sentence id="951">So, I was there, and one day I came in and there was a couple, a man and a woman and the peasant said to me that they were people who had come they wanted to take me away and I said why. </sentence><sentence id="952">So, they started explaining to me that they were Jewish people and they thought that they wanted to pick up all the Jewish children who were hidden in the <span class="region">countryside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="953">They I remember they mentioned money that they would give some money and the peasant got angry and he said we don't want money. </sentence><sentence id="954">We want to keep her. </sentence><sentence id="955">By then I had been baptized and I had been given a little bit of catechism whatever you could get orally because I couldn't read or write, nor could they for that matter, probably. </sentence><sentence id="956">Everybody got it the same way. </sentence><sentence id="957">I was going to <span class="building">church</span> with them on Sundays, and I did not want to go back to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="958">I felt I really was catholic and for some reason I felt like the Jews were really the ones who killed Christ, so I wasn't going to get mixed up with the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

anything. </sentence><sentence id="978">So, I don't remember how it ended but they left those people and the next thing I know we were working in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">By then you know the spring was really advancing and we were working in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and I liked to feed the chickens so I was always sent back to the <span class="building">house</span> and I would feed the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="980">I started feeding the chickens an I hear a <span class="spatial object">car</span> drove up and here that man and that woman and she jumps down and she grabs me and she pushes me into the <span class="spatial object">cart</span> and off they ride with me. </sentence><sentence id="981">I look back and the last picture I see is the peasants running after them shaking their fists and they drove off with me. </sentence><sentence id="982">So, I was pretty miserable. </sentence><sentence

taking such good care of that girl and I kept on thinking wistfully God I wish I had someone to take care of me like that. </sentence><sentence id="989">I felt really disoriented in that period.

got there, you see. </sentence><sentence id="993">I have no recollection of how we got from  2 that place to <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="994">But in <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1242">A: It wasn't easy. </sentence><sentence id="1243">You know the best way of understanding another person is to put yourself in their shoes and I am very good at putting myself in the shoes of adults. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I couldn't put myself in the shoes of children. </sentence><sentence id="1245">As a consequence I was probably very over protective of my children. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I was always trying to keep them safe, which doesn't work. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I have come to certainly realize that. </sentence><sentence id="1248">You can't keep anybody safe, but part of the reason was that I didn't remember what it was as a child. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I couldn't venture out as a child because it was too dangerous, so consequently I probably tried to keep my children from straying somewhere where there might be danger. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And I know that I had peculiar fears like if they had a rash it used to drive me crazy until I realized that it had to do with that little girl that that was shot because she had pimples. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I associated pimples always with being sick and if you're sick you're going to get shot. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So, my kids never had a rash I can tell you that. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I drove them crazy but they didn't have a rash. </sentence><sentence id="1254">You know, it's things like that that I probably overdid as a mother. </sentence><sentence id="1255">But for a long time my children didn't know my past, which is again, I'm told, I didn't realize but I'm told that this is not usual with survivors of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I remember the first time my daughter came back from <span class="building">religious school</span> and they were talking about the Holocaust and she asked me point blank are you a Holocaust survivor, and I said yes, and she got very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1257">By then I think she must have been 10 or 11 years old which is an advanced age and she never had a glimmer that I might be a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1258">So, you know, it's --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q: Did you then tell her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Some, but then I wasn't able to talk about it all so I was very reticent and that probably created more anxiety than if I had told her. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Our son never questioned me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1280">He's the kind of a child probably that I was. </sentence><sentence id="1281">He absorbed things by observing. </sentence><sentence id="1282">He doesn't ask that many questions so he just absorbed and watched and didn't ask too many questions. </sentence><sentence id="1283">My daughter is a real questioner. </sentence><sentence id="1284">She likes to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Some of the answers I gave weren't entirely satisfactory. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Part of the reason was I wasn't able to talk about it then, yet. </sentence><sentence id="1287">It didn't come until much later when I was able to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I just sort of decided this was my past life, another life. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I was living in a different life and I was going to pretend I'm just as normal as everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1290">So, that's really the mission I took on. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I was going to lead a normal life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1306">Q: Did you imitate other mothers that you saw? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1320">Q: Maybe we should bring the pictures over here. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Why don't you explain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
