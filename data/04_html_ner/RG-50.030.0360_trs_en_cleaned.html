<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: We lived in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> in , <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, and it was a very close-knit family. </sentence><sentence id="23">My grandfather lived in a great big <span class="building">house</span>, and he had three children. </sentence><sentence id="24">My mother was the oldest of the three children, and when she was married he built an addition to his <span class="building">house</span> and we lived right behind his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">And my father came from ; <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and they were married. </sentence><sentence id="26">They had three children. </sentence><sentence id="27">My oldest sister was Josephine and I, Alice, and then my younger sister was Ellie. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father was very rich. </sentence><sentence id="29">My mother was not quite as rich as my father, but she followed his desires. </sentence><sentence id="30">And it was a very lovely, sheltered life that we led. </sentence><sentence id="31">We had a very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="32">My parents -- my mother was naturally totally devoted to her children and to her husband and to doing her housework. </sentence><sentence id="33">And my father was working in the <span class="building">building industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Actually, he probably started out as assistant in some kind of a <span class="region">locksmith area</span>, but developed into roofing and building materials. </sentence><sentence id="35">And he was -- we had a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, which was very unusual in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">It was a <span class="spatial object">convertible</span>, <span class="spatial object">scooter</span> (ph), and we were very protected. </sentence><sentence id="37">My -- we loved going in the summertime. </sentence><sentence id="38">We loved doing things like going into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and picking wild strawberries, wild flowers, and in the winter we were on our <span class="spatial object">skis</span> and our <span class="spatial object">skates</span> and sledding from morning to night. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother did all the sewing for us. </sentence><sentence id="40">We had beautiful homemade, handmade clothes, which my mother made. </sentence><sentence id="41">And -- which we didn't appreciate, by the way, too much because we did want to have store-bought things. </sentence><sentence id="42">But in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, I can't remember, but there was a <span class="building">shop</span> where they had ready-made things. </sentence><sentence id="43">My mother embroidered our underwear very carefully. </sentence><sentence id="44">Well, everything was handmade, hand knitted, and it was a very interesting, very different sort of existence. </sentence><sentence id="45">My father on Friday, my mother was -- had to get the <span class="building">house</span> ready for sabbath, and in the evening one the children, the three of us, went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> with my father. </sentence><sentence id="46">Then we came <span class="building">home</span> to a wonderful home-cooked meal, which was delicious. </sentence><sentence id="47">I always talked  about oh, the wonderful things my mother made because I tried to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="48">I learned, in fact, from memory to do almost all the things that my mother made. </sentence><sentence id="49">There were two or three things I couldn't remember how to do, but I -- in the tape that I did for children, I described in detail all the different menus that we had for our dinners. </sentence><sentence id="50">On Saturday, we were not allowed -- after sundown, we were not allowed to put the lights on in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">So everything was -- you know, had to, the sabbath had be observed very carefully. </sentence><sentence id="52">On Saturday morning we went to <span class="building">synagogue</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had to be dressed very carefully with special clothes for Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="54">We went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> with my father, and then after the <span class="building">synagogue</span> we came <span class="building">home</span> and ate whatever my mother had to prepare the day before. </sentence><sentence id="55">Because, as I said, we couldn't cook or put the lights on on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="56">And then after our meal, we went for a walk with our father. </sentence><sentence id="57">We went to visit the different families, Jewish families, in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">And we walked up and down the <span class="populated place">village</span>, visiting everybody and in the evening we came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">Oh, by the way, when -- the first <span class="building">house</span> in which we lived behind my grandfather's <span class="building">house</span>, we had no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="60">We lived in a very, very tiny little <span class="building">house</span>, actually. </sentence><sentence id="61">It had a one-room <span class="interior space">living room</span> and one <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>, and a very small <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">And we had a maid, and I'll tell you how our maid lived. </sentence><sentence id="63">She lived in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had a <span class="spatial object">kitchen table</span> which was like a <span class="spatial object">box</span>, and in the evening, the <span class="spatial object">kitchen table</span> -- the top was removed and the <span class="spatial object">box</span> was pulled apart and that was a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> in which our maid slept. </sentence><sentence id="65">And as my father worked himself up and became better well-to-do, better to do, he built a bigger <span class="building">house</span>, which was completed in 1938, I think. </sentence><sentence id="66">We just lived there about a year before we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="67">And, of course, that <span class="building">house</span> was large, consisted of three different <span class="spatial object">units</span> and then we had a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and electricity. </sentence><sentence id="68">But in the <span class="building">house</span> before that, we did not. </sentence><sentence id="69">The reason I mentioned that is because I said that Saturday after our walks when we walked with our father, when we came <span class="building">home</span> in the afternoon, we would sit in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> and tell stories and talk and really enjoy each other's company. </sentence><sentence id="70">And I love those evenings because it was getting dark, and I loved it when it was getting dark. </sentence><sentence id="71">And we couldn't put the light on until after the sabbath was over, and then the gas lamp was lit. </sentence><sentence id="72">But it was a very, very cozy lovely life as far as the children were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="73">Because my mother worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="74">She had to get up every morning at 6 o'clock in the morning to light the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> so that she could put on the <span class="spatial object">kettle</span> for the coffee and tea, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="75">We had a <span class="building">baker</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span>, and every morning they would deliver fresh rolls. </sentence><sentence id="76">Otherwise, my mother did all the -- everything that was done. </sentence><sentence id="77">Nothing was bought from a <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">That means noodles were made at <span class="building">home</span>, and bread was baked, actually, not at <span class="building">home</span>, but made and carried over to the baker to be baked. </sentence><sentence id="79">And then we had these huge loaves of bread that were brought <span class="building">home</span> and they lasted a week. </sentence><sentence id="80">And then my mother made the Friday or Saturday, and everything, in fact, she had to do herself. </sentence><sentence id="81">And we, as children, did not really participate too much in the household chores, but we played. </sentence><sentence id="82">You know, we played from morning to night. </sentence><sentence id="83">We had a great life. </sentence><sentence id="84">I loved it, I always adored the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I loved all the things that it gave us. </sentence><sentence id="86">I mean, I, as a child, I was aware of all beauties of the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">I loved the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and I loved the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I couldn't wait for the snow to melt for to be -- oh, I loved the feeling of the snow melting in the <span class="populated place">village</span> because then we could go into the  <span class="env feature">forest</span> and it was big snow drops, which I adored. </sentence><sentence id="89">Because the snow drops came out even while the snow was still on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Then we looked forward to the spring because we could pick, as I said earlier, wild flowers and wild strawberries, and then -- well, we had a cow. </sentence><sentence id="91">We had chickens. </sentence><sentence id="92">And I loved all these things, everything was so great, you know. </sentence><sentence id="93">My job was to catch the chickens to make -- to see whether they are going to have an egg to lay. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I did by inserting my little finger into the rear to see whether the egg was there, because I had to lock up the chickens if they were about to lay an egg so that they wouldn't lay them just anywhere, but in a <span class="spatial object">coop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">And so I -- and then we would ride with my father in his <span class="spatial object">car</span> to the other <span class="populated place">villages</span> because he went there on business, and it was a <span class="spatial object">convertible</span> and we would sit in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">And all the children would gather around us and try to toot the horn because they hadn't seen a <span class="spatial object">car</span> like that. </sentence><sentence id="97">And we would be so thrilled to be going out with him to do these things. </sentence><sentence id="98">Well, such a very lovely life, and we traveled in the summertime. </sentence><sentence id="99">We would travel to visit my uncle, my mother's younger brother, who lived in the <span class="populated place">Trnava</span> (ph), which was a <span class="building">spa</span> in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, a very well-known <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And he was director of the <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">He was actually the one who saved us in the end because he was -- shall I go back . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Well, tell us about your uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Because -- now, I'm just going to give you the life in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="185">So in summertime, we would visit our uncle in , and in the wintertime, of course, we couldn't wait for winter either because we had enormous amounts of snow. </sentence><sentence id="186">And the <span class="env feature">lakes</span> froze, our <span class="env feature">river</span> froze; we had very deep ice so we could immediately get on the <span class="spatial object">ice skates</span> and skate on the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">We would be up and down the <span class="env feature">hills</span> with our <span class="spatial object">sleds</span> from morning to night, and we would also sled across the <span class="env feature">lake</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">We adored it. </sentence><sentence id="189">And so every season had its special things for us, which we loved. </sentence><sentence id="190">We were very protected. </sentence><sentence id="191">We didn't really know about politics or what was going on, but our parents spoke several languages, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="192">My mother, because <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> once belongs to the Austria~-Hungarian Empire, when my mother went to <span class="building">school</span>, the language was Hungarian, okay? </sentence><sentence id="193">Also, Slovak, so she spoke fluent Hungarian, fluent Slovak, and she also spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="194">My -- the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span>, where I lived was quite intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="195">I mean, my uncle went to <span class="building">Prague University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">He was sent to -- he was very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="197">That was my mother's youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="198">My mother's sister, younger sister, was also educated and worked with my uncle in <span class="populated place">Trnava</span> (ph) in the <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">I'm not sure what kind of position she had, but she probably had some administrative position. </sentence><sentence id="200">She was always very elegant when she came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="201">She had always lovely dresses and her lovely silk stockings were very impressive. </sentence><sentence id="202">Of course, neither of them were married at that time. </sentence><sentence id="203">My mother was the one who was married and had the three children and worked very -- was a dressmaker and everything was just absolutely beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="204">My mother had excellent taste. </sentence><sentence id="205">We used to go with her to the <span class="building">store</span> where they sold fabrics, <span class="building">fabric store</span>, and she would pick things very carefully. </sentence><sentence id="206">And she would dress us very well. </sentence><sentence id="207">Everything was beautifully made, and we had also lovely ski outfits with beautifully knitted  sweaters and my mother, everything was so -- it seemed so beautiful to me when I look back at it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="208">I mean, nobody does things like we had at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">And we had my mother's linen was put away -- I mean the way they wash laundry, there was no hot water. </sentence><sentence id="210">I mean, I remember that they had to take the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> to the <span class="env feature">river</span> to rinse it. </sentence><sentence id="211">And the way we had to take a <span class="interior space">bath</span> when we were little, you know. </sentence><sentence id="212">I'll tell you about that. </sentence><sentence id="213">There was a <span class="interior space">bathtub</span> which was outside the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was made of metal and it was brought in on the Thursday, I think, every Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="215">So that we could all take a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And hot water had to be boiled and filled and then the three of us had a <span class="interior space">bath</span> in that thing. </sentence><sentence id="217">And then when we had our hair washed, we were very well protected because in those days there was no insulin and so lots of people lost children if they were not well looked after, because they had colds or all kinds of other illnesses. </sentence><sentence id="218">So my mother was very protective of us and when our hair was washed, she would put a scarf around it, we couldn't go out anywhere, you know. </sentence><sentence id="219">So, in any case, when I did this -- I did a tape for my children when I told this story about the <span class="interior space">bathtub</span>, my sister was very upset with me because she said I shouldn't be telling things like that. </sentence><sentence id="220">But I thought it was quiet interesting because it was all done very -- you know, it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="221">We enjoyed having our <span class="interior space">bath</span> inside the <span class="building">house</span>, and then my father got into that water. </sentence><sentence id="222">Of course, naturally, you couldn't boil enough water for everybody to have fresh <span class="interior space">bath</span>, so you all managed to get a <span class="interior space">bath</span> in that <span class="spatial object">tub</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was a very, very beautiful life. </sentence><sentence id="224">That's all I can say about it. </sentence><sentence id="225">We loved it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="269">Were you in <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="273">We were in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was a problem about the <span class="building">school</span>, though. </sentence><sentence id="275">I had a problem about it. </sentence><sentence id="276">We in the minority, of course. </sentence><sentence id="277">There was -- I think there was one, only one, maybe two Jewish children in the <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And talking about <span class="building">school</span> prayer, that really had an impact on me. </sentence><sentence id="279">| really minded very much not to have to -- you know, it was a Catholic country, <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="280">So the prayers were said every morning in <span class="building">class</span>, and I could not -- of course not, I could not participate in that, and I wouldn't, of course. </sentence><sentence id="281">My father -- well, I couldn't; I was Jewish, so I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="282">But I minded being different, I really -- I mean, if there's a discussion about prayer in <span class="building">school</span>, this really has said something to me because I definitely felt very left out. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I wanted to very much like everybody else, and since there were so few Jewish children, I felt that I was different from everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="284">The <span class="building">school</span>, I looked forward very much to going to <span class="building">school</span>, but once I started going, I soon realized that it was not so much fun after all, because we were really punished quite severely in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">We were punished by being beaten on our hands, you know, with a stick. </sentence><sentence id="286">Or we had to kneel in front of the <span class="building">class</span> if we did something that was unacceptable in some way or we talked, whatever we did. </sentence><sentence id="287">And I was punished quite often, and I had to kneel in front of the <span class="building">class</span> because I clowned around. </sentence><sentence id="288">And then I got punished some more, and I got hit on my hands quite often, but I did quite well. </sentence><sentence id="289">We had <span class="building">elementary school</span> and <span class="building">high school</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">The <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, which was like a <span class="building">junior college</span>, was in a <span class="populated place">town</span> which was two hours away from our <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">My parents decided that my older sister who was very much like my mother, she was very interested in being a  housewife -- when she was asked what she wants to be when she grows up, she wanted to be a mother. </sentence><sentence id="292">And so it was decided that she was going to go to a <span class="building">local high school</span>, and when I finished <span class="building">elementary school</span>, it was decided that I would be going to this <span class="building">junior college</span> two hours away from the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">So I traveled every single day by <span class="spatial object">train</span> two hours to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">I got up at 6 -- 5 o'clock in the morning or whatever; 5:30, 6:00. </sentence><sentence id="295">My father walked me through the <span class="env feature">snow</span> with a lantern to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was put on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, which was about two <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>, and we traveled to , which was a <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, which had a <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">And I went to <span class="building">Gymnasium</span> to the -- I didn't have to go to the first year because I took a test, I was very lucky always, which was maybe not luck, but I did a test and they decided that I should go to the second year, started the second year of <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">There were eight years of <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">I started in the second. </sentence><sentence id="300">Of course, I didn't last long because that was 1938, and 1939 I left. </sentence><sentence id="301">And I came <span class="building">home</span> every evening from -- every day from the <span class="building">school</span>, I think at about 3 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="302">I took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> at 3 o'clock, and I got back to the <span class="populated place">village</span> at 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="303">And I was walking back from the <span class="building">station</span>, I could -- my father was building this new <span class="building">house</span> into which we were going to move. </sentence><sentence id="304">And I would see him on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> of that <span class="building">house</span>; he was doing it himself. </sentence><sentence id="305">I mean, he had help, but he was working very hard to build that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">And we -- so schooling was good. </sentence><sentence id="307">I mean, you know, I did all right in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: At what point did the effect of the German effort start impacting your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: After the occupation in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, which was March 1939. </sentence><sentence id="563">We were occupied in March "39. </sentence><sentence id="564">At that point, just before the occupation, everybody was very patriotic, and they felt against -- of course, don't forget we were surrounded by lots of "enemies," in quotes, because at that -- well, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> was very patriotic. </sentence><sentence id="565">We were all big patriots, and we were very much against <span class="country">Germany</span>, against Austrian -- against <span class="country">Austria</span>, because it was an <span class="country">Austria-Hungary empire</span> at one time which was -- and then we were liberated in 1918, of course. </sentence><sentence id="566">Everybody was -- <span class="country">Austria</span> was not particularly -- it was an enemy. </sentence><sentence id="567">We were, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, surrounded by all these outside <span class="country">countries</span> which were once our occupiers, okay? </sentence><sentence id="568">So at first when there was a noise about being occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>, everybody was very patriotic, having a Czech flag in the lapel, and my friend, my best friend, , who was the daughter of this mayor, took this flag away from me and said, "You are not entitled to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="569">You are a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="570">And then afterwards, after we left, she felt very bad about it, because she went to see my mother -- I know that she went back from one of her letters, that she did go and see my mother after we left. </sentence><sentence id="571">So she obviously felt some  sorrow about it, so when <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> fell, that's when we, of course, immediately knew that this was a disaster of the greatest order. </sentence><sentence id="572">That morning I used to have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="573">That morning I woke up and it was daylight, and I was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="574">And I said, "How come I'm not up to take the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to the <span class="building">school</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="575">And I heard the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and the noise -- and the shrieking of Hitler, and my mother and father stood by the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> in terror. </sentence><sentence id="576">And they said, "You're not going to <span class="building">school</span> anymore," because they were too afraid to send me by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to 5 and so they would send , and so I stayed in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and I went to the <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="building">local school</span>, and I was not enrolled in that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">But I went as -- I just sat there on the <span class="building">classes</span>, and one day when I was sitting in the <span class="building">class</span> -- I was not participating, I was just listening to what was going on -- I looked out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> and I saw a couple of <span class="spatial object">buses</span> in the <span class="dlf">square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="578">And I looked and watched what was going on, and I saw some Jewish families being put on those <span class="spatial object">buses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was not my family, and not my grandparents, not my parents, but some poor families from out in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="580">And I was shocked, of course, and I didn't know what was happening, and I found out later they put them on the <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and drove them to the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span> because they were just going to drop them off. </sentence><sentence id="581">I mean, they were told to pack up and they were going to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="582">And they dropped them off on the <span class="dlf">Hungarian border</span>, and left them there. </sentence><sentence id="583">And, of course, it was a great shock to me, and I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="584">I was grateful it was none of my family, but, you know, I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="585">I mean, it was very shocking. </sentence><sentence id="586">It was the beginning when I realized things were -- I mean, it was so frightening that one didn't dare to think too much about it. </sentence><sentence id="587">I mean, at least I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="588">My parents did not discuss these things with us, which was too bad. </sentence><sentence id="589">But I guess they wanted to protect us. </sentence><sentence id="590">So the next thing that happened was that men were put on horses -- were asked to ride horses. </sentence><sentence id="591">The Jewish men were asked to -- these were not horses for riding. </sentence><sentence id="592">These were <span class="spatial object">cart horses</span>, you know, and they were to ride them to the next <span class="populated place">town</span>, which was sort of a torture thing. </sentence><sentence id="593">They got some men to do this, and, of course, it was terribly difficult for them to do that, and how can you ride these horses? </sentence><sentence id="594">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="595">It was a form of torturing these men. </sentence><sentence id="596">My father was also not -- I think he was not asked to do that. </sentence><sentence id="597">But some men were gathered to send to this <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the other things that happened had to do hard labor in the <span class="dlf">street</span> work. </sentence><sentence id="598">They gathered the Jewish men, and they had to that. </sentence><sentence id="599">And then my grandfather was very outspoken, and something happened there. </sentence><sentence id="600">He stood out on his <span class="dlf">front steps</span> and started screaming at somebody who painted something on his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="601">And it was all very scary; very, very frightening. </sentence><sentence id="602">So how did we know we were leaving?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: Well, who is giving these orders? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Who was giving -- well, there was still two priests that became head of the Fascist Party in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, okay? </sentence><sentence id="647">The one main priest was -- it was Hlinka, H-1-i-n-k-a, Hlinka was a priest and the Slovaks who joined his political party were called the Hlinka Guard, and they were men with arm bands, Slovaks. </sentence><sentence id="648">And the other priest was called Tiso, T-i-s-o, and he also became a Fascist and he was -- both these men wanted to separate from <span class="region">Bohemia</span>, which is the <span class="country">Czech Republic</span> now, and have an  0 independent <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">Well, Hitler allowed them to do that because Hitler -- then <span class="country">Slovakia</span> became, you know -- well, I'm not quite sure now, you see, how that worked. </sentence><sentence id="650"><span class="populated place">Bohemia</span>, which was the <span class="country">Czech Republic</span>, was occupied, but <span class="country">Slovakia</span> became sort of a protectorate of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="651">So it was participating in this with <span class="country">Germany</span>, it was not occupied as such. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: Did government troops come into your <span class="populated place">village</span>, or did the local people you had grown up with enforce this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: I think it's the local people that enforced it. </sentence><sentence id="661">I didn't see any government troops. </sentence><sentence id="662">I mean, as far as I know, there were no government troops, but the local people who joined the Hlinka Guard must have participated in this. </sentence><sentence id="663">I never saw a German soldier come into the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">But, of course, you know, we left in "39, so I don't know what happened afterwards, but as far as I know, it was local people. </sentence><sentence id="665">And there could have been some other officials of some, who were sent from other <span class="populated place">villages</span> or <span class="populated place">towns</span>, but I think it was the local people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: Were there restrictions placed on the Jewish family? </sentence><sentence id="673">Was property stolen? </sentence><sentence id="674">Did any of that sort of thing take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1445">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Uh-huh, we did. </sentence><sentence id="1447">That's one thing, when we went to visit my uncle for a holiday in my diary, which I decided to read recently, I have a notation that we went to see my uncle and it was during a Jewish holiday. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And we were so shocked to find that we went to a movie, and it was a Jewish holiday and we were really glad to get back to the <span class="building">home</span> because we were able to observe the second night of Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Because my uncle, we did nothing at my uncle's <span class="building">house</span>, and we were glad to get <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="populated

id="1451">Played tennis. </sentence><sentence id="1452">We learned to play tennis. </sentence><sentence id="1453">We went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1454">We  0 learned all kinds of things there, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Very good. </sentence><sentence id="1456">But, of course, it was still a very lonely place for many of us. </sentence><sentence id="1457">We shared -- we lived in a <span class="interior space">room</span>, I think there were nine of us in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1458">I have a drawing of the <span class="interior space">room</span> where we stayed because we didn't stay in the main <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1459">We -- as I said earlier, there was an addition built to the <span class="building">house</span>, a temporary addition, to house the children. </sentence><sentence id="1460">So we all lived in the back of the <span class="building">house</span>, which was a temporary thing, and we shared -- I mean, there were nine in our <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1461">There were nine children. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And we had all kinds of things that were being done for us, all kinds of tutoring. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And my older sister had to help in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And eventually, I -- there were big girls and little girls. </sentence><sentence id="1465">The little girls were like my little sister, and the big girls were like my older sister, 15 and 16. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And the big girls had to look after -- each big girl had a little girl to look after like combing hair and doing things for her. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And going to <span class="building">school</span>, where all the big girl had to take care of the little girl, going to <span class="building">school</span> and coming back from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So we were taken care of quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And my uncle, we were in touch with him a lot, and we had pocket money, six pence a week for which had to buy stamps. </sentence><sentence id="1470">We had mail from our parents because my parents found a way to communicate with us via <span class="country">Hungary</span>, before <span class="country">Hungary</span> -- because <span class="country">Hungary</span> was not in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And through the <span class="country">United States</span>, my father had a brother in <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>, <span class="country">America</span>, and a sister -- I think it was stepbrother and stepsister in <span class="region">Vermont</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And my mother got in touch with those families and wrote them and asked would -- if they would take us. </sentence><sentence id="1473">So my uncle in <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span> whom I've never met immediately started to proceed to try to get us over to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And I have letters and affidavits which they immediately started to do, but it was too late because, first of all, we didn't even want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1475">The three of us didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1476">We wanted to stay in <span class="country">England</span> because we didn't want to go that far away from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1477">But my other uncle would -- did everything he could to try to get us over, and he would send us letters and in the letter, he would sometimes send us a dollar or two dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And it was thrilling because we had so little money that we were always thrilled when we got a dollar, which was then five shillings, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1479">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1480">In any case, we didn't really want to go away from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1481">We wanted to stay together and go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1482">That was our thought, but we were so relieved when we didn't have to go to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1483">But my uncle wrote in this letter saying that they have enough resources to take care of all three of us. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Well, we stayed. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1525">Q: What were your parents saying in their letters? </sentence><sentence id="1526">It must have been great to get their mail. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1547">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1548">They wrote -- unfortunately, I wish they would have written exactly what was going on, but they wouldn't, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Why would they tell the children painful things? </sentence><sentence id="1550">But it must have been very, very difficult for them already in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And it must have been -- and they wrote a little bit about my grandfather who obviously was having a terrible time because he had to leave his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1552">His <span class="building">house</span> was taken over by somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And they put him into some kind of a <span class="interior space">room</span> somewhere where he had no <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Because my mother wrote saying that it must be very hard for her father to be living without a <span class="dlf">window</span>, so I don't know where they had put him. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And they wrote us things like sent us recipes because we said be sure to send us a recipe about this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And then we would write them to say what we were doing, what we're learning, and what we were sewing, and what we were crocheting, and what we were knitting. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And we would describe in great detail what we got for our birthdays and what -- we just gave them the most enthusiastic reports about our life in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And they were just thrilled about getting the letters, of course, and they would say how grateful they were that we were such good children and that we were telling them, that we were writing to them so regularly. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Because that's the only thing, of course, that they had that was joyful. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And they sent us -- I remember my mother sent us packages of knitted things, sweaters, and cookies probably. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Whatever she could do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1577">Q: Were you homesick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1579">A: Oh, terribly homesick. </sentence><sentence id="1580">Many of the children in the <span class="building">home</span> were very fortunate because they were just there temporarily until their parents got out. </sentence><sentence id="1581">Those were the worst times in our lives when other children's parents came to get them. </sentence><sentence id="1582">Because we felt terribly envious, I should say, but at the same time, we were too ashamed not to be happy for the child, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1583">Because you had to be happy for the child. </sentence><sentence id="1584">But, on the other hand, you knew that you never, your parents are never going to come out because the war had started and it was -- and it was just completely -- well, completely hopeless. </sentence><sentence id="1585">We could have done -- I always wonder whether we could have done something to get them out, but we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1586">Because, first of all, it was July and August, two months, and the war broke out in September. </sentence><sentence id="1587">So after that, it was over; you couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1588">So we only would have had two months to do something in. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Then my mother wrote to say that my grandmother came to stay with them from <span class="country">Poland</span>, and so that they couldn't leave anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And I feel my parents were -- my father was very enterprising. </sentence><sentence id="1591">My mother was a very bright, intelligent woman, and they would have certainly tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1592">My father always wanted to leave long before we left. </sentence><sentence id="1593">He wanted to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, but my mother wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1594">He wanted to, he would have gone long ago. </sentence><sentence id="1595">He was a great Zionist, he would definitely left long ago if my mother -- but my mother would not leave. </sentence><sentence id="1596">Because my mother's family has been in the <span class="populated place">village</span> for many generations, and my mother was very, very assimilated into the community. </sentence><sentence id="1597">So she would not, she didn't want to leave to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1598">But my father may have tried. </sentence><sentence id="1599">Well, he would have gone. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Where  2 would he have gone? </sentence><sentence id="1601">If he had escaped, he would have probably gone into <span class="country">Poland</span>, which was going to be the end, the worst end. </sentence><sentence id="1602">Or maybe they might have continued on to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, I don't know where they would have gone. </sentence><sentence id="1603">But my uncle -- I know that my husband's aunt, who came to <span class="country">England</span>, got everybody out from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Certain people, because she went around -- but she was much older. </sentence><sentence id="1605">She was in her 30s late, and she went around and she got signatures for all her family. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Now, we were too little to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1607">Now, if I reproach myself about anything at all, it is because I felt if we had been a little older we might have been able to get my parents out. </sentence><sentence id="1608">But who know? </sentence><sentence id="1609">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1610">In any case, so they wrote us these -- my mother wrote these long letters. </sentence><sentence id="1611">I said to her in my letter "We're off the <span class="dlf">road</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1612">And I have a couple of those letters because when I went back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and I was given that book, a book with some photographs, among those things were two of our letters, which I was just amazed how well we wrote. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And, well, when... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1651">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1652">I kept a diary while I was at this <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1655">Q: What kind... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1657">A: Which is very good. </sentence><sentence id="1658">I'm sorry now that I didn't keep it more carefully, but I kept it for about until about 1941, when I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1659">Because in 1941, we had to leave the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Suddenly -- you see, this <span class="region">area</span> was near the <span class="env feature">coast</span>, and besides the money -- whoever supported this <span class="building">home</span>, whichever organization supported which could have been American. </sentence><sentence id="1661">I think American and British, I don't know who did. </sentence><sentence id="1662">I don't know where the money came from actually. </sentence><sentence id="1663">That stopped and also that <span class="region">area</span> was restricted and everybody had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So we had to be -- this is where the problems started. </sentence><sentence id="1665">We had to be sent somewhere, and that became a great, big problem because where to send the children. </sentence><sentence id="1666">What to, you know -- oh, I have to go back to when I told you about parents coming to get the children, it was very, very painful. </sentence><sentence id="1667">The other thing which was extremely for me, but I'm a great -- I'm able to sort of push it aside and look at the more positive things and to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1668">I'm a survivor, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1669">When I went to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and I saw parents walking with their children hand in hand, that broke my heart. </sentence><sentence id="1670">I used to be terribly upset about that because I felt -- that's when I felt the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1671">You know, but, otherwise, you look forward in the letters. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I mean, that's about it, and the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1673">Then we had to worry about what to do because everybody had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And my little sister -- the older children had to leave first. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And that's it began to dawn on us. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Of course, there were air raids. </sentence><sentence id="1677">While we lived already in the <span class="building">home</span> still, air raids started. </sentence><sentence id="1678">But we were -- well, we had to be sort of split up because my older sister was sent to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and she went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1679">There was a young women's home run by a Jewish refugee woman. </sentence><sentence id="1680">She had an ordinary <span class="building">house</span> in which she had housed, maybe she had 10 or 12, 20 girls who lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1681">It was a <span class="building">house</span> that was a <span class="building">hostel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And she provided breakfast and dinner, and she also ran something called the <span class="building">British Restaurant</span>, where she cooked where you could buy  3 cheap meals. </sentence><sentence id="1683">But I think she just ran the <span class="building">hostel</span>; it was in <span class="populated place">Hampstead</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1684">So my sister was sent to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and she went to that <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And she -- but she had to be self-supporting, so she went to work in a <span class="building">dressmaker shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And she was -- then whatever she earned, she paid in that <span class="building">home</span> to live there. </sentence><sentence id="1687">My younger sister was sent to some families not far from the <span class="building">home</span> where we were at. </sentence><sentence id="1688">And she lived with some Quaker families, and she was very, very unhappy about having to be split up from us. </sentence><sentence id="1689">She was very heartbroken about that because she just didn't want to leave us, but there was no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1690">This is where my older sister blamed my uncle, that he should have taken her. </sentence><sentence id="1691">But by this time, my uncle has lost his -- there was no job because the representation from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> when the war broke out, that was over. </sentence><sentence id="1692">There was no more income, and he was not qualified to do -- he was an engineer, chemical engineer, but he had no job. </sentence><sentence id="1693">The war started, and he didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="1694">At that point, he couldn't have taken her. </sentence><sentence id="1695">Or maybe he could have, and they could have done the best they could with the little they had, but they just didn't take her. </sentence><sentence id="1696">And that, at this point, it is that my sister blames them because she felt they should have taken my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Now, my little sister, even though my older sister and my little sister had this guardian, Myra Hess (ph), who I think paid the money that was only a cash transaction, I think she guaranteed for 70 children, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1698">She didn't have anything personally, she drove a -- so my little sister had a hard time because I don't know what kind of family she stayed with, but she was moved around a great deal from family to family. </sentence><sentence id="1699">And she told me that on Friday afternoons in <span class="building">school</span>, they would say, "Who is going to take Ellie? </sentence><sentence id="1700">Who can take Ellie for maybe next week or next holiday?" </sentence><sentence id="1701">or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1702">And she just remembers that mainly that people would ask who will take her. </sentence><sentence id="1703">But then she had some positive things about staying with those families because she did have it regular. </sentence><sentence id="1704">She went to <span class="building">school</span> through the entire <span class="dlf">system</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1705">She matriculated and she did everything that any English child does. </sentence><sentence id="1706">She did have that privilege. </sentence><sentence id="1707">She went through the entire system of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Now, with me it was a different story. </sentence><sentence id="1709">When I came to <span class="populated place">London</span> and there was guardian, Fannie Bandit, who was just -- she was wonderful in one respect. </sentence><sentence id="1710">She just loved having this child, me. </sentence><sentence id="1711">But she didn't want me to live with -- I mean, there was no question of my living with her. </sentence><sentence id="1712">Although she lived in a very elegant <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on <span class="dlf">Penchley (ph) Road</span>, and she had a housekeeper and I used to go to -- I was invited for lunches and whatever, and it was splendidly elegant. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I can't tell you how beautiful and elegant it was because she was a grand lady. </sentence><sentence id="1714">And she -- I mean, when I was invited for lunch, everything was set up just as if it was an important visitor had come, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1715">I mean, the crystal and the silver and the dishes, and we would go to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> and then the housekeeper would come and serve the meal from the left. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And we had to help our -- I mean, I learned all my good manners at my guardian's and she had this beautiful <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> with a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> that flushed. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And she had all these lovely things and I just loved being with her, but there was no question of her taking me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1718">But when this <span class="building">home</span> broke up in <span class="country">England</span>, in <span class="populated place">Wyberley</span>, <span class="populated place">Burgess Hill</span>, my uncle went, this guardian with me and said, "Look, she can no longer stay in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1719">You could do something." </sentence><sentence id="1720">And I sat in the next <span class="interior space">room</span>, and they argued and she said, "But you promised me that you only needed a signature from me. </sentence><sentence id="1721">You told me  4 that I wouldn't have to do anything." </sentence><sentence id="1722">And he said, "Yes, but I didn't know there was going to be a war, and this thing fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="1723">The <span class="building">home</span> is no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Somebody's got to take care of her." </sentence><sentence id="1725">And she said, "But you promised." </sentence><sentence id="1726">And, you know, she just didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And so I sat there absolutely stricken with fear, and I hated that they argued about me like this. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And so I said to myself will they be able to come and ask me what I'm going to do, what I want to do. </sentence><sentence id="1729">And so I will have to tell them quickly, and what can I do that I could earn my living? </sentence><sentence id="1730">Because my sister was already earning her own living, and I didn't have any skills. </sentence><sentence id="1731">So I said to myself I will say that I can wash hair because that doesn't require any skills. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So when they came out and she said to me "Well, what do you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="1733">What do you want to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1734">And I said, "I can be a hairdresser; I can wash hair." </sentence><sentence id="1735">And she said no, or my uncle said no. </sentence><sentence id="1736">In any case, they came to some arrangement where he begged her to send me to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And she said, okay, she would do that. </sentence><sentence id="1738">She finally agreed to it after a long argument, and she said, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1739">they agreed that he would go to <span class="populated place">Bexley</span> (ph) College to talk to them to see whether they would take me. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Because | didn't speak English really. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And she said, "Okay, I will pay for the <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1742">And my uncle said, "She can stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="1743">I'll put her up until she learns to short and type." </sentence><sentence id="1744">And so my uncle whose wife had been evacuated with the baby to the <span class="country">country</span>, lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> by himself. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And he said he would be able to take me until I'm out of -- as long as I'm in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1746">So my guardian said, okay, she will pay for the <span class="building">school</span>, and as far as I remember, she said she would pay him maintenance for me. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And she would give me five shillings pocket money a week. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And so my uncle went to the headmaster of <span class="building">Bexley (ph) College</span>, and begged him to take me because the headmaster said, "I can't take her to , She doesn't speak English." </sentence><sentence id="1749">And he begged him, he said, "You must give her a try because this is her only chance, because this lady is willing to pay for her education." </sentence><sentence id="1750">So the headmaster said, "Okay, I'll try it." </sentence><sentence id="1751">And, of course, I felt absolutely obligated to try to get out of there as fast as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1752">It was a two- or three-year college. </sentence><sentence id="1753">I was out of there in 10 months, and I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="1754">And then I had to move from my uncle's to the same <span class="building">home</span> that my older sister lived in that <span class="building">girl's home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And I went -- the headmaster complained to my uncle that I was not socializing with other children. </sentence><sentence id="1756">When I -- during recess, I was always sitting at my <span class="spatial object">desk</span> working. </sentence><sentence id="1757">I had to because I could learn children only phonetically because I don't understand the words they were saying, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1758">But he kept me, and I graduated in 10 months with -- I would have preferred to stay there longer because my skills would have been better, but I was able to type and I was able to take shorthand, even though I didn't understand what I was taking. </sentence><sentence id="1759">And when I got my first job at the <span class="building">book shop</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, near <span class="populated place">St. Paul's</span>, I earned I think one pound five shillings a week and -- two pounds, five shillings. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And with that money, I immediately got into the <span class="building">hostel</span> where my sister was, and I paid all my money there, to live there. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And that was the extent of my education. </sentence><sentence id="1762">From there -- my guardian was always looked after me. </sentence><sentence id="1763">I mean, she was good to me. </sentence><sentence id="1764">She always invited me out. </sentence><sentence id="1765">Oh, when she finally argued and decided to send me to <span class="building">school</span> to show him that she is not ungenerous, she took me out and bought me a coat and a few things. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And she gave me this pocket money every week, and she would invite me very often. </sentence><sentence id="1767">I believe she loved me and I loved her, but that's  5 all she could do. </sentence><sentence id="1768">You know, she just didn't know how to do anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1769">And she would invite me to spend weekends with her sometimes, and she had a huge family in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And none of them every thought of including me in anything. </sentence><sentence id="1771">They had children my age or younger, but this was a Jewish family in <span class="populated place">London</span> and they did not want me in this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1889">A: Felt very -- I felt it was unkind. </sentence><sentence id="1890">Unkind. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I felt -- they had birthday parties going for little children, for children -- I was never included in anything. </sentence><sentence id="1892">They didn't -- but now when I go to <span class="populated place">London</span>, they try to make a big fuss of us. </sentence><sentence id="1893">But in those days, they didn't think of doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="1894">But it destroyed many Jewish families that they did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1901">Q: Could you accept your guardian's <span class="dlf">limits</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1903">A: Yes, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Because she was truly loving and she -- oh, one thing I must mention in this. </sentence><sentence id="1905">For as long as she lived afterwards whenever we saw each other, whenever she was in any company at all, she would tell the story that I wanted -- "she wanted to be a hairdresser, but I saved her from this." </sentence><sentence id="1906">Well, I let her go on telling that story until towards the very end of her life when I was with nieces and nephews, all those fancy nieces and nephews, I mean, hew nephew had invited me to dinner one day when I was older and attractive and he was a young officer in the British Army. </sentence><sentence id="1907">When he invited me to dinner, it would be at the <span class="building">Savoy Hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1908">You know, the fanciest place in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1909">In any case, I told him when I saw them the last time, I said, "Your aunt always told you that I wanted to be a hairdresser. </sentence><sentence id="1910">That was her story." </sentence><sentence id="1911">And I told him the story that it wasn't because I wanted to be a hairdresser, but because I didn't want her to feel that she should be having to pay for me, because I needed to earn my own living. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So that was the story about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1923">Q: They didn't teach you English at the first <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1925">A: Yes, they did, but it was not sufficient to be able to take -- I mean, it was basic English. </sentence><sentence id="1926">I mean, the first words in English that I learned, I needed to learn words that would take care of my sister, my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Because my little sister was not very well. </sentence><sentence id="1928">She was -- what do I say? </sentence><sentence id="1929">Not sickly, not really sickly, but she was the baby at <span class="building">home</span>, she was spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And she was frail, that's the word. </sentence><sentence id="1931"><span class="dlf">Frail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And I said I must learn to tell people that she is not well, but I didn't know how to say it. </sentence><sentence id="1933">So I would learn -- the first thing I learned was to say, "My sister has a headache." </sentence><sentence id="1934">Those were my first English words. " </sentence><sentence id="1935">My sister has a headache." </sentence><sentence id="1936">That's all I needed to know. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And when we were dispersed from this <span class="building">home</span>, I had saved 15 shillings. </sentence><sentence id="1938">Do you know how much that is? </sentence><sentence id="1939">15 shillings, it was about $3. </sentence><sentence id="1940">And when we were dispersed, I gave her my $3 because I said I will be able to take care of myself, but she needed -- I wanted to do everything. </sentence><sentence id="1941">You see, when she was born, I was very envious of the fact there was a baby in the family, and so I always had a sort of slight guilt feeling that I  6 wanted to get her out of her <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, because she displaced me from parents" <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> when I was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I used to sleep in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>, but when she was born, I had to get out because the <span class="spatial object">crib</span> had to come in there. </sentence><sentence id="1943">So I always resented that part, so I always felt that I had to make up for that. </sentence><sentence id="1944">Because I felt if something happened, that was my fault, because of my bad thoughts, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1945">So I would give up all the money, all the money I had so that she would -- because I needed to have the peace of mind that I've done everything for her. </sentence><sentence id="1946">So I learned to say, "My sister has a headache." </sentence><sentence id="1947">And I gave her all my pocket money, so that the result of my parents" teaching, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1948">Because my mother always wrote in every letter "The main thing is that you should get along with each other, and you've got to love each other and you have to get along with each other." </sentence><sentence id="1949">And so I -- and another thing, whenever I did anything at all, it was always a question in my mind was is that what they would want me to do? </sentence><sentence id="1950">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1951">So we all behaved better than we would have done had we lived with our parents, because we always lived by the standard that we want more than -- I mean, we were -- I, particularly, was totally exaggerated. </sentence><sentence id="1952">The only <span class="region">area</span> where I didn't follow is in the religion. </sentence><sentence id="1953">I did not follow my father's footsteps because I thought I was so -- and to me this whole disaster was incomprehensible, so I did not -- that's one justice -- I feel I'm perfectly justified not to have followed that. </sentence><sentence id="1954">So, otherwise, we did everything what my mother -- you know, I did everything for my sisters afterwards because I, no matter what they did -- I mean, they always were good. </sentence><sentence id="1955">We were always good. </sentence><sentence id="1956">But I took it upon myself to be the -- I mean, I just did not argue about anything with them. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I just gave in. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I mean, I won't say that I was absolutely like that when I was a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="1959">My older sister was the one who took care of us. </sentence><sentence id="1960">I did go through her <span class="interior space">drawers</span> and I borrowed her blouses, and I used -- and I made her do my mending for me and do all kinds of stuff, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1961">Oh, we had do our own mending and, you know, we had to darn our socks and darn our -- I mean, that's the kind of -- in the last year my mother taught us all these things, to do all these things before we left. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2480">In any case, at 10 o'clock, I said to my husband, "I've got to get out of this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2481">I've got to get out of here." </sentence><sentence id="2482">So we took a little walk. </sentence><sentence id="2483">We went to the <span class="env feature">woods</span> where I used to go. </sentence><sentence id="2484">That's when I saw that big <span class="dlf">grave</span> and the monument to the people, and then we got into the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2485">I said, "We've got to get out of here, and don't stop." </sentence><sentence id="2486">We got there at 6 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2487">At 10 o'clock in the morning, we were on our way out. </sentence><sentence id="2488">And we drove fast to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, as fast as we could. </sentence><sentence id="2489">And we almost got shot by the border guards because my husband didn't realize that somebody was trying to stop us, because somebody was flashing a lantern. </sentence><sentence id="2490">He thought it was a bicyclist, and it was the <span class="building">border guard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2491">But I was so ill in the back <span class="spatial object">seat</span>, I was sick all the way to <span class="populated

to dinner. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And I just slept and slept. </sentence><sentence id="2501">Woke up the next morning and just relaxed, and then I realized that this was the best thing that ever happened to me, that I went back. </sentence><sentence id="2502">I made my final journey <span class="building">home</span>, my return journey. </sentence><sentence id="2503">That's what I was waiting for all these years, to make the return journey. </sentence><sentence id="2504">Because I lived out of my <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, and I didn't realize that. </sentence><sentence id="2505">For all those years, even when I had -- until 1970, I lived into my <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2506">And then we -- I came <span class="building">home</span>, and it was the best thing that could have happened. </sentence><sentence id="2507">When I drove to work through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span>, I used to work -- before that, I used to drive to work through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span>, and I used to say to myself almost every day, "This is very pretty, but it is not <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2508">There are no snowdrops here and no wild flowers." </sentence><sentence id="2509">And I missed it so much. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And then I came back from that trip; I drove through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span> and I said, "Well, strawberries and snowdrops are not everything." </sentence><sentence id="2511">And I was just -- suddenly, I realized that this is what was bothering me. </sentence><sentence id="2512">I just had to make the trip back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And even though I stayed there from 6:00 in the evening until 10:00 in the morning, it did it for me. </sentence><sentence id="2514">And I said, "I don't want to sell the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Just take it, do whatever you like, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2516">I don't want to deal with the <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2517">Which I felt a little ashamed because my father put everything -- you know, he wanted us to have this, but I had to leave it behind. </sentence><sentence id="2518">I can't deal with it. </sentence><sentence id="2519">And that's when they told me about all the -- I mean, you know, nobody returned anything when my sister went back. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And when you think about what actually happened was that people were just greedy, and they wanted -- that was about the material things. </sentence><sentence id="2521">They wanted to take the things away from the people, from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2522">That gave them the license to take things away and to even kill, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2523">I mean, they put people in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and they didn't care what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="2524">But they were able to get into their <span class="building">houses</span> and take the <span class="dlf">property</span> away, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2525">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="2526">That's all.
