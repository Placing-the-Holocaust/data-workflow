<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Good afternoon, <span class="populated place">Flory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, <span class="country">Bosnia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">You want to know when? </sentence><sentence id="7">I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923. </sentence><sentence id="8">A lot of years. </sentence><sentence id="9">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older. </sentence><sentence id="10">But this is more or less around 70s and so. </sentence><sentence id="11">And they have one thing in common -- silence. </sentence><sentence id="12">They sort of don't like to talk. </sentence><sentence id="13">We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal. </sentence><sentence id="14">And you don't want to scratch it. </sentence><sentence id="15">It bleeds. </sentence><sentence id="16">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness. </sentence><sentence id="17">They want to forget. </sentence><sentence id="18">And it works for a while. </sentence><sentence id="19">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I was quite a busy lady. </sentence><sentence id="22">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older. </sentence><sentence id="23">And you know, you don't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="24">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless. </sentence><sentence id="25">And, uh, then you read these horrible stories -- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="26">Your whole inner starts screaming. </sentence><sentence id="27">I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="28">Age definitely had something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="29">So here Iam. </sentence><sentence id="30">I'm going to take you to a small little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, and share with you my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="31">Actually, I'm not going to start in <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">We will go about 98 kilometers up <span class="region">northeast</span> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection <span class="country">Bosnia</span>, a small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span>, very picturesque. </sentence><sentence id="35">It's know for its <span class="env feature">pine trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">My whole family lived there. </sentence><sentence id="37">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family. </sentence><sentence id="38">And they were very proud of their name. </sentence><sentence id="39">It meant , the high place -- very proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="40">And, you  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Now the life in <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span> -- it was a very simple life. </sentence><sentence id="41">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families. </sentence><sentence id="42">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="43">my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="44">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="45">She sang beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="46">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring <span class="populated place">villages</span>, she knew herbs. </sentence><sentence id="47">Her <span class="building">house</span> was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- " </sentence><sentence id="48">What do I" -- "What herb do I use?". </sentence><sentence id="49">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies" ears. </sentence><sentence id="50">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in <span class="country">America</span> -- leader of the band. </sentence><sentence id="51">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons. </sentence><sentence id="52">She was the teacher of religion in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">Women did not go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> as much as we see here. </sentence><sentence id="54">The men usually went to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, took their sons, taught them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="55">And the woman stayed at <span class="building">home</span>, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage. </sentence><sentence id="56">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation. </sentence><sentence id="57">They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span> -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there. </sentence><sentence id="58">I never remember hate or quarrels. </sentence><sentence id="59">The women visited and the children went to <span class="building">school</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="60">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something. </sentence><sentence id="61">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="62">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="63"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection So, uh, the life didn't have too much change. </sentence><sentence id="64">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was. </sentence><sentence id="65">But my nona's family -- there was one daughter -- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="66">And she was actually considered as a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="67">I mean, she always dreamt of far-away places, she read books that she was not supposed to read. </sentence><sentence id="68">If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first. </sentence><sentence id="69">She was just very, very different. </sentence><sentence id="70">So finally, she talked her family to send her to <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>, which was a thriving -- I mean, big <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time, huh? </sentence><sentence id="71">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="72">Tia is aunt. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="74">It's, as we call it, <span class="building">Lingua De la Madri</span> (ph.), </sentence><sentence id="75">the language of the mother. </sentence><sentence id="76">This was the language in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">You passed the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words. </sentence><sentence id="78">It was only in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="79">Sometimes, we would come <span class="building">home</span> and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back. </sentence><sentence id="80">She would look at me very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="81">She'd say  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection family. </sentence><sentence id="82">Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to <span class="populated place">Sarajevo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she falls in love. </sentence><sentence id="84">She falls in love with a musician. </sentence><sentence id="85">And what did he play? </sentence><sentence id="86">Accordion and guitar. </sentence><sentence id="87">And he had a gorgeous voice. </sentence><sentence id="88">The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider. </sentence><sentence id="89">A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money? </sentence><sentence id="90">I mean, you are blessed with a voice. </sentence><sentence id="91">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money. </sentence><sentence id="92">But you know, nothing would help. </sentence><sentence id="93">And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="94">She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="95">was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel. </sentence><sentence id="96">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a <span class="country">Bosnian</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection about. </sentence><sentence id="97">I never saw him. </sentence><sentence id="98">I don't even know what he looks like. </sentence><sentence id="99">But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="100">The marriages were, really, arranged. </sentence><sentence id="101">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you." </sentence><sentence id="102">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="103">In one way, it was just -- it was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="104">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?". </sentence><sentence id="105">And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs. </sentence><sentence id="106">So every little <span class="populated place">town</span> from the <span class="populated place">Srebenica</span> to <span class="populated place">Travnik</span> as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages. </sentence><sentence id="107">And in between the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, there were such people as <span class="building">Casmententeros</span>, the matchmakers. </sentence><sentence id="108">They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="109">They would match, give parties. </sentence><sentence id="110">So they found a match. </sentence><sentence id="111">And it was a salesman who was traveling from <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">They only spoke in <span class="populated place">Judeo</span>, in <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">The salesman too. </sentence><sentence id="114">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them. </sentence><sentence id="115">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="116">Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="117">Poppel was my father who I never met. </sentence><sentence id="118">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to <span class="populated place">Vlasenica</span>, and meets Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="119">And by golly, she liked him. </sentence><sentence id="120">She was very picky, you know? </sentence><sentence id="121">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman. </sentence><sentence id="122">I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="123">And they arranged a wedding. </sentence><sentence id="124">Naturally, I was not at the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="125">I was sent to play with the cousins. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?". </sentence><sentence id="127">You know. </sentence><sentence id="128">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And they left.

</sentence><sentence id="133"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I adored that woman -- just adored. </sentence><sentence id="135">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="136">It was -- I considered her as my mother. </sentence><sentence id="137">I didn't miss <span class="populated place">Rosa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">It's sad. </sentence><sentence id="139">But that's just the way it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: How old were you when they got married and left for <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Well, before nine. </sentence><sentence id="286">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled. </sentence><sentence id="287">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat. </sentence><sentence id="288">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a . </sentence><sentence id="289">All the Jews in <span class="populated place">Vlasencia</span> and all these little <span class="populated place">towns</span> -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems. </sentence><sentence id="290">You wouldn't know which one's which. </sentence><sentence id="291">They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="292">that's pantaloon pants. </sentence><sentence id="293">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern. </sentence><sentence id="294">He was going to a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">And, oh, it was tough on me. </sentence><sentence id="296">I hated that day. </sentence><sentence id="297">I'll never forget it as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="298">My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts. </sentence><sentence id="299">And she said , don't ever forget your <span

mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else. </sentence><sentence id="302">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes. </sentence><sentence id="303">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="304">This is the kind of life she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="305">She could not take that small, <span class="populated place">village</span> existence. </sentence><sentence id="306">And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that <span class="region">part of the world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">They were modern. </sentence><sentence id="308">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">And socially, this is where she felt more important. </sentence><sentence id="310">The kosher that was completely gone. </sentence><sentence id="311">I don't remember anything that was connected to <span class="populated place">Vlasencica</span> that I could see in her. </sentence><sentence id="312">We did not speak <span class="populated place">Ladino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">It was all <span class="populated place">SerbaCroation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">And not only that. </sentence><sentence id="315">She had so many things prepared for me -- I think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to <span class="building">Maccabi</span> (ph.) -- </sentence><sentence id="316">that's like, a <span class="building">health club</span> -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time. </sentence><sentence id="317">It was too much to take actually. </sentence><sentence id="318">She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language. </sentence><sentence

and everything went down, just from one thing. </sentence><sentence id="325">Every day was a new day of new pain, and new fright, and new disappointment, and waiting for something terrible to happen everyday. </sentence><sentence id="326">The first thing that really killed me is we went to <span class="building">school</span>, the teacher gets up, and she says, "Pinto (ph.), </sentence><sentence

id="333">Zidov means Jew. </sentence><sentence id="334">Then everybody had to bring their <span class="spatial object">radios</span> in. </sentence><sentence id="335">I mean, every day was something frightening. </sentence><sentence id="336">Then comes Wednesday day it was my music day -- music -- and that was, to me, a day I lived for, because I always had my lessons all ready for <span class="populated place">Edat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">And I come to her <span class="dlf">door</span>, and she opens the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and there were two German soldiers

just turned around, and me and my harmonica, my friend, just walked <span class="building">home</span> broken-hearted, just broken-hearted. </sentence><sentence id="346">Since that day, I play only by ear because that was my salvation. </sentence><sentence id="347">Everyday was worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="348">My father had a friend in <span class="populated place">Split</span> -- that's a <span class="region">Dalmation Coast</span> that was under <span class="country">Italy</span> -- and arranged with him successfully to receive some tickets with Gentile names, so we would get
