<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: It's a very small <span class="populated place">town</span>, lying very nicely, geographically, under the <span class="env feature">Tetra (ph) Mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">In other words, when I was young, for instance, you could go ski, you have a already on top of the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="17">It was a very quiet life. </sentence><sentence id="18">Not much excitement. </sentence><sentence id="19">Typical small <span class="populated place">city</span> in the <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">And this lasted until about 1938. </sentence><sentence id="21">Then trouble started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What about the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: There was not a big <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">We had about 300 families. </sentence><sentence id="33">So maybe, total, it was 400 people. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was a <span class="populated place">community</span>, which I think you can compare here to conservative. </sentence><sentence id="35">There were not -- there were maybe only two or three Orthodox people. </sentence><sentence id="36">There was the rabbi, the shamis (ph), and the <span class="spatial object">contors</span> (ph), the cousin. </sentence><sentence id="37">Otherwise, people were . </sentence><sentence id="38">Most <span class="building">stores</span> were -- good <span class="building">stores</span> were closed, but they made business on the <span class="dlf">site</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">For instance, you could go Saturday, shopping, but the front, see, was closed. </sentence><sentence id="40">So you just went through the <span class="dlf">side door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">So, it was really cheating, but that's how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="42">We had very beautiful <span class="building">temples</span> there in our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">We had, we made our own matzos (ph) during the Passover time, right on the <span class="building">school place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">We had a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, <span class="building">Jewish grammar school</span>, which I attended from the age of six until I was <span class="building">Temple</span>, four years. </sentence><sentence id="45">Culturally, we had good cultural programs. </sentence><sentence id="46">We had <span class="building">theater</span>, which played. </sentence><sentence id="47">We had, Sundays, we had outing in the group. </sentence><sentence id="48">There was a large Macarby (ph) group. </sentence><sentence id="49">The Zionist movement was pretty active there. </sentence><sentence id="50">So it was a really very nice little <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Did you mix much with the Christian population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes, we did because at that time, I had very good Christian friends, because mostly after I left the <span class="building">grammar school</span>, I went to the <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, which takes eight years. </sentence><sentence id="74">So you go from 19 -- I graduated 1940 from <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">And there, I met most of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="76">We had very good relationships. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were very close. </sentence><sentence id="78">We went together, we had fun together. </sentence><sentence id="79">And there was no animosity. </sentence><sentence id="80">That all ended, of course, when <span class="country">Slovakia</span> became independent and the situation changed around. </sentence><sentence id="81">But until that time, no problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: My father was -- had an <span class="building">electrical store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">He was a master electrician for many years. </sentence><sentence id="97">He was very well known and he was very busy. </sentence><sentence id="98">He took care of the <span class="building">leather factories</span>, took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="99">Always they should be functioning. </sentence><sentence id="100">And we weren't rich people, but we had -- made a nice living. </sentence><sentence id="101">We also lived in a <span class="building">home</span>, actually, it's two <span class="building">homes</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="102">And we lived in, and next <span class="dlf">door</span> to our <span class="building">house</span> was another <span class="building">house</span> that we rented out. </sentence><sentence id="103">The chief of <span class="populated place">Zhandamarie</span> (ph) was our tenant there. </sentence><sentence id="104">Then, a dental technician was a tenant. </sentence><sentence id="105">And a <span class="building">grocery store</span> was right there. </sentence><sentence id="106">And my father was pretty entrepreneurish. </sentence><sentence id="107">For instance, he built <span class="interior space">garages</span> for <span class="spatial object">cars</span> to park overnight. </sentence><sentence id="108">And we also, in the <span class="building">house</span>, there was a , from the cigarette people who sell cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="109">So it was a busy place. </sentence><sentence id="110">And that was where I brought up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: One other question about this period. </sentence><sentence id="144">You mentioned that there were Zionist Youth movements. </sentence><sentence id="145">Were you involved in these political organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: I wasn't really political, but they <span class="building">sports organizations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">We had outings, we had exercises. </sentence><sentence id="151">It wasn't -- for instance, the was on the agenda, but at this time, I was, you know, not really interested in that because we had a pretty good life there and we never dreamed about a time that it would come. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, it was more a cultural and sport organization than political organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, we knew enough. </sentence><sentence id="160">We had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="161">The <span class="spatial object">radio</span> at that time was still pretty new, but we had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother was still living at that time -- I think it was in April of "34 where the president of <span class="country">Austria</span> was shot. </sentence><sentence id="163">His name was Schuslig (ph), I think. </sentence><sentence id="164">I remember that and we were quite shocked because there was already a from Hitler's party because he wanted to <span class="country">Austria</span> and so, it wasn't good for -- it was how they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="165">And the new president . </sentence><sentence id="166">So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio. </sentence><sentence id="167">And it bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen. </sentence><sentence id="168">We were pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, <span class="country">Slovakia</span> is a free, beautiful, democratic country and we didn't worry much about it. </sentence><sentence id="169">I'm afraid so, in 1939, before <span class="country">Slovakia Republic</span> was born, March 14 in "39, my father got papers to <span class="country">Bolivia</span>, to immigrate. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was official and he could have given the paper right away. </sentence><sentence id="171">But my grandmother was still living , and my mother was already dead, and we didn't see that we could go away and leave her behind. </sentence><sentence id="172">So we figured, we'll ditch these papers to go to <span class="country">Bolivia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="174">And I was still in <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could graduate from <span class="building">high school</span>, from <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was on June 6, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="177">Of course, I always  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 3 wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to <span class="building">medical school</span>, but I was cut out. </sentence><sentence id="178">No Jew could enter <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, what to do, then? </sentence><sentence id="180">I was 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="181">So, I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work. </sentence><sentence id="182">And I was, it seemed, from 19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945. </sentence><sentence id="183">Although in 1944, we already went to the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> to escape, but we will come to it. </sentence><sentence id="184">But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade. </sentence><sentence id="185">And about the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Soon, the Slovak regime started. </sentence><sentence id="187">My father had to give up the business and he had to be political party zealot (ph). </sentence><sentence id="188">An Audian (ph) person, had to take over. </sentence><sentence id="189">He was the boss. </sentence><sentence id="190">He took the money. </sentence><sentence id="191">And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on. </sentence><sentence id="192">That was from 19 -- if | remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="193">So my father was employed, I was employed, but we stayed <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">We did not go. </sentence><sentence id="195">Now, my sister, she was a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="196">She was very good at it. </sentence><sentence id="197">And she worked for a Slovak company at a job. </sentence><sentence id="198">By 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all girls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be taken to a <span class="populated place">working place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions, but many of the girls came. </sentence><sentence id="200">They had about two weeks notice. </sentence><sentence id="201">But at that time, you didn't know yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it. </sentence><sentence id="202">They came there and stayed overnight in the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">And the next day, they were taken by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Poprat</span> (ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">Now, we didn't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="205">We knew nothing about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="206">Now, there were some parents who were a little bit smarter than we were. </sentence><sentence id="207">And when they got the notice, they send their daughters to <span class="building">hospital</span> for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="208">As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">She's married here to an American boy. </sentence><sentence id="210">But my father,we tried to talk, I must say, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of the " was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and which took care of all the Jewish problems. </sentence><sentence id="211">And my father went to this -- to help this girl to beg that they shouldn't take my sister. </sentence><sentence id="212">But they did not worry about it -- just didn't want to talk to my father about it. </sentence><sentence id="213">And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we made because they left of March 27, 1942, from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, <span class="populated place">Nicholage</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="214">And on April the 2nd, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> took them from the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Poprat</span> (ph) to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">We never heard of her anymore. </sentence><sentence id="216">And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated . </sentence><sentence id="217">So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family. </sentence><sentence id="218">But we stayed on. </sentence><sentence id="219">And the tragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called economic exemption. </sentence><sentence id="220">That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn't even have to wear the , the <span class="spatial object">Star</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">We didn't have to wear it. </sentence><sentence id="222">We could travel, but the condition was we needed to be <span class="building">home</span> by 6:00 at night. </sentence><sentence id="223">We couldn't go to a movie. </sentence><sentence id="224">We couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have a radio. </sentence><sentence id="225">If the family had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, it was a big punishment for that. </sentence><sentence id="226">And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until the uprising took in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, which was August 29, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="227">The uprising took place in a <span class="populated place">city</span> called , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">There were some politicists, landing down (ph), some from <span class="country">Russia</span>, some from the <span class="building">brigade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> with <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and quite a few army people. </sentence><sentence id="230">In our <span class="populated place">town</span>, there was a <span class="building">German station</span> of about 10 or  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 4 12 men who managed a <span class="building">telegraph station</span> for . </sentence><sentence id="231">This partisan and the army came to a place, that was in a <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">They surprised these men. </sentence><sentence id="233">They shot them all. . </sentence><sentence id="234">It was the president of -- for their interruptions. </sentence><sentence id="235">The front didn't have any more connections to our <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">Because we knew that if something had happened, that there would be murder. </sentence><sentence id="237">I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the Germans might (ph) kill them. </sentence><sentence id="238">So, we didn't know, of course, at least, something bad had happened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our <span class="populated place">town</span> and go to the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, because <span class="populated place">Nicholage</span> (ph), my <span class="populated place">home town</span> lies right on the top of a <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">So, about a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="240">He was acommunist. </sentence><sentence id="241">And he built us a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, about three kilometers from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">Please ask me if you have a question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="330">Actually, I don't wan to -- I want to go back a little bit before we talk about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: I'm curious what happened between 1938 and 1942. </sentence><sentence id="336">That's a big chunk of time, considering what was happening in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">So, what was happening in your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took <span class="country">Slovakia</span> and was divided in <span class="country">Bohemia</span>, <span class="region">Moravia</span> and <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342"><span class="country">Slovakia</span> became autonomous. </sentence><sentence id="343">That means, the president was still the president of both <span class="country">countries</span>, but autonomy , but they still went to <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">Then, as I say, from October 6th to March 14, 1939, when <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, under the , it will become independent state, that was completely bought from <span class="region">Bohemia and Moravia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">It became <span class="building">Slovenkis Shtat</span> (ph), <span class="region">Slovak State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">The president of our <span class="country">country</span> became a Dr.Joseph Tiso, who was a Catholic priest and he, as a minister/president, he had person called Dr. Voitisch Toka (ph), who was a lawyer, but also, they were all Nazis, what we call sympathizers with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="347">And from that moment on, from March 14th, the rules and regulations came out, restricting. </sentence><sentence id="348">They said you couldn't be on the <span class="dlf">street</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="349">You couldn't have a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">You couldn't have watches. </sentence><sentence id="351">You had to give up any gold or any jewel you had. </sentence><sentence id="352">You'd get a piece of paper that -- to get the things out. </sentence><sentence id="353">But you liberty was restricted. </sentence><sentence id="354">You had to be <span class="building">home</span> in time. </sentence><sentence id="355">You couldn't own anything. </sentence><sentence id="356">You could [not] have your own <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">You're either to work for somebody or you were just out of business. </sentence><sentence id="358">That was in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="359">But there was a as I started <span class="building">school</span>, until the first deportation took place from <span class="populated place">town</span>, and that was in 1941 for certain people who were claimed to be communists were at night -- police came at night, took these people away, and they were never seen since -- never came back. </sentence><sentence id="360">That was in "41. </sentence><sentence id="361">My father -- we still had to at the time, yet. </sentence><sentence id="362">But because he was an electrician, they needed him, so they let him work. </sentence><sentence id="363">He was under the control of the men who are in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">But we could work. </sentence><sentence id="365">But every day, some new regulations came that were tougher and tougher and tougher, until the time came when, of course, people started to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="366">Not political, but deported to so-called work. " </sentence><sentence id="367">You will go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">You will help the <span class="building">government</span> to survive. </sentence><sentence id="369">And you'll be fed. </sentence><sentence id="370">And you'll even get -- everything will be fine." </sentence><sentence id="371">Did I say that time when my sister was taken in "<span class="populated place">42</span>? </sentence><sentence id="372"> USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: You said "42. </sentence><sentence id="407">Was there any German presence? </sentence><sentence id="408">Or everything was controlled by the Slovakian government? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: There was Slovakian government, but there were <span class="building">German offices</span> in the <span class="populated place">capital city</span> of <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, which is <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">There was a person, a German person called , who was the ambassador there. </sentence><sentence id="414">And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done. </sentence><sentence id="415">But locally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as <span class="building">Euchre</span> (ph), but officially, everything was controlled by the Slovak. </sentence><sentence id="416">But the hundred or so were German. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: The other question is, you had a lot of Christian and Catholic friends, I assume, before this took place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: You're right. </sentence><sentence id="433">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: What happened to those friends afterwards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
