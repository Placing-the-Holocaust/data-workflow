<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: We, we knew that of course there is a Batar(ph) that organized everything, but we have very little communication with them, so and besides that, as I said, there was no way of moving around, so each one just stayed in it's <span class="interior space">quarters</span> until we were allowed to go to, on, on the <span class="interior space">deck</span> for a, for a, for a short time and then back there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: So basically everything that you knew about the trip, during the trip, was by way of rumors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Exactly, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: So what happened when you got closer to <span class="populated place">Istanbul</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: When we got closer to <span class="populated place">Istanbul</span>, the <span class="spatial object">engine</span> stopped working and the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was floating, you know, towards the, the <span class="dlf">shore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">It was right in the other opening of the <span class="dlf">Bosporus(ph) Straights</span> and the rumor was that we were too close to <span class="dlf">mines</span>, because the Turkish </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: So you are not close to the <span class="env feature">shore</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: No, we were pretty far away from both <span class="env feature">shores</span>, but anchored right there in the <span class="region">middle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">And of course we had then, Turkish police came on board and they came, they were constantly on board the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> and we stayed there for about two months. </sentence><sentence id="228">From what we understand, that the Turks will not allow us to go into the <span class="env feature">Mediterranean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">We couldn't go forward, we couldn't go backwards and the engines were irreparable on board <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">So finally I understand, we got permission for mechanics to come on board, remove the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>, take it ashore and try to repair it ashore. </sentence><sentence id="231">So they removed the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: So, if my understanding is correct, one of the problems was that you, you, the passengers didn't have an immigration visa for <span class="country">Palestine</span>, correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Right, first we did not have any immigration visa for <span class="country">Palestine</span>, secondly we had no visas for <span class="country">Turkey</span>, we were not allowed to get out of the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> and we had to stay aboard until somehow they would manage to repair the engine. </sentence><sentence id="241">Meanwhile of course there were all kinds of rumors that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="242">First, rumors that maybe there is a chance that they childrens will be allowed to disembark. </sentence><sentence id="243">And there were quite a lot of children on <span class="spatial object">board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then there were rumored that maybe they will allow us, they will make a <span class="populated place">camp</span> on the <span class="region">Asian side</span> of the <span class="country">Turkey</span> and allow us to stay there, until somehow it will be resolved what to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="245">All these things never materialized, neither the children, neither going on <span class="spatial object">board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">But, what did happen is that finally nine people that were on board with expired immigration papers for <span class="country">Palestine</span>, they got permission to be taken out of the <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> and then to be, to proceed to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">So the nine people, nine person disembark, were allowed to disembark during those two months that we stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
