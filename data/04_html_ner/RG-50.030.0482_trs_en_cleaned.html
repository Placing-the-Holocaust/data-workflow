<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in <span class="populated place">North London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">My father was born in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">My mother was born in the <span class="country">UK</span>, in <span class="country">England</span>, of course, as it was then. </sentence><sentence id="8">Their parents came from <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Russia</span> respectively. </sentence><sentence id="9">Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually born, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me, <span class="populated place">Oswiecim</span>, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">And that sent shivers down our spine many years later. </sentence><sentence id="11">Now, it wasn't a happy <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">My father was an accountant. </sentence><sentence id="13">He was a very obsessional man, and during most of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="14">So I grew up in the years of unemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism. </sentence><sentence id="15">And I think this combination absorbed my father completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary. </sentence><sentence id="16">He could see, I believe, what was going to happen in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of other languages, and I've never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was quite simply educated in this <span class="country">country</span>, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages he did, and how he could be bilingual in German. </sentence><sentence id="18">I never understood that, and I don't now, but he was. </sentence><sentence id="19">So, as an only child, in a <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">north London</span>, with diminishing financial resources, as my father's activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> became more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active. </sentence><sentence id="20">And as I was exposed to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection his version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and indeed, in <span class="country">England</span> where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely's fascists marching through <span class="populated place">north London</span>, and the east end of <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">I'm losing my thread, but what I'm trying to do is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a <span class="region">working class area</span>, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous <span class="building">house</span> to something very modest. </sentence><sentence id="24">Was a - - a -- a kind of <span class="building">house</span> of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might happen in the future. </sentence><sentence id="25">My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from <span class="country">Germany</span>, which he would translate. </sentence><sentence id="26">So that as a young child, I -- | was exposed to quite a lot of my father's understanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own. </sentence><sentence id="27">N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all this by -- and it wasn't that she didn't care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h -- and as is always the case, she actually couldn't face the possibility of what might happen. </sentence><sentence id="28">She began to disengage as much as she could. </sentence><sentence id="29">As my father's activities became, as I said earlier, more -- more active, there were refugees from <span class="country">Germany</span> who came to our <span class="building">house</span>, en route perhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my <span class="building">house</span> for some days, weeks, and -- and as a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was bedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="30">And they -- there were -- people who came and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and talk to me, but they wouldn't talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and i -- yo-you know, celebration. </sentence><sentence id="31">It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much. </sentence><sentence id="33">I found him pompous, although he played beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="34">And he came and sat on my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> frequently. </sentence><sentence id="35">But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="36">He said to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="37">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="38"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection me, "You know, you don't have to be ill like this. </sentence><sentence id="39">If you want to, you can get out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span> when I leave this <span class="interior space">room</span>, and you can walk round the <span class="interior space">room</span>, touch all the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, and get back into <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself." </sentence><sentence id="40">Now, I disliked him more than ever when he said this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. </sentence><sentence id="41">But I did exactly what he said. </sentence><sentence id="42">I got up and I walked round the <span class="interior space">room</span>, and I touched everything, and I said to myself. " </sentence><sentence id="43">I can make changes, I can be in control." </sentence><sentence id="44">I wasn't very confident, but I said it. </sentence><sentence id="45">And I don't know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father's outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don't want to magnify it. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was very moved by my father. </sentence><sentence id="95">I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came. </sentence><sentence id="96">But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother's social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don't know, something very special. </sentence><sentence id="97">Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="98">But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. </sentence><sentence id="99">Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced. </sentence><sentence id="100">But it was an unhappy <span class="building">household</span>, and I'm not sure that I -- I mean, | think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. </sentence><sentence id="101">I'm not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and in terms of parenting. </sentence><sentence id="102">I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy <span class="building">household</span>, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise. </sentence><sentence id="103">And these, I think, are skills I have. </sentence><sentence id="104">And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the <span class="building">family home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in <span class="populated place">London</span> during the war. </sentence><sentence id="118">Tell me about what that experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="121"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="122">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="123"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. </sentence><sentence id="125">What can I say about it? </sentence><sentence id="126">In some ways, it was almost -- it's crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation. </sentence><sentence id="127">So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in <span class="populated place">central London</span>, when <span class="populated place">central London</span> was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- it wasn't as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn't hurt. </sentence><sentence id="128">I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a <span class="building">solicitor's office</span>, and standing on some <span class="dlf">steps</span>, going down to the <span class="interior space">basement</span> where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I was going -- there was only about four or five <span class="dlf">steps</span>, but as I stood on the <span class="dlf">top step</span>, the <span class="dlf">steps</span> collapsed under me. </sentence><sentence id="130">And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn't being particularly chosen at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="131">And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it's reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably <span class="interior space">left wing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">Did a lot of work in the <span class="region">east end</span> of <span class="populated place">London</span>, working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely's fascists. </sentence><sentence id="133">And she was involved in the much glorified battle of <span class="dlf">Cable Street</span>, which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular <span class="region">area</span> of the <span class="region">east end</span>, the people of the <span class="region">east end</span> brought out all their <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, their -- their <span class="spatial object">pianos</span>, their -- their <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, their <span class="spatial object">kitchen equipment</span>, and they blocked the <span class="dlf">roads</span> of the <span class="region">east end</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in <span class="country">Europe</span>, this simple act meant a great deal to me. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn't succeed ultimately This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="136">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="137"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection in making a stand, in making a statement. </sentence><sentence id="138">So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair. </sentence><sentence id="139">She was vigorous, she was sexy. </sentence><sentence id="140">She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. </sentence><sentence id="141">She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things. </sentence><sentence id="142">An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fiance, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the <span class="building">Cafe de Paris</span> had a direct hit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: <span class="building">Cafe de Paris</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: The cafe de p -- ki -- the <span class="building">Cafe de P-Paris</span> was a very famous <span class="building">cafe</span> for dancing, many soldiers and people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive, but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe. </sentence><sentence id="167">I don't know why people talk about something being absolutely safe. </sentence><sentence id="168">It had a direct hit. </sentence><sentence id="169">Her body was never found, and I remember going with my mother to try and identify various <span class="spatial object">objects</span> that were lined up somewhere in the middle of <span class="populated place">London</span> where people queued and looked at these <span class="spatial object">objects</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="177">When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in -- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective. </sentence><sentence id="181">He had read men ka -- "Mein Kampf," he had read other documents. </sentence><sentence id="182">The information actually was there for anyone who wanted to know it. </sentence><sentence id="183">Members of <span class="building">parliament</span> denied all knowledge of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and people -- I think including my father, but I'm not sure about this -- did lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don't think that - - that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation. </sentence><sentence id="184">And maybe for This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="185">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="186"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection other reasons as well. </sentence><sentence id="187">So I always knew, I always knew about the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">It was no secret in my <span class="building">house</span> that people were being taken to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and murdered. </sentence><sentence id="189">We weren't -- I -- I don't always know -- now when I look back, it's difficult to be accurate. </sentence><sentence id="190">Whether the details were known, I'm not su -- to me, I'm not sure, but certainly the word <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">So it wasn't a stranger to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: What years are we talking about here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: I'm talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war years. </sentence><sentence id="209">The forties. </sentence><sentence id="210">The 1941, "42, 43, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and <span class="populated place">London</span> was being bombed, my father was talking about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">An exhibition of photographs from the <span class="populated place">camps</span> which had a very profound impact on you. </sentence><sentence id="216">Can you recall how old you were when you went to see that <span class="spatial object">exhibition</span> and what -- what stayed in your mind from that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that's right, there was an exhibition of photographs that was shown in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">It wasn't the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people. </sentence><sentence id="222">And I think that if I'm not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people's reactions. </sentence><sentence id="223">Now, I'm not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn't really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="224">And to bring <span class="building">home</span> to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that -- to that extent, I think either didn't move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn't -- I don't think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="225">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="226"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection real under -- |-let's say how difficult it was for anyone to understand what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="227">It wasn't the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to <span class="country">Germany</span> at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="228">I think that I'd started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I'm -- and in -- it's very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. </sentence><sentence id="229">People often ask me why did I want to go to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="230">And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn't only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. </sentence><sentence id="231">He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="232">But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. </sentence><sentence id="233">And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. </sentence><sentence id="234">And so I suppose it was my father's knowledge, and my aunt's kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you're waving your arms and nobody's watching, do it, was what she was about. </sentence><sentence id="235">I think that's really what influenced me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Do you remember actually taking this decision? </sentence><sentence id="255">And how old were you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: I found an organization called the <span class="building">Jewish Relief Unit</span>, that was in formation before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="259">I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they announced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they'd consider me. </sentence><sentence id="260">And I joined the <span class="building">relief unit</span> in the hope that I would be able to go. </sentence><sentence id="261">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="262">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="263"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="271">Could you tell me what the <span class="spatial object">unit</span> consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: The <span class="building">Jewish Relief Unit</span> when I first came upon it was a small <span class="building">office</span> near <span class="building">Woburn House</span> in that <span class="dlf">square</span>, <span class="dlf">Woburn Square</span>, or <span class="dlf">Ensley Place</span> I think was it's name. </sentence><sentence id="275">It was a -- a <span class="building">house</span> on a <span class="dlf">corner</span>, and it consisted of an <span class="building">office</span> with about six or seven people in it. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was financed, I think, by the -- now I'm not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot remember. </sentence><sentence id="277">This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. </sentence><sentence id="278">I do have a book about it, but I don't read the book, and I'm not sure why. </sentence><sentence id="279">But anyway, there is a lot of information about the funding of this organization. </sentence><sentence id="280">And there were people being trained to go. </sentence><sentence id="281">And these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to go, as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="282">And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then living with my mother;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2059">A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic, but what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody's hand. </sentence><sentence id="2060">I -- I found that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work. </sentence><sentence id="2061">When there's nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody's hand This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2062">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2063"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 and stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication. </sentence><sentence id="2064">So you don't begin with words, you begin with touch, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2065">And sometimes I would just walk away. </sentence><sentence id="2066">And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. </sentence><sentence id="2067">But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody's hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. </sentence><sentence id="2068">So that was all I could do sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Words came later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

their strength, their capacity to work another day. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. </sentence><sentence id="2363">So in

have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. </sentence><sentence id="2384">And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here. </sentence><sentence id="2385">I believe that these young people -- and I've said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the

I don't believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. </sentence><sentence id="2404">It's easy to say that in hindsight. </sentence><sentence id="2405">I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children. </sentence><sentence id="2406">But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don't want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. </sentence><sentence id="2407">So,

he -- we don't know what happened, and I still to this day don't know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman

outrage and compassion when the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was liberated, but I watched it die. </sentence><sentence id="2901">I watched it not there when I came back.

there won't be that compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2909">The compassion has died. </sentence><sentence id="2910">And so I don't know what maintains compassion. </sentence><sentence id="2911">And
