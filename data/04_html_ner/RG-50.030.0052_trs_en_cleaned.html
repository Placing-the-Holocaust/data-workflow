<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: About your childhood. </sentence><sentence id="52">When you were...uh...a young boy...uh...I'd like to know a little bit about what life was like for you and your parents as a young...as a young...when you were a young boy in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: You see, when I was 6 years old, then I started the <span class="building">grammar school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">Yet in...in 1918, we..we are very unhappy because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="57">And my father was convoked to the army as the officer because he was ordered the <span class="building">school</span>, and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle  between German...German and Russian soldiers, he was taken into Russian captivity already in 1915 and he was there, which he knew Russian of course, so his conditions of life were not so difficult there. </sentence><sentence id="58">And the...the Russians have esteemed him and used him rather for the more secretarial work, not handwork. </sentence><sentence id="59">In 1918, he benefited and profited by the...uh...disorder because of the Russian Revolution and the __. </sentence><sentence id="60">You see, just by his judgment he knew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when <span class="country">Poland</span> became independent, he also had to enter the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="61">But after some months he came back <span class="building">home</span> and continued his business work. </sentence><sentence id="62">He was an exporter of food to greater <span class="populated place">cities</span>, also to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, during the occupation of <span class="country">Poland</span> by Germans. </sentence><sentence id="63">And so our conditions of life were rather good and we had the opportunity to be developed really in the atmosphere of a loving family. </sentence><sentence id="64">And when other members, my brothers and sisters heard about the my life's decision that I will go to priesthood, then they also sympathized with me and helped me really to reach that priesthood by their sympathy, by their prayers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="65">And so...and....uh...uh...in 1920, I went to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> of <span class="populated place">Naklo</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> and...uh...there I was 2 years and then transferred to <span class="populated place">Wadowice</span> to the <span class="building">high school</span> of my society. </sentence><sentence id="66">And...uh...it was in the dioceses of <span class="populated place">Krakau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">And...uh...then after I had finished the <span class="building">high school</span>, I entered the <span class="building">preparatory school</span> for priesthood and...uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: What made you decide to go on and to enter the <span class="building">preparatory school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="83">Why did you become a priest? </sentence><sentence id="84">Want to become a priest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: You see there was in me some conviction that this is my way of life. </sentence><sentence id="89">It was not my decision, strictly speaking or theologically speaking, but some preparation from above. </sentence><sentence id="90">You see, we do believe in...uh...in our faith that all the vocations of priesthood for religious life come from God himself. </sentence><sentence id="91">And no doubt in order that this cause may mature, you may live a very dignified and religious also family. </sentence><sentence id="92">My parents were very faithful members of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">All my brothers and sisters too. </sentence><sentence id="94">It was really the proper atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="95">Also helping to deepen my conviction, there is my place. </sentence><sentence id="96">And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to <span class="populated place">Rome</span> to the <span class="building">University</span> to studv theoloov and._uh .to get a doctor decree in  Pastoral care of all Poles in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for the Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them. </sentence><sentence id="98">Traveling from place after place during summer. </sentence><sentence id="99">It was some days in which I remember some <span class="populated place">Polish parish</span> has celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And then ..then when the war came, ___ to <span class="country">France</span>, 1939, we have really also suffered much. </sentence><sentence id="101">And then...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...<span class="country">Germany</span> has occupied <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">And._.uh. </sentence><sentence id="103">here really is mv creat. </sentence><sentence id="104">I would sav. </sentence><sentence id="105">for for martvrdom  approach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person. </sentence><sentence id="106">So they considered me as an Enemy No. </sentence><sentence id="107">1. </sentence><sentence id="108">And then from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> after 1 month of being in <span class="building">prison</span>, I was just transferred...transferred to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and on my way to in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I was few days in <span class="populated place">Trier</span>, ___, <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>, and came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on December the 10, 1940...1940 to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, __. </sentence><sentence id="109">And really that in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was a place of torture. </sentence><sentence id="110">And...uh...you see no freedom. </sentence><sentence id="111">Just closed in the <span class="interior space">cell</span> and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some part in the of all the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="112">Twice a month I was able to leave the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">Otherwise, <span class="interior space">cell</span> was my unique, only place to live. </sentence><sentence id="114">But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I was really taken into the <span class="interior space">black cell</span>, that is to say without a light, without a light, without water, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days. </sentence><sentence id="115">That is to say, imagine only you have no possibility to look through the <span class="dlf">window</span> because everything was closed. </sentence><sentence id="116">You didn't have any possibility to take <span class="env feature">water</span> or some...take some food because they didn't bring it to you. </sentence><sentence id="117">After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="118">But this was not sufficient for them. </sentence><sentence id="119">You see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated me so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living any more, but to be sure they took me to the <span class="building">hospital</span> where conditions were certainly not easy but better than the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">So after some days I have recuperated and then they have taken me back to the . </sentence><sentence id="121">But with more normal conditions of life. </sentence><sentence id="122">That is to say, I have received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the <span class="building">Priminate</span> twice a month. </sentence><sentence id="123">And from ____ I was from December 10, 40. </sentence><sentence id="124">On July 29, 41, I left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and then transferred to the <span class="dlf">camn</span> of <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> close to  <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> for him was an organized <span class="region">Hell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And you see if somebody very intelligent person really writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in <span class="populated place">Hell</span>, without any hope, without peace, without liberty. </sentence><sentence id="126">You have been considered just there as a <span class="spatial object">mechanical instrument</span>, moved here and there. </sentence><sentence id="127">And...uh...in my case as the Polish priest, also, we had to work everyday in this so called plantation. </sentence><sentence id="128">And the...the work was really not easy and then every day, every day the same work. </sentence><sentence id="129">And without enough food. </sentence><sentence id="130">And then with the spirit of persecution you see. </sentence><sentence id="131">All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work, we our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say...uh...against all of us. </sentence><sentence id="132">Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see. </sentence><sentence id="133">And we did when they have...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best. </sentence><sentence id="134">When they disappeared, we just relaxed. </sentence><sentence id="135">And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us. </sentence><sentence id="136">And you see, some Gestapo people were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness. </sentence><sentence id="137">And many people beaten, and the <span class="dlf">plantation</span> had to be transferred to the so-called <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And there the Gestapo men finished them. </sentence><sentence id="139">You see, there was a <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">I was there also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs. </sentence><sentence id="141">And...uh...we didn't have the true conditions which a sick person should have in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">You see, they treated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the proper food. </sentence><sentence id="143">But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and peace of heart. </sentence><sentence id="144">How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions? </sentence><sentence id="145">And I answered just by your faith. </sentence><sentence id="146">You see, if you believed in God, in his not only justice, but also Law, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to us, it is also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the other people. </sentence><sentence id="147">And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some suffering. </sentence><sentence id="148">St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to God that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete also that suffering by giving our part. </sentence><sentence id="149">And so if you have such faith that your suffering really can bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength to survive. </sentence><sentence id="150">And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you. </sentence><sentence id="151">It can break you if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of suffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can make you stronger. </sentence><sentence id="152">The more so stronger if you are a believer. </sentence><sentence id="153">If you think that everything is under the divine control. </sentence><sentence id="154">And in this faith and in this spirit you can really energize also your body and bring more peace for your daily life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: How did that help you in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>? </sentence><sentence id="225">What was in...in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, how did your faith help you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="228">What...what kind of things did you do in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">If your faith was not firm. </sentence><sentence id="231">Why? </sentence><sentence id="232">Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has also given to the German priest a <span class="building">chapel</span>, and they had the possibility to have their prayers, devotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were allowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the <span class="building">chapel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">But here the danger for some people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended  to go to the <span class="building">chapel</span> and pray a little. </sentence><sentence id="234">But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to the order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a <span class="building">chapel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And so the lay people said, "Well, how can I believe if this minister of God is so cruel just not to allow me to go to the <span class="building">chapel</span> for a spiritual comfort? </sentence><sentence id="236">and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way. </sentence><sentence id="237">We have to answer. " </sentence><sentence id="238">There are also people amone the nriest who act not according to their  us. </sentence><sentence id="239">And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came intact without corruption. </sentence><sentence id="240">And then from other members of families, here and there there was food and damage by this or other conditions. </sentence><sentence id="241">And so one idea came to a priest and he composed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really giving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family also, but especially to our mothers. </sentence><sentence id="242">And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology, and came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love for a God. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with the food, really made us more normal people. </sentence><sentence id="244">And...uh.. when I was also in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> in...uh...in the <span class="building">hospital</span> for some days, one priest was dying and called, "Mother," in such despair. " </sentence><sentence id="245">My dearest Mother." </sentence><sentence id="246">I approached him and told him, "Father, be consoled. </sentence><sentence id="247">You will find the blessed mother in <span class="dlf">Heaven</span>." </sentence><sentence id="248">And he said, "Father, do you understand the deep love of a dying person fora mother?" </sentence><sentence id="249">And I said, "Well, I was not in this state of dying yet, but I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of life." </sentence><sentence id="250">You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for a mother, and the love of Mother for us. </sentence><sentence id="251">Mother lives for her children. </sentence><sentence id="252">Not always children live for their mothers. </sentence><sentence id="253">But our suffering, for example, in this case in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> really renewed in us the worthiness. </sentence><sentence id="254">There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our mother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an extent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us. </sentence><sentence id="255">So then came the blessed day of...uh...April 29. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Can we hold it a minute. </sentence><sentence id="284">I would like not to get to the liberation yet. </sentence><sentence id="285">I would like to go back for a moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: You have mentioned being in the <span class="building">hospital</span> several times. </sentence><sentence id="292">Could you tell us about the events that led up to your being in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and you told me an extraordinary story before. </sentence><sentence id="293">Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: You see, when we speak of the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> then we should not believe that the name of <span class="building">hospital</span> was identical with the conditions of a <span class="building">civilized hospital</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="296">You were there only an <span class="spatial object">instrument</span>...uh...which really received here...here and there some care, but most minimal. </sentence><sentence id="297">When you came to <span class="building">hospital</span>, then all the people who took care of the sick people believed you came here to die. </sentence><sentence id="298">And so if you didn't have the interior strength and the...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to survive that. </sentence><sentence id="299">And so many people really died there and how many? </sentence><sentence id="300">Well, for example, in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> 868 Polish priests perished. </sentence><sentence id="301">Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in the medical experiments, by torture in the <span class="building">prison</span> __. </sentence><sentence id="302">And the Polish clergy <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> order no.clergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718. </sentence><sentence id="303">And as I already told you, 868 were...died, and was martyred, of course. </sentence><sentence id="304">And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests slowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent that they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>  has ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood. </sentence><sentence id="305">You see, unheard... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: Did you see the ordination? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Yes, I...we did. </sentence><sentence id="320">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="324">Please. </sentence><sentence id="325">Put...put that down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was ordained by the French Bishop. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Tell us about that ordination as you saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Well. </sentence><sentence id="336">for us it was ereat <span class="dlf">dav</span> not onlv because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: You had said also you were in the <span class="building">hospital</span> another time for your legs. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="339">That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Could you tell us about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there. </sentence><sentence id="345">There had seen what happened and given me some...uh...] would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the wounds. </sentence><sentence id="346">I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if you...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to overcome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">You see when you speak of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, then you just cannot think of normal conditions of human life. </sentence><sentence id="348">The more so of the proper conditions in the <span class="building">hospitals</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">They had to reopen also <span class="building">hospitals</span> you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion also. </sentence><sentence id="350">So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, then they just try also to visit or show here we also <span class="building">hospital</span> we care of the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us, to ask how do you feel. </sentence><sentence id="351">And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see. </sentence><sentence id="352">But really inhuman conditions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="363">Were you...uh...ever beaten and tortured in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="367">This was the case. </sentence><sentence id="368">And so, for example, if...if 1 was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="369">Perhaps because I was priest. </sentence><sentence id="370">But they didn't assist me. </sentence><sentence id="371">You had to just take care of yourself. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="372">And other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture. </sentence><sentence id="373">Many, many people really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to them that they had to finish their life. </sentence><sentence id="374">So conditions which were not human you see, and because of this vou can understand whv the manv also writers. </sentence><sentence id="375">as I have quoted _ the  0 TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Let us go back. </sentence><sentence id="379">If you would put that down. </sentence><sentence id="380">I would like to ask you now that the tape is on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
