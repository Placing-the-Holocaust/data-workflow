<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Tell me about growing up in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">What was it like? </sentence><sentence id="29">What did your parents do? </sentence><sentence id="30">What was it like to be a child in that <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Well, I was an only child. </sentence><sentence id="36">Had no brothers and sisters and I had my grandparents there. </sentence><sentence id="37">I had my mother's both parents and my father's mother. </sentence><sentence id="38">And we had friends. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">Went to, to four years of uh <span class="building">public school</span> and then uh to up to four years you have to made a, a decision what kind of schooling you want. </sentence><sentence id="41">You have to, you can go either go on to the <span class="interior space">unit</span> to the <span class="building">public school</span> or you can go to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> (ph) and there were also two choices. </sentence><sentence id="42">You can go to a <span class="building">humanistic gymnasium</span> where they learn Latin and Greek and little mathematics and little science or you could go to the other <span class="building">school</span> where I went. </sentence><sentence id="43">We had, we started right away with French and the sciences. </sentence><sentence id="44">No Latin or Greek but French, modern languages, French and later English. </sentence><sentence id="45">But you had to go to <span class="building">school</span> very little was exams, even then at ten years of age we had a whole day of exam to be able to get into this <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">So I passed that exam and I went to the <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">That was already uh shortly before Hitler came to power so I went to the <span class="building">Catholic school</span> for girls only. </sentence><sentence id="48">And uh, I think right after, I don't know, must have been right afterwards that Hitler came to power and the anti-Semitism started right away and then I had trouble with some children. </sentence><sentence id="49">Some children stayed with me and became very close friends and said don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="50">But others started right away, I don't want to sit next to the Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="51">I don't want to the Jews smell and I don't want to sit with her and they had uh religious instructions. </sentence><sentence id="52">You know in the <span class="building">Catholic school</span> especially they had a lot of religion and of course we didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had still a religious, a Jewish uh teacher come to the <span class="building">school</span> and we had extra, different uh religious instruction. </sentence><sentence id="54">So that set us apart uh right away and uh, but in the beginning it wasn't too bad you know. </sentence><sentence id="55">In in 1933, "34 it wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="56">As a matter of fact I was a pretty good athlete in sports, you know, sports and Hitler put a lot of emphasis on sports so, I think in 1935 or so they uh had like little Olympics for young people and all over <span class="country">Germany</span> they had to come and do a certain program and if you passed that program you got a certificate. </sentence><sentence id="57">So that swimming in  clothes and a uh certain distance and we had to jump from a <span class="spatial object">ten meter board</span> and had to run and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="58">And when you passed it I got a little, I got a certificate signed by Hitler that I passed that thing, so it wasn't you know, and the <span class="building">Catholic school</span>, the the uh principal was a lady and she was very much for us and helped us overcome these things. </sentence><sentence id="59">But after a couple of years or so she called me into the <span class="building">office</span> or called my parents and said they are no longer able to keep us in the <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">I either have to leave the <span class="building">school</span> altogether or go to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">So luckily we had in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> a very good <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had actually two <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> and this <span class="building">gymnasium</span> was accredited like any other <span class="building">school</span> like here the <span class="building">Jewish Hebrew Academy</span> that is accredited now. </sentence><sentence id="63">And II knew a little bit of Hebrew but I was always very ambitious so I, I had, I took tutoring to get better in Hebrew so I could be up to par with the other kids who had started there. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had a lot of Hebrew, a lot of but all the other subjects I started where my English we had a very good English teacher and he was a stickler for uh grammatic and we learned very well the irregular verbs and all those things so we had a very good schooling there. </sentence><sentence id="65">That was only two years I think you know but it was very intensive and very good. </sentence><sentence id="66">And uh I was a member of the Zionist youth movement there which, I don't know and uh we had meetings and we had outings but I was the private, I was the single daughter so my father was always protective and I couldn't go very much to outings and to things but I went to meetings and uh we talked about youth going to <span class="country">Israel</span> and to , to you know these little <span class="dlf">cans</span> where we were prepared to live in <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span> but uh they wouldn't give me the permit and the permit and so finally I, one day I said I have to go <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the Zionist movement and see what's the trouble. </sentence><sentence id="67">So I went there all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="68">We had family in, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> that I stayed with, and here they told me they can't give me the certificate, can't give me the permission to go because of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="69">The eyes have to I am very nearsighted and uh they are afraid that if I do agricultural work, if I stoop very much that I'm going to have, my retina is going to uh depart, separate from the eye and they wouldn't give me, they have to have consultations and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="70">So I couldn't, I couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="71">So when I had to leave the <span class="building">school</span> and my parents knew that we're going to have to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> you know pretty soon, in <span class="country">Germany</span> was the custom that almost every, every middle-class family had a maid. </sentence><sentence id="72">So the kids would grow up, we didn't do very much. </sentence><sentence id="73">We didn't know very much of household work and cooking and things like that, so my mother said you have to learn because we're certainly not going to have a maid any longer. </sentence><sentence id="74">So they sent me to <span class="populated place">Hausen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="75">That was a <span class="building">Jewish household school</span> near <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and uh, I went there from in April, the German school year goes from April to April, not from September like here. </sentence><sentence id="76">I went in April and I came back for some vacation in the summer . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: What year is this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: This was in 1938, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="123">Yeah, "38. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="127">You are how old? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Fif... I was born in "23 so fifteen, fifteen, sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="129">And us that was clear across <span class="country">Germany</span> near <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">From <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> was quite a ... and uh I went back in September and in early November uh they had this uh in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> on this on this ambassador </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="134"> so you know what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="135">On the ninth of November we were sitting near the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and we were listening and we knew something terrible is going to happen but we didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="136">And we were there, all young kids, young girls and uh so sure enough on the tenth of November that year the police came and the SS came to wake us up at six o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="137">Out, out, out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">You couldn't take anything only the clothes you know, we were there for a year. </sentence><sentence id="139">We had all our belongings there clothes and books and everything. </sentence><sentence id="140">They said no, no, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="141">Get out, out of the thing. </sentence><sentence id="142">So here we stood outside and uh the uh direct... director and the teachers wanted us to go <span class="building">home</span> but there was no money, so they took us back to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and we stayed at the uh at the uh, uh <span class="building">station</span> till they got the money together. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were maybe fifty, sixty girls from that <span class="building">school</span> to send and get the railroad tickets to send everybody <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">So by the time I got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was already afternoon and I was the only one from <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> at this time so I was all alone on that <span class="spatial object">train</span> and really heard, heard only fragments of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I had to stay over and change <span class="spatial object">trains</span> on a little <span class="populated place">town</span> so I got there about ten at night and I was afraid to stay alone on the in the <span class="building">station</span> so I went to the nearest <span class="building">hotel</span> and got myself a <span class="interior space">room</span> and told them at five o'clock they should wake me up and bring me here back and went back to the <span class="building">station</span> and back on that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And here comes a whole bunch of SS people and sit in the same <span class="interior space">compartment</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="147">And start talking and telling the stories about the Kristallnacht how they were, uh how they smashed all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and how the <span class="building">synagogues</span> were burning and how many people they arrested and beat up and so uh I got more and more scared. </sentence><sentence id="148">What will I find at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="149">Will I find my parents? </sentence><sentence id="150">Will I find, how will I ... so I got to this, to <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> about two in the afternoon and uh uh the <span class="building">station</span> was right in the middle of <span class="populated place">town</span> so I took the <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span> and I saw already all the <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>, all the <span class="building">stores</span> the glass was on the ___ and here we passed by the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">The <span class="building">synagogue</span> was still not burning but smoldering and I saw what happened. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">Nobody was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">So, but after a while my mother came and told me that they were arresting all the men so my father had been hiding at his mother's <span class="building">house</span> because there was no men in that <span class="building">house</span> and my grandfather too was not arrested, but uh most Jewish men were arrested that night and many in smaller <span class="populated place">towns</span> were beat up but I, I stayed <span class="building">home</span> then for the winter and we knew then and there that the time has come to leave. </sentence><sentence id="155">Before that time, if I may go back, I was fifteen like I say, fourteen, fifteen, and I wasn't so emerged in in daily living or making a living and I always knew that we're going to have a terrible end in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">I couldn't figure out, you know, that they're going to burn us and kill us but I always had the feeling that they had in mind to to to have us die somehow. </sentence><sentence id="157">I always thought they're not going to give us any food coupons anymore and they're going to starve us to death and I begged my parents, let's get out, let's get out, and my father had a very good boss and he unfortunately loved him and said as long as you're with us we're going to keep you and you're going to make a living and he he put in a non Jew into the <span class="building">office</span> and did all kinds of things to keep him there and uh that of course was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="158">So by the time they realized that time was up for us it was already pretty late and no other <span class="country">country</span> took in Jews. </sentence><sentence id="159">The only possibility at this time  was to go to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and uh my parents didn't want to go to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">So they managed, we had a cousin in <span class="country">Cuba</span> and after many weeks of communications, we, she sent us a so called visa to go to <span class="country">Cuba</span> and my parents purchased us seat (ph) uh the the <span class="interior space">cabin space</span> on the <span class="populated place">Havana</span> (ph) <span class="dlf">American line</span>, on the St. Louis, and we were supposed to leave on I think was the 13th of May. </sentence><sentence id="161">Now to be on the <span class="region">personal side</span>, on the 24th of April I had my sixteenth birthday. </sentence><sentence id="162">And my parents thought well you know, I had such terrible youth, at least she wants to make me a little party and I had a friend and he said uh can I bring another friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="163">And my mother said yes, and I had some very good girl friends that uh my parents are friends with their parents from way back from World War | already, and so we had a little party, and he brought this boy. </sentence><sentence id="164">And he had come from so and that's how I met him. </sentence><sentence id="165">That was my future husband. ( </sentence><sentence id="166">PAUSE) So a couple of days later these friends, these, they were two sisters and their parents left for <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">And uh this young man Marcos (ph) said we'll go together to the <span class="building">station</span> to say goodbye to them, and I met him again and he gave me, had given me a book so I went up and I met his mother. </sentence><sentence id="168">I went up to his <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and I went and met his mother for the only time. </sentence><sentence id="169">And he told me that uh he wants to leave but his parents are quite old already and his father got quite beaten in this smaller <span class="populated place">town</span> in during the Kristallnacht and he won't be able to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="170">So his mother wrote, he was also an only child, his mother will bring him to to the <span class="dlf">Belgian border</span> and he will try to go illegally over the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">He has a, he had a girlfriend that he met the year before in in some <span class="populated place">camp</span> and uh her parents have written that they will be willing to take him as a <span class="dlf">border</span> and he should come to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">They are in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> already and he is going to try to go there illegally. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="174">I was going to <span class="country">Cuba</span> and he was going to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, and we were never going to see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="175">So we went uh... a week later or so we said goodbye to my grandparents and uh I must say that to this day that affects me terribly to think back at how we said goodbye to those old people. </sentence><sentence id="176">You know, today I'm as old at this time, they were really old when you were sixty five or sixty you know, and my grandmother was a tiny little woman and she was not well and they just couldn't ... my parents thought we can send for them later on. </sentence><sentence id="177">Otherwise they probably wouldn't have left them. </sentence><sentence id="178">But there was no way at that time to take them along so we had to say goodbye to them and that was a terrible terrible moment. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my other grandmother also. </sentence><sentence id="180">So uh we went to the, to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Just before you get to... slow down a little. </sentence><sentence id="230">We have time. </sentence><sentence id="231">Tell us about your your grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="232">Uh they stayed behind? </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="296">OK) Uh we knew that uh the <span class="dlf">shipping line</span> had uh asked for return tickets and uh it should have told us something but maybe my parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="297">I never thought about that. </sentence><sentence id="298">As a matter of fact when we uh came into <span class="populated place">Havana</span> there was a big rush at the uh <span class="building">telegraph office</span> on the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that uh everybody was you know, the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> money, it was German money that would have been useless afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="299">They wanted to send telegrams send telegrams back <span class="building">home</span> we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="300">But my mother also sent a telegram to her parents arrived safely in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">You know, and they didn't know much about this either. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Well, if you can imagine there was a terrible mood. </sentence><sentence id="397">Everybody was very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="398">Few people committed, tried to commit suicide as I think uh the one man he, I think he cut his wrists and they, he was the only one landed because they had to take him to the <span class="building">hospital</span> to to tend to him. </sentence><sentence id="399">I don't know whether he stayed or not. </sentence><sentence id="400">I think he did. </sentence><sentence id="401">He must have been the only one who stayed. </sentence><sentence id="402">But you know, humans are always hopeful. </sentence><sentence id="403">You know, we always cling to the hope something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="404">They're not going to let us rot on the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">I mean, something had to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="406">Of course, the fear was that we would go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="407">That was the big thing you know. </sentence><sentence id="408">So we the food got worse and worse and the what ever water supply, I mean we had water but we had to be careful and of course the parties were over. </sentence><sentence id="409">No more parties, no more no more fun. </sentence><sentence id="410">We were just sitting and waiting what's going to happen you know and uh here again the Committee tried everything and sent telegrams all over the world trying to get us in but was everyday they had like newsletters printed and put out on <span class="spatial object">board</span> to tell us what's happening and everyday there was another <span class="country">country</span> we were supposed to be going to go, but we never and nothing came about until finally at the we were already well, first we came to the coast of <span class="populated place">Miami</span> and we thought we could you know I heard later that the captain had agreed that we make some kind of a forced landing or something but we didn't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="411">We just saw the uh <span class="spatial object">Coast Guard boats</span> surround us near <span class="populated place">Miami</span> to make sure that we wouldn't even come close to the <span class="dlf">boarder</span>, to <span class="dlf">shore</span>, so that was out. </sentence><sentence id="412">So we saw the lights of <span class="populated place">Miami</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">We saw the lights of <span class="country">America</span> and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="414">So we slowly sailed back to Europe and of course behind the you know there were a lot of negotiations going on with United, the United Jewish Appeal and there was a Mr. Tupper in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and he finally got it together that we will be divided between <span class="country">Belgium</span> and <span class="country">Holland</span> and <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">And uh I don't remember very well I was up on <span class="interior space">deck</span> not near my parents. </sentence><sentence id="416">You know when you're sixteen you don't cling to your parents and so uh when the loudspeaker came on and they announced that the first uh contingent of people will debark in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> uh you know we were out already in the <span class="env feature">water</span> before <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="417">And they announced the names you know that was also the work of the Committee they made  the list, the passenger list and they divided the passengers to wherever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="418">Of course <span class="country">England</span> was already then the preferred <span class="country">country</span> because we knew it was away from Europe you know a little bit and that we had a feeling that would have been the safest, but not everybody could go to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">But my friend, this friend went to <span class="country">England</span> and I never heard from him again. </sentence><sentence id="420">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="421">But we went uh to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="422">Maybe my mother told them that she had a brother there. </sentence><sentence id="423">I don't know how we came to <span class="country">Belgium</span>, but I ran back to the <span class="interior space">cabin</span> and my parents were already packing again and uh we debarked in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">We got off, one of the first ones and then the Paris Match came, the uh newspaper people came and took pictures. </sentence><sentence id="425">Do you want me to show you? ( </sentence><sentence id="426">Sure) And uh we were all standing up on, on <span class="interior space">deck</span> and waiting a man saved his dog, he had to have his dog, and my parents happened to be here they're here. </sentence><sentence id="427">This is my mother and my father. </sentence><sentence id="428">They were standing there, but I was not there. </sentence><sentence id="429">I had been running around. </sentence><sentence id="430">So this was in the Paris Match, and uh you know, was a big story, newspaper story at the time in Europe that this first <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and the people coming. </sentence><sentence id="431">So they put us on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> right away to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and we stayed a couple of nights in a <span class="building">hotel</span> and we were free. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: You had papers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: Well, they made us sign papers that we were not to work and that we were accepted as refugees but that as soon as the situation will allow us to leave the <span class="country">country</span>, we will leave, we will leave. </sentence><sentence id="471">And we signed to that my parents, we signed to that. </sentence><sentence id="472">And forgot all about it but when the war was over, you know, we had to uh report every six months to the police and they presented us with this signature and with this promise. </sentence><sentence id="473">They hadn't forgotten it. </sentence><sentence id="474">It was just filed away through the war and uh that was one reason why we left again. </sentence><sentence id="475">They didn't pressure us actually but every six months we were presented with this again. ( </sentence><sentence id="476">Oh, I see.) </sentence><sentence id="477">After the war. ( </sentence><sentence id="478">After the war.) </sentence><sentence id="479">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="480">But we had signed that, we signed anything we didn't even read we were so glad that we were on uh <span class="env feature">soil</span> and that we were not in <span class="country">Germany</span> and that somebody was going to take care of us more or less. </sentence><sentence id="481">So here we were in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and after, to go back to my private story again, I we walked down the <span class="dlf">boulevard</span> and I stayed and I looked in the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and I come and there's the young man and he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="482">And I came <span class="building">home</span> to mother and I said, you know, I think I saw Marcos, this young man that came to my birthday party. </sentence><sentence id="483">And he went <span class="building">home</span> and there was somebody sitting there and he said if I didn't know that Gerta went to <span class="country">Cuba</span> I would think I saw her today. </sentence><sentence id="484">And this man says, to <span class="country">Cuba</span>? </sentence><sentence id="485">What <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was she on? </sentence><sentence id="486">And he said, I think it was the <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="487">So he said yes, you saw her today. </sentence><sentence id="488">I was, I just come off the <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span> and there was a Gerta Blachman and that was your friend girl, so we met again, and but he had this other girlfriend and but we were good friends and we saw each other off and on. </sentence><sentence id="489">And it was really a big coincidence that we got together again. </sentence><sentence id="490">So we stayed in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and then uh by the time, by this time it was June. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="512">Q: What were you doing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: Well, we had a very limited budget from the <span class="building">United Jewish Appeal</span> to say the least. </sentence><sentence id="514">And my parents, all we could afford they brought us, this lady brought us to find so called <span class="interior space">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">Well, we were, we had then one big <span class="interior space">room</span> and a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> that was used by the people on this <span class="interior space">floor</span> and the people on the other <span class="interior space">floor</span> and it was not a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> either. </sentence><sentence id="516">It was just a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and a <span class="spatial object">sink</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">And we had to have the <span class="env feature">water</span> from there. </sentence><sentence id="518">There was no running water in this so-called <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="519">So my parents let in this one woman on this <span class="spatial object">couch</span> that had to be made up every night and I slept on a <span class="spatial object">cot</span>, the <span class="spatial object">cot</span> in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, so my mother was very anxious for me to get out of this environment and even though we were not supposed to work, she found me a little job as a children's maid in a very nice high rise <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where I had my own <span class="interior space">room</span> and had normal conditions. </sentence><sentence id="520">And I had charge of a little boy that was four years old, three or four years old. </sentence><sentence id="521">And it was away from them but you know, it was better for me. </sentence><sentence id="522">And uh so by uh I was there the whole winter, the whole winter until the 10th of May. </sentence><sentence id="523">I woke up and I heard the noises and there were bombs coming. </sentence><sentence id="524">And I was way up in the you know, in the little <span class="interior space">room</span> on the top of the tilted <span class="dlf">roof</span> so I was pretty high up and I heard the I heard the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="525">I went back to my, to the people in this <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and I said what's happening, what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="526">The Germans attacked <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="527">So the husband was also German-born. </sentence><sentence id="528">They were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="529">She came from <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> but he was also German- born. </sentence><sentence id="530">But they, you know we were just there a few months and we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="531">We didn't know much what was going on but he knew somebody told him maybe from the police or something that they're going to arrest all the German men. </sentence><sentence id="532">The German Jews or non-Jews but because of the first column of spies. </sentence><sentence id="533">They were afraid of spies so they had orders to arrest all German men and he went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="534">He said he's sick. </sentence><sentence id="535">And he said go and call your parents and tell your father to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="536">And I don't remember anymore that they didn't have a <span class="spatial object">phone</span> I just see myself running through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> to a for a <span class="building">drugstore</span> for a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> which was quite far and calling my parents and telling them the same, to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="537">And they wouldn't believe me. </sentence><sentence id="538">They said ah stories are . .. </sentence><sentence id="539">you know. </sentence><sentence id="540">We weren't use to doing things like that. </sentence><sentence id="541">Everything had to be on the up and up. </sentence><sentence id="542">So he didn't do it and two days later they made arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="543">They got into a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> and they sent me <span class="building">home</span> and... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="544">Q: Who got...who they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: This this couple with the little boy. ( </sentence><sentence id="547">OK) You know she came from <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> and they went to <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, or they went away. </sentence><sentence id="548">I mean they saved themselves. </sentence><sentence id="549">I saw them again after the war. </sentence><sentence id="550">They passed, they spent the war in <span class="populated place">ville</span>. </sentence><sentence id="551">I don't know exactly how they got there but they left everything standing there and they got into a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">I think they had their own <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">And they said we can't take you. </sentence><sentence id="554">You go <span class="building">home</span> to your parents. </sentence><sentence id="555">So I see, I remembered going <span class="building">home</span> I think even by <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> because I think by that time the <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span> weren't even running anymore. </sentence><sentence id="556">And I come <span class="building">home</span> and my mother is there and they had already taken my father. </sentence><sentence id="557">So I never saw my father anymore. </sentence><sentence id="558">They had taken him in the uh to the to you know, where the soldiers live. ( </sentence><sentence id="559">A <span class="building">garrison</span>?) </sentence><sentence id="560">A <span class="building">garrison</span>, yes, and they had all these people, all these men assembled there and my friend Marcos had been just sixteen so sixteen was the cutoff age and he was on the <span class="dlf">street</span> just  0 walking. </sentence><sentence id="561">He didn't have a toothbrush. </sentence><sentence id="562">He didn't have a shirt. </sentence><sentence id="563">He didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="564">They took him off the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">My father they let pack at least a little, you know. </sentence><sentence id="566">They took him off the <span class="dlf">street</span> and he was with my father and all the other Germans in the <span class="building">garrison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">Anduh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: How did you and your mother handle that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Well, we tried, you know we packed up things and we packed up things and we took it there. </sentence><sentence id="593">We couldn't get in and then they said, the next day they said they going to be transported to south of <span class="country">France</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> leaves on so and so, so we went early in the morning and we saw them marching through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="594">We saw them going to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="595">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="596">So I really wanted they said they're going to take them to south of <span class="country">France</span> away from the war. </sentence><sentence id="597">Well the war accelerated but communication was so bad we didn't know in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> that they had attacked <span class="dlf">line</span> and they to take <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">We just thought they just had taked <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">You know, there was no <span class="spatial object">television</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">There was hardly any newspaper at that time and our French wasn't that great. </sentence><sentence id="601">We didn't read the <span class="spatial object">newspaper</span> every day. </sentence><sentence id="602">And we didn't know anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: You didn't have a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: Yeah, but I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="617">I, maybe they didn't uh communicate that I'm pretty sure we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="618">So I persuaded my mother we'll go with you know. </sentence><sentence id="619">Go away. </sentence><sentence id="620">We'll go, try to go to <span class="country">France</span> or try to find my father. </sentence><sentence id="621">So we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">This is usually; it takes today a half hour. </sentence><sentence id="623">At that time it took maybe three quarters of an hour. </sentence><sentence id="624">There were already really good <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">It took all day and we got to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> it was dark and it was full of glass from the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="626">It was worse there than in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">And uh, but there were we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="628">There were thousands of refugees you know so they herded us to a <span class="building">convent</span> into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and we spent the night there. </sentence><sentence id="629">They gave us <span class="building">shelter</span> and uh they gave us breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="630">And it was a terrible night that we'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="631">You know, the <span class="spatial object">bombs</span> were flying and uh we were there down in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and uh with hundreds of other people. </sentence><sentence id="632">So in the morning we got up on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and here again everything was covered with glass and the only way to go to the <span class="dlf">French border</span> was the <span class="spatial object">tramway</span>, the <span class="spatial object">tramway</span> that went all the way the co... all along the <span class="env feature">coast</span> from <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> I don't remember any more the last <span class="building">station</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, uh, all little <span class="populated place">resort places</span> that all along the <span class="env feature">coast</span> and that <span class="spatial object">tramway</span> used to you know connect these little places. </sentence><sentence id="633">So we went to the end of the <span class="dlf">line</span> till we found a young boy there that had lost his from this Mrs. Matulski (ph) that was with us from the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and one of the three children she had gone the same <span class="dlf">route</span> without us knowing it and she was there in the morning waiting for the <span class="spatial object">tramway</span> and she was a very nervous person, boom boom, she was on the <span class="spatial object">tram</span> with the girl and the boy was a little slower and he was standing there, and so we took him along and we eventually found the mother and the other girl and so we stayed together on this trip, on this what we called the and again something personal. </sentence><sentence id="634">When we got out of this <span class="dlf">tramway</span> even though I was on the <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span> and we were four weeks on this, on the <span class="env feature">water</span>, I had never been on the uh on the shore of the of  1 the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>. </sentence><sentence id="635">You know, never seen the <span class="env feature">beach</span> like that on the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> and it was in evening and I really remember that that was such an incredible sight, and you know, the peacefulness and in the midst of all this uh turmoil and war and running and then there was the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>, untouched and <span class="env feature">beach</span> and the sunset and this is something I have never forgotten in all these years. </sentence><sentence id="636">So we tried. </sentence><sentence id="637">We found a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="638">I was almost a woman. </sentence><sentence id="639">I was you know and the two ladies and the two children and uh they said the <span class="dlf">French border</span> is closed. </sentence><sentence id="640">No body can go across the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="641">But we couldn't go back either. </sentence><sentence id="642">We couldn't go back and we couldn't go forward, so we stayed in this little <span class="interior space">hotel room</span> and waited. </sentence><sentence id="643">Then one day they said, tomorrow they're going to open the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="644">You can go. </sentence><sentence id="645">So from there to the <span class="dlf">border</span> was still a ways to walk, but we walked. </sentence><sentence id="646">That was the only, the only way to go. </sentence><sentence id="647">There was no transportation and there were no <span class="spatial object">buses</span> or anything so if you can picture this, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people walking to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and they thought across the <span class="dlf">border</span> will be safe. </sentence><sentence id="648">It's <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">So here comes the famous story of my mother's silver fox. </sentence><sentence id="650">We come to the, to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and you know, we didn't have much <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="651">We didn't have anything, you know, but she wanted the silver fox and she had it like just a stole like so when we came to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we showed our German papers, he said, oh no, you can't go through here with German papers. </sentence><sentence id="652">You go back. </sentence><sentence id="653">You can't, we won't let you in. </sentence><sentence id="654">So as the and then the people were pushing from the back and there was a young boy with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and somehow that wonderful silver fox got tangled up in the uh in the wheels of that <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="657">The silver fox, and we were all holding hands, and all five of us ran through with the silver fox. </sentence><sentence id="658">Well it wasn't such a wonderful thing you know. </sentence><sentence id="659">It wasn't any different over there than in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="660">It was exactly the same. </sentence><sentence

only time I was really really afraid because they they uh machine gunned all the refugees right on this <span class="dlf">highway</span> and I pulled my mother and said, let's go, and there was a <span class="building">farm house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">We didn't even ask can we come in. </sentence><sentence id="668">We just went in. </sentence><sentence id="669">And we, all

</sentence><sentence id="670">Now we weren't too thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="671">But we couldn't stay in that <span class="building">house</span> because they didn't have <span class="interior

class="building">castle</span> like, you know, not a <span class="building">castle</span>, <span class="building">castle</span>, but a <span class="building">castle</span> and we went in there and there was an old lady and she was also , she said yeah, yeah, I speak a little Flemish and I speak a little German and I speak a little French, and she said, yeah, you can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="672">And uh we stayed maybe one night or  2 maybe not even a night when the Germans came there too. </sentence><sentence id="673">And they wanted to make the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="888">Q: What was in the <span class="spatial object">box</span>? </sentence><sentence id="889">What did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="892">A: There was a very ingenious way of packing. </sentence><sentence id="893">They had made to order <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> like like uh <span class="interior space">closets</span> and you know, on the one side were some clothes and then there were <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> on the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span> and then, they were sometimes as big as a small <span class="interior space">room</span> but it was all one great box. </sentence><sentence id="894">So I don't remember any more exactly but I think my mother had uh uh <span class="spatial object">table</span> service that she was able, that we were able to sell and some crystal. </sentence><sentence id="895">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="896">No silver. </sentence><sentence id="897">No gold. </sentence><sentence id="898">That had to be brought to Hitler you know we had to, they allowed us two uh <span class="spatial object">table</span> settings silver a person, one for milk and one for supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="899">And uh, but everything else including jewelry and silver had to be uh brought you know, give them away, but she had the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, so she had beautiful linens. </sentence><sentence id="900">She had uh crystal and things like that that we sold. </sentence><sentence id="901">Little by little we sold it and she made a little bit of money and I must have made some money there too. </sentence><sentence id="902">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="903">Anyhow, we lived. </sentence><sentence id="904">We had a little <span class="interior space">apartment</span> then in uh in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and on the other side =. </sentence><sentence id="905">Then she made friends with uh Jewish people who had lived there for a long time and they helped us and we got along. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="920">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="921">Tell me about your, the papers that you had at this time. </sentence><sentence id="922">They were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: At this time we still had our regular papers. ( </sentence><sentence id="927">OK) And nobody really bothered us because the Germans, you know, that was the beginning of the Germans but, and the and the occupation and the Belgiums were kind of in the background but we got food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="928">I mean not for free but for rationing. </sentence><sentence id="929">That we got. </sentence><sentence id="930">I don't, I guess with our regular papers. </sentence><sentence id="931">I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="938">Q: You brought a Juda, the <span class="env feature">star</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">Were you wearing that later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="942">A: In a minute. </sentence><sentence id="943">So in 1942 then they, the Germans started to tighten the screws about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="944">First they said curfew. </sentence><sentence id="945">You had to be <span class="building">home</span> by eight o'clock at night when, you know. </sentence><sentence id="946">And then they started yes to, all the Jews had to wear this star out on their on their outer garments when we were out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="947">And a lot of <span class="country">Belgium</span> people put it on too in solidarity to us. </sentence><sentence id="948">In <span class="country">Sweden</span>, the King of <span class="country">Sweden</span> wore it. </sentence><sentence id="949">A lot of people wore this to be, you know, in, to show solidarity with us. </sentence><sentence id="950">But we were still free. </sentence><sentence id="951">We could still go around with this or without it, not without it, you know, but this is, we could go. </sentence><sentence id="952">Till one day there was a proclamation, all Jews have to go the uh uh <span class="building">City Hall</span>, <span class="building">City Hall</span> and register. </sentence><sentence id="953">Just register. </sentence><sentence id="954">So my mother said, we are not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="955">If they don't know  6 about us, they you know, that _ I'm not going to register. </sentence><sentence id="956">And this other lady, this Mrs. Matulski, said no, we have we have to, they're going to send us to work you know. </sentence><sentence id="957">We cannot do against it. </sentence><sentence id="958">Too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="959">And she did register, but we never did. </sentence><sentence id="960">So time wore on and it got a little bit worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="961">All of a sudden it started with people catching people on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> or deportations. </sentence><sentence id="962">And they, on the <span class="dlf">street</span> they took anybody that had this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="963">They went on <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="964">They went in the front and in the back of <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span>, the SS, and nobody could escape and they went through all the people and we had, we had identification papers, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="965">But from the lists that been registered they went from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> and you know, they had the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="966">They had the people. </sentence><sentence id="967">It was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="968">They went and picked them up. </sentence><sentence id="969">So they sent them letters that they have to report, and it said for work only for labor. </sentence><sentence id="970">But my mother got around and they started to get rumors to rumors already that specially girls that they put girls in <span class="building">whore houses</span>, that they used the Jewish girls for the soldiers and that's all she had to hear. </sentence><sentence id="971">So she wasn't going to let us down. </sentence><sentence id="972">We weren't going to go to any forced labor and we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="973">But then one day this lady got the letter. </sentence><sentence id="974">She has to report then and then for labor. </sentence><sentence id="975">It always said for labor. </sentence><sentence id="976">So uh she came, the boy came running to us. </sentence><sentence id="977">Mrs.Blochman, my mother wants go to <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and please help us. </sentence><sentence id="978">I don't want to go and so my mother went over there and she said start packing. </sentence><sentence id="979">They lived with a family that had a <span class="building">grocery store</span> downstairs and she had sent the girl away in the <span class="country">country</span> with, to the family of these people they became pretty well friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="980">And you and will go away like here is punctual and you can go under false names and you go there. </sentence><sentence id="981">Nobody knows you there and we will see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="982">Nobody ever sent us a letter but they came closer and closer and they had these deportations so mother made arrangements we should hide like Ann Frank, you know, like in the <span class="building">house</span> only we didn't have that much money and it was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="983">People didn't do it just for the love only. </sentence><sentence id="984">You know, they, they wanted to be paid and they wanted to be paid for the food at least and for the <span class="interior space">room</span> so mother and I we went, one night somebody said there's going to be a, said it's going to be uh some you know people going to be picked up tonight so we went into this <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">We spent one night there. </sentence><sentence id="986">And I said mother, that's not right. </sentence><sentence id="987">We're going to go crazy. </sentence><sentence id="988">We can't stay here the two of us until the end of the war you know, alone and we don't have enough money to pay her so we came out of hiding the next day. </sentence><sentence id="989">And we had friends and he said, he got us into connection with the <span class="interior space">French underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="990">There were already the <span class="interior space">French underground</span> and there were some uh English uh prisoners of wars that had escaped from <span class="country">Germany</span> and there was an <span class="dlf">underground route</span> to bring them to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and from <span class="country">Switzerland</span> to <span class="country">Portugal</span> and back to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="991">And somehow they got us into connect...into contact with this group and we were the first women that went. </sentence><sentence id="992">Mother and I first. </sentence><sentence id="993">Not this lady. </sentence><sentence id="994">She was still in the and her little girl was in the <span class="country">country</span> and everything was so far so good. </sentence><sentence id="995">So, but we didn't have that much money anymore. </sentence><sentence id="996">You know, when they only took you to the <span class="dlf">French border</span> you know and then you had to have some money so we got together with another, with a Belgium lady or at least a lady who had lived there, had a business there for a long time, and she had also three children "a little girl was the smallest, was only two years old or three years old. </sentence><sentence id="997">And they said if you help me she said with the children on this trip I'll pay your expenses. </sentence><sentence id="998">So one Sunday, uh  7 the meantime in <span class="country">France</span> had started the deportations already. </sentence><sentence id="999">And the people like my father and, they were in this <span class="populated place">French camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1000">had come and the south of <span class="country">France</span> wasn't free anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Was also German. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So they got all the non-Jewish Germans out of this <span class="populated place">camp</span> and took the Jews to <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1003"><span class="populated place">Drancy</span> was this <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> from where the French Jews were sent to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1004">It's a... so we wanted to go on a Sunday and on Thursday morning we get a card, a postcard from my father from <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1005">So we knew, and my mother was very upset and she said, you do what you want. </sentence><sentence id="1006">If you want to go, I'll go but she was out of her you know. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So we left everything standing there like we lived you know and our whole <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, we had everything threes between. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Three blouses and three bras and three this, so we could change. </sentence><sentence id="1009">One changed and the next day somebody, the other one changed. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And we only had little uh like an <span class="spatial object">attache case</span>, that was all our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> because they told us not to take anything. </sentence><sentence id="1011">But we had some dollar bills. </sentence><sentence id="1012">My mother had some dollars I mean, at that time maybe two hundred or three hundred dollars which was a lot of money then, and that was the most dangerous if, you know, if they found this on you that was immediate death. </sentence><sentence id="1013">But this other money wasn't worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="1014">So this French, that friend, said don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1015">We'll do something so he took a whole loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1016">Everybody stuck it in their shoes and that where the first place the Germans were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1017">But he was smart. </sentence><sentence id="1018">He took a piece, a whole loaf of bread and he sliced it very fine and two slices, he put the dollar bill in and he sewed the two slices of bread together you know, so you couldn't tell no way, unless you really pulled it away, so we had this bread. </sentence><sentence id="1019">You know, like we wanted to have something to eat on the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1020">And he gave us, there's where we got the false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1021">From this underground uh from this <span class="building">underground organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">With different names and we rehearsed the names over and over and we were supposed to been born in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> or in so to explain our German accent, that we didn't speak perfect French. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And we got on this on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and uh with this other lady with the three children, and we we somehow got through. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I mean there was a control on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, on the <span class="dlf">French border</span>, and we, we showed our papers and he accepted that. </sentence><sentence id="1025">That was we got through that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="building">border patrol</span> and SS on the on the <span class="dlf">exit</span> and they looked everybody over and you know,  8 they, but we got through that. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So we got the little <span class="interior space">hotel room</span> and we stayed overnight and then when they, I think next morning, we went for breakfast into like a <span class="building">cafe</span>, you know, this little <span class="populated place">French town</span>, and we were all sitting around and here comes, in a round, ina round <span class="spatial object">table</span> with the children, and here comes the <span class="spatial object">SS</span>, comes in and looks because we weren't the only ones. </sentence><sentence id="1130">I mean that the way to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and we weren't the only ones going to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And they were trying uh to catch as many as possible but they didn't want to make uh very big thing out of it so they just went, came into the <span class="building">cafe</span> and looked and looked and our hearts stood still. </sentence><sentence id="1132">It was like you know, like you're frozen in time. </sentence><sentence id="1133">You know, we don't and then he looked at each other and he said no, I don't think there are any here. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And they left you know. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And you die a little bit at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So that was really the closest we came with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And then this young man told us uh we're coming very close to the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span> now and they are even more vigilant and more uh you know, so he won't go. </sentence><sentence id="1138">He doesn't want to jeopardize the this <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1139">You know, they don't want him to, and we are on our own now. </sentence><sentence id="1140">But we should look in this <span class="populated place">village</span> there on the French uh <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>, we should look around and ask for a guy named Gerard (ph) and Gerard will take us over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">He knows we are coming and he will take us over. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Well, we got off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> didn't go to this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1143">We got off before and we were afraid to go all on the same <span class="spatial object">bus</span> so we sent this lady with the smaller children on the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and mother and I were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And we were walking on the <span class="dlf">highway</span> with our little <span class="spatial object">attache case</span> and two women it looked kind of in in city clothes after all, and we looked a little bit conspicuous I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So the French gendarme stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And he really questioned us. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Questioned our papers and he heard as a Frenchman more than the Germans that our French wasn't up to par and we said well, we are from and we always spoke German but well, it was a long story and but finally my mother said, look, uh you hate the Germans don't you. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And he said yes, I hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1149">I said more than you hate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So, she said, what do you want from us. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Let us take our chances. </sentence><sentence id="1153">You know, she didn't tell we're Jews, we're not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1154">So he says OK. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I'll, he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="1156">So we went to this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1157">We came to this <span class="populated place">village</span> and we couldn't locate Gerard. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And wherever we asked for Gerard they just froze. </sentence><sentence id="1159">The people froze up. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So we stayed one night and there was a lot of German soldiers in this <span class="populated place">village</span> and we were very scared. </sentence><sentence id="1161">So we said, well, we have to get out of here because here they will catch us. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So here we started walking again, and we walked up the <span class="dlf">highway</span> and we came up to a little <span class="building">country inn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1163">So we got in there and we asked for two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> for the two families and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And I think that people knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="1165">You know in German we have a saying when you die and you don't leave any money for the funeral, he says we're going to smell him out. </sentence><sentence id="1166">You know, it's going to smell. </sentence><sentence id="1167">They're going to have to bury us with a . </sentence><sentence id="1168">So we're going to sit here until we smell, till they do something with us. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="1170">They they got together and they called the uh, without us talking about it, they knew exactly what what we wanted you know. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Was very close, within walking distance of the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1172">So uh, so they got the the priest and the priest talked it over with some people in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and they talked it over. </sentence><sentence id="1173">There came the <span class="spatial object">letter carrier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1174">The <span class="spatial object">letter carrier</span> was going on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, was always going on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So they said to us, I mean we paid. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I mean the lady had . </sentence><sentence id="1177">We paid her for what nights we stayed and you know, and uh they sent a <span class="spatial object">hay wagon</span> with clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1178"> 9 They gave us uh old aprons like this farm women are wearing and they hid, they put us on the <span class="spatial object">hay wagon</span> and the, the children, they were hiding in the hay and they gave us milk cans. </sentence><sentence id="1179">You know there were milk canson _ like we were farmers" women that were going on the, coming <span class="building">home</span> from uh milking cows or something. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And they hiding our little bit of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> under the hay and they took us back; the <span class="dlf">highway</span> that was the way was back to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Oh, I forgot to tell, I went back one day with this young man, with this with this boy, to the <span class="populated place">village</span> to ask again for Gerard, and I found out that he had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1182">That's why everybody was so afraid to even mention his name. </sentence><sentence id="1183">So we went back, they had to go back to this <span class="populated place">village</span> in order to get to the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And the letter carrier, they went around the dinner hour when the <span class="building">German border patrol</span> was having dinner and they knew exactly by observation what time, but still, to make sure, the letter carrier on his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> went right in front of us, ahead of us to make sure that we don't run into any patrols or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1185">So he went ahead and we came on that <span class="spatial object">hay wagon</span> and they brought us to the <span class="dlf">farm</span> right on the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we got out and we got, each got a glass of milk yet and that was the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was like a hundred years ago and | can still see it and they said well, that's as far as we can go. </sentence><sentence id="1186">You go down here in the back of us is like a <span class="env feature">ravine</span> and there's a little <span class="env feature">brook</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1187">We go over the <span class="env feature">brook</span> but there is <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">You have to go through this <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> or over or under or whatever, and on the other side is <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Good luck. </sentence><sentence id="1190">So that little girl had a pacifier and we, we went down this <span class="env feature">ravine</span> and we went over the <span class="env feature">brook</span> and we went up the other side and that little girl lost her pacifier and started screaming bloody murder, but we still made it and we came over the <span class="dlf">border</span> and uh but the Swiss border guard had heard her all the way across and he came and he helped us and you know, and we were kind of happy, but my mother said let's go, let's go little bit further in. </sentence><sentence id="1191">They can still send us back, and you know, we'll celebrate later. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So we got but he was good. </sentence><sentence id="1193">In the meantime in the beginning of the deportations, the Swiss didn't let anybody in. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And they turned back a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="1195">But in the meantime, we came a little bit later already, the public opinion had forced them to take them in, especially women and children and we had no man with us, so he wasn't going to turn us back anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1196">So he took us, I don't think to another <span class="building">hotel</span> by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1197">He took us to a little, to, to a <span class="populated place">town</span> where there was a bigger uh <span class="building">police headquarters</span> and uh we stayed overnight and we had he stayed with us and he even watched us when we went to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1198">He stood in front of the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I mean he didn't let us get out of sight and uh my mother said by the way, we're not free. </sentence><sentence id="1200">They watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1201">They treat us nicely but we're not going to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1202">So we tried to call our relatives in <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> but we couldn't uh commu.., there was no communication. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I don't remember any more. </sentence><sentence id="1204">We couldn't tell them that we were in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1205">So uh we told them of course right way that these papers are false, and we gave them our right papers, our right names. </sentence><sentence id="1206">We had no papers to the effect but we gave them our right names and and everything and they were OK. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I mean they fed us and they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And then in the afternoon, there was a bigger group of us. </sentence><sentence id="1209">They put us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and it was a very strange feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1210">You are in a new <span class="country">country</span>, and they do with you what they want. </sentence><sentence id="1211">They put us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> didn't say a word where we're going or what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And uh they marched us through the <span class="populated place">city</span> of and there must have been about ten or twelve of us and uh people were looking out the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1213">They'd say ah, the poor people, the poor people, they're going  0 to the I don't remember anymore but they uh we spoke enough French to know that the <span class="building">prison</span> is a <span class="building">prison</span> is a <span class="building">prison</span>, but it was a different word it was different they said a different word that we didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Well, we understood pretty soon, pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We came to this <span class="building">prison</span> that must have been five hundred years old. </sentence><sentence id="1216">The keys were this big. </sentence><sentence id="1217">They had you know, thick <span class="dlf">walls</span> and thick and they, right away they separated this lady from her family. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They took the son. </sentence><sentence id="1219">He was only ten or twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="1220">They took him to stay with other men and she and her daughter went in one <span class="interior space">room</span> and mother and I were in another in another <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and uh as a matter of fact the first <span class="interior space">cell</span> had only one <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and we didn't know how, so we slept like this, like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1221">We had funny things that happening too you know. </sentence><sentence id="1222">like I said the key was so big and the <span class="dlf">key hole</span> was that big too, so I was laying in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> like this and all of a sudden I said mother, somebody is looking at me, somebody is looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="1223">She said who's going to look. </sentence><sentence id="1224">So anyhow there was a prisoner outside that had it wasn't you know a <span class="building">penitentiary</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1225">It was an old <span class="building">jail</span> where people was kept and all of a sudden I see, there comes a knife with a pad of butter through this <span class="dlf">key hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And this was apparently in __ or something that could order his own food in there and he had wonderful breakfast and he wanted us to have a pad of butter. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Oh, we had all kinds of . . . </sentence><sentence id="1228">then we heard singing. . . </sentence><sentence id="1229">Hebrew songs, Jewish songs, singing. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And there was another group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1231">They wanted us to know that they are there. </sentence><sentence id="1232">You know, they couldn't communicate with us any different way, so we heard this singing and so when the regular prisoners were, they had time out in the morning to make their <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and to empty their <span class="spatial object">sinks</span> (ph) and so you know they kept us in the <span class="interior space">cells</span>, but when they were, when the regular prisoners were in their <span class="interior space">cells</span> during the day, then they kept us, we could go out in the <span class="interior space">hallways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And they were great big <span class="interior space">hallways</span> with and we met with the other refugees and you know, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And we, we got food and we uh the <span class="interior space">basement</span> they had <span class="interior space">bathtubs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1235">We could even take a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And not everyday but you know, they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1237">But the food of course wasn't too great so my mother was always afraid that I was going to starve you know, the regular Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="1238">So one day she said to this, to the , can't I get anything else for my daughter? </sentence><sentence id="1239">And I said, mother, what do you think we are in <span class="building">prison</span> what are you . . . </sentence><sentence id="1240">Sure enough a couple of days later he comes up with a whole <span class="spatial object">tray</span> with a little steak and other things and I almost died because all these, our poor prisoners, got only water and you know the regular food and here I had a steak, but I guess mothers will be mothers even in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1241">So that little by little everybody was transported away and even this lady with the children I think got out earlier than we did. _ </sentence><sentence id="1242">and we were left just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="1243">We had Rosh Hashanan there and they had taken us to another little <span class="populated place">town</span> for, and the women were in the <span class="building">hotel</span> but they didn't have money to put the men in the <span class="building">hotel</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="1244">The men they put in <span class="building">prison</span> there over night but OK. </sentence><sentence id="1245">We were happy then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1373">Q: You got to go to services? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1375">A: We got to go to services and they gave us a very nice meal in the <span class="building">hotel</span>, under surveillance. </sentence><sentence id="1376">They were policemen there, but we met the Jewish people and it was it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Yom Kippur we spent in <span class="building">prison</span> and there were a couple of men who held services in the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1378">We were, like I said, we could visit during the day and they held our  1 food until at night and we got the whole meal at night and it was OK. </sentence><sentence id="1379">But then mother and I we were the only ones left and it got colder already and we didn't have any clothes so there was one family in had a beautiful <span class="building">department store</span>, wealthy Swiss Jews and they always came visiting and see, to see what they can do for the refugees and uh when you know it got colder then uh mother said to them we really don't have any clothes and you know <span class="country">Switzerland</span> is, gets cold pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Oh, they said, there's no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And he asked the prison warden, you know, can these people come to my <span class="building">store</span> and pick out clothes, and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1382">So was a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="1383">They opened the <span class="dlf">gates</span> and mother and I we walked out and we went to the <span class="building">store</span>, and the lady invited us up for tea. </sentence><sentence id="1384">We had beautiful tea in the <span class="building">salon</span> with cake and you know, like real people and he took us around in the <span class="building">store</span>, and he said pick out what you need you know, was for winter and it became a habit. </sentence><sentence id="1385">We went every day we went out walking and five o'clock we went back to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1386">You know, there was no place else to go. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1388">But of course not for very long. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Then I got sick and we got to the <span class="building">Salvation Army</span> and we stayed at <span class="building">the Salvation Army</span> a little bit and then in the meantime this Mrs. Matulski and her two children came the same way we came and she was a very nervous person so she took some sleeping pills and she slept through the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1390">She was, and the boy was already you know children have to grow up pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="1391">He gave the policemen the the patrol their papers and she slept. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So they thought if this lady sleep so well she can't be very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="1393">So they made it too. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And they were already in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> uh like they called <span class="populated place">lager</span> it was the beginning where people got processed. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And she wrote to Mother we are here and it's very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1396">We even have curtains on the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1397">We have and it's not so bad and why don't you try coming here. </sentence><sentence id="1398">So while we were at the <span class="building">Salvation Army</span>, we went to this to the police to the you know, and my mother said we have friends at this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We wouldn't mind going there. </sentence><sentence id="1400">So he said Mrs. Blachman, I don't think you want to go there. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I wouldn't like you to go there, but if you want to we will send you there. </sentence><sentence id="1402">So he gave us a policeman and we you know went to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1403">That <span class="populated place">camp</span> was worse than the <span class="building">prison</span> because the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was <span class="building">barracks</span> and in the meantime it's November and it's raining and it's muddy and they have a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> out on the <span class="interior space">yard</span> and the watchman out in the <span class="interior space">yard</span>, and my mother got a bladder infection and the food was terrible and we had it was like almost. </sentence><sentence id="1404">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And not only that there were a lot of people from <span class="country">France</span> that we for the first time talked to and found out what my father went through and they told us that my father was deported. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Actually that's where we learned it. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And we saw how terrible these people looked already. </sentence><sentence id="1408">You know, we were still fresh from <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1409">We hadn't lost so much weight yet and we looked still like people, but these people looked already like they had been through the <span class="building">mill</span> you know, so so it was very depressing and uh there was nothing to do and we were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1410">We had little curtains on the <span class="dlf">windows</span> but that didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1411">So it became winter and we got, we were divided into different <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and mother and I we went, and this lady too with her daughter, went to uh <span class="populated place">Leistahl</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1412">That's close to . </sentence><sentence id="1413">And in the meantime I think we had communications with our family in <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1414">I think we wrote to them from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and they wrote back so one day, low and behold I get a postcard to Gerta Blachman from <span class="populated place">Marcos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1415"><span class="populated place">Marcos</span> is also in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1416">He had walked. </sentence><sentence id="1417">He had, he was a member of . </sentence><sentence id="1418">Uh not a member a child in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and he was in  2 an <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">France</span> at uh one night they was going to be deported and the policemen came to the director of that____ <span class="building">school</span> and said, send your oldest ones, the ones that you think can make it on their own, out tonight because tomorrow morning the <span class="building">SS</span> is coming to take all the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So he was seventeen, eighteen, in the meantime and the director gave them whatever they could and money or whatever little, and he had made it to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1420">Like over five or six weeks he walked, in <span class="building">hotels</span> and he walked at night and slept in daytime and he spoke beautiful French. </sentence><sentence id="1421">He was very talented with languages. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Spoke a perfect French. </sentence><sentence id="1423">He worked for a time in the <span class="building">French youth group</span> and they had trouble with them and I don't know how he made it to <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> coming from <span class="region">south of France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">He made it in to <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> and in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> he got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1425">He was never caught. </sentence><sentence id="1426">He was never__ and he traveled to <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> to his uncle and he presented he had an uncle or a relative in <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> and he presented himself there. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And uh the uncle said I am very happy but you can't stay with me for the rest of... you have to go to the police and present yourself, you know, tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1428">So they sent him to a different <span class="populated place">camp</span> but not back you know. </sentence><sentence id="1429">So he wrote to my relatives we had given each other the addresses so in case you know there were, and here he is also in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And uh so the next spring by coincidence he got into what called . </sentence><sentence id="1431">That was also nearby but maybe two hours by foot from my <span class="populated place">camp</span> to his <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And uh at that time we weren't allowed to go much yet but he sent, some other young man came and told me about him and maybe we could use <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> or something, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1433">But anyhow we got together and that's really when our courtship started and we walked and walked to get to each other you know. </sentence><sentence id="1434">It was down to and up through the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and there were beautiful <span class="dlf">cherry orchards</span> in the summer and the things were... Each had to walk an hour to meet and then we started walking because there was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1435">I mean we couldn't you know was a very strange courtship but... Sometimes we met in the little <span class="populated place">town</span> in the winter and we sat in the <span class="interior space">tearoom</span> and had uh coffee or tea or called <span class="building">cafe</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1436">Was this bread and jelly and butter and coffee that's very uh Swiss? </sentence><sentence id="1437">So that's where we started our friendship, our courtship when we got so we were in this <span class="populated place">working camp</span> and here I sewed. </sentence><sentence id="1438">I was sewing again. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I, there were also the people sent in, donated clothes and there were also some Viennese who seemed to be the best dressmakers and they asked me, I said yes, I know a little bit and there I learned some more. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And we changed, we altered the clothes, these donated clothes, for the for the people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And uh one day the director of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> received a uh request, you know if there are young girls in there that know how to sew, there's a shortage of operators like operators you know for uh in a <span class="building">blouse factory</span> in <span class="populated place">Bern</span> and they would get the papers on the working permission for such a person. </sentence><sentence id="1442">So she asked me would I go. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And I said yes, sure. </sentence><sentence id="1444">You know, to be free and to learn more in my trade. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So was very upset and very heart broken that I would leave and he wouldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="1446">So the only way for him to be free was to become a <span class="spatial object">dishwasher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1447">That was also in shortage. </sentence><sentence id="1448">So he put in to go to <span class="populated place">Bern</span> to be a <span class="spatial object">dishwasher</span> and my, these people put in for me the papers to be an operator. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Well, the <span class="spatial object">dishwashers</span> were needed more than the operators. </sentence><sentence id="1450">He was there in one week. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And he was washing dishes in <span class="populated place">Bern</span> in a in a <span class="building">restaurant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And he was quite a spoiled young man but when it came you know from at <span class="building">home</span>, he was an only child but when it, something had to be done, he did it. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And he was alone in <span class="populated place">Bern</span> and I was alone there in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="1454">But we  3 stuck it out. </sentence><sentence id="1455">He came back one weekend to see me and then finally my papers came through and I came to <span class="populated place">Bern</span> too and we were together. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I mean he stayed, he had to live there under very bad conditions and very dirty conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1457">You know, but anyhow, this is so many years back. </sentence><sentence id="1458">So we were there together again and uh I learned a lot in this <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1459">That was my first job as a <span class="spatial object">power machine</span>, you know, uh experience on a <span class="spatial object">power machine</span> and uh it was quite a strict thing. </sentence><sentence id="1460">I had to be there very early and I am not an early riser so I had to be there from, they just started to change from uh sixty hour uh from uh from uh six day working day to five days a week and that meant of course more hours every day to put it into five days you know. </sentence><sentence id="1461">They started very early but uh we managed to see each other on weekends. </sentence><sentence id="1462">But he had to work weekends too. </sentence><sentence id="1463">You know, in a <span class="building">restaurant</span> was a different schedule so one day he stuck himself with a fork in the <span class="spatial object">dishpan</span> and he got an infection and couldn't and they sent him to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and he got all bandaged up and he couldn't work so he, his boss said if you can't wash dishes you are no good to me. </sentence><sentence id="1464">You are fired. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So he came to stay with me in the same <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Had a little <span class="interior space">room</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span> and he stayed there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And my landlady was very proper and she got very upset and she sent no less the vice police after him and he got arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1469">I mean he got taken in and they took, brought him to the police where he should have reported that he wasn't working anymore you know. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And he, they said well, what's you know, what's the story and he told them and he said that's my fiancee but we can't get married because we have no papers so he says, oh sure, you can get married. </sentence><sentence id="1471">He says do you have any _. </sentence><sentence id="1472">He said yeah, my mother in law is here, you know, her mother is here and I have a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1473">He said well, if they uh certify that this is your name, you can get married. </sentence><sentence id="1474">So we got married. ( </sentence><sentence id="1475">Laughter) But he never went back to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Neither one of us got back to the uh went back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1477">My mother uh became a housekeeper. </sentence><sentence id="1478">She got commissioned for a housekeeper in <span class="populated place">Bern</span> and after we got married the first of May he uh went to a <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1479">The <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> sent him to a <span class="building">school</span> to a uh <span class="building">business school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And so we worked. </sentence><sentence id="1481">We were there together. </sentence><sentence id="1482">We had one <span class="interior space">room</span> but a bigger <span class="interior space">room</span>, a nicer <span class="interior space">room</span>, and nice people and my uh my boss, my you know, from the <span class="building">blouse factory</span> kind of made the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="1483">They came with us to the uh, it was on the first of May and there was no <span class="spatial object">trolley cars</span> so we running like crazy through whole of <span class="populated place">Zurich</span>, no <span class="populated place">Bern</span>, to the to the uh to get married and my mother was uh brought the flowers. </sentence><sentence id="1484">The lady had given her lilacs. </sentence><sentence id="1485">She came with a armful of lilacs that was my flowers. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And after ceremony my the uh my boss took us out for lunch and then in the afternoon we went to the rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="1487">We had a Jewish ceremony at the rabbi's <span class="building">home</span> and the , the wife of the rabbi had made cookies and wine and it was... Then my mother had made little sandwiches and they all came to our new <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1488">So we had no dishes. </sentence><sentence id="1489">We had nothing and so this lady said what, you have no <span class="spatial object">dishes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1490">No. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So she went to the <span class="building">department store</span> there and sent us our first set of dishes the same day so she wouldn't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1612">Q: Can you pull it. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Let's, you're, you're now married and we need some of the little ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: Well, after the war...  4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: Yeah, bring us to the close of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Tell us what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1622">A: Well, by then the war was almost over. </sentence><sentence id="1623">As a matter of fact on the on the, I have a newspaper uh <span class="populated place">Bern</span>, from <span class="populated place">Bern</span>, where the headline is Hitler is dead, on the thirtieth, I think it was the thirtieth of April, 1945, and then the, and the civil column was of our marriage announcement. </sentence><sentence id="1624">It's in the same paper, and was a big headline you know. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And so uh, well sure there was uh the the landing in in <span class="country">France</span> you know, when the Americans landed in <span class="country">France</span> and we were listening to the radio, but we were powerless. </sentence><sentence id="1626">We couldn't participate. </sentence><sentence id="1627">We could only listen and hope and pray that the war will end. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Then slowly came the news out about the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but it came only at the very end that we heard about the liberation of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and what went on there. </sentence><sentence id="1629">We had no, we didn't know anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="1630">So we had no more, you know, we didn't hear from my father anymore and as a matter of fact long afterwards somebody told us, I don't know if this is the truth or not, that he was put into one of those famous uh <span class="spatial object">railway cars</span> and that they died in there, that he never made it to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1631">I don't know whether this is reliable truth or not, but that's what we heard from people who said they knew him. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And my mother's brother didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="1633">He was in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1634">He was sent back. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And my grandparents and my husband's parents and actually only Mother and I made it through you know, through <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1636">So we went, when the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> sent us back to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> after a few months, about six or seven months after the end of the war, and my son was born there three years, two years, three years later, and we actually all wanted to go to <span class="country">Ecuador</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1637">I have an uncle in, my husband had an uncle in <span class="country">Ecuador</span> and after that didn't materialize it was always a delay and all things so my step-father, my mother had remarried in the meantime, and my, the brother of my step father had a <span class="dlf">farm</span> in , <span class="region">New Jersey</span> and he said if you'd like to come, you know, and we started working then we had to, started at the <span class="building">blouse factory</span> after I had been working in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> for blouses and I had uh taken some private lessons from the uh lady who did the models and who did the patterns. </sentence><sentence id="1638">I went at night to her place and learned that too, because the sewing alone wasn't enough, so I did this and my step father helped cut and my mother started selling and we had a beautiful little business going. </sentence><sentence id="1639">But like I said they presented us with the signature then that we were, we had promised to leave and our status was semi-legal. </sentence><sentence id="1640">I mean they prolonged, every six months they prolonged our papers you know. </sentence><sentence id="1641">But we weren't citizens and then my son was born and he, they made him , hot an enemy but German, and we didn't want our son growing up as German in <span class="country">Belgium</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1642">Today it doesn't make any difference I guess, but at that time that was the enemy you know, and having him go to <span class="building">school</span> or something as German, so we decided to go to <span class="country">America</span> where we can become citizens and live, you know, and he became a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1643">As a matter of fact the judge made him a better status than we are. </sentence><sentence id="1644">When he said, when we went, he made us citizens first and then he made him like an American born of naturalized Americans abroad. </sentence><sentence id="1645">He was born abroad, not that it made so much difference, but you know, he has an even better status than we have. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And that was very important to us. </sentence><sentence id="1647">I think we did the right thing, even though we liked <span class="country">Belgium</span> very much but for my son's life it is much better. </sentence><sentence id="1648">They both educated and they both have wonderful lives and  5 wonderful wives and children and they are full American and you know, like born here and this was the right decision I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
