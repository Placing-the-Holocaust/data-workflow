<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: Could you describe that a little bit, what you mean by cultural anti-Semitism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: Well, that we were not included in the human...you had you had groups uh who who did certain things, uh whether be it in sport or socially, and so I was not invited. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was not invited so it I didn't suffer from that, especially not when I, after my bar mitzvah, I joined the Jewish Youth Movement and which asserted me of my Jewish values and my Jewish heritage because that was also somehow I would say a turn in my life because I became uh active in that group. </sentence><sentence id="26">I was thirteen, fourteen years old, and uh it was a group uh uh which was believing in the uh in in political and ideological terms in a synthesis between uh Germans and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="27">In other words it was a non-Zionist movement. </sentence><sentence id="28">The uh major value of this was that you met the people who had uh were devoted towards this idealism and hoping for a new world, for a better world, and the working that go by working on yourself. </sentence><sentence id="29">That means in educational terms uh we  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection we we uh read. </sentence><sentence id="30">We were at this time influenced I remember by writings of Martin ; , studying the bible, studying our history...uh which as I say it was a very special value, but also uh uh by by trying to uh to make a contribution we did a lot of call it social work, which means taking care of needy uh uh children, especially uh uh children of our age in distress. </sentence><sentence id="31">We worked with them. </sentence><sentence id="32">We we we we invited them. </sentence><sentence id="33">We we tried to help them. </sentence><sentence id="34">We tried to alleviate their problems by just showing that we are there for them and for them, especially for children who came out from broken <span class="building">homes</span>, who had who had uh a brush with the law and so on, so that we considered them as uh as people who had to be saved and this was part of our work between our contribution to try to help them, and uh this was I would say very important because there we established personal friendships, uh girls and boys and and uh we we we we followed the principle of Boy Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="35">We we we discovered <span class="env feature">nature</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">We were hiking. </sentence><sentence id="37">We stayed overnight in <span class="building">tents</span> and we enjoyed the beauty of of of of <span class="env feature">nature</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">But at the same time we had very interesting evenings in discussions. </sentence><sentence id="39">People had to be prepared to deliver let us say a lecture about whatever the subject matter was, be it literature, philosophy, or whatever it is and Jewish and German kings or whatnot...general things, and that that was very, very attractive for all of us and and it gave us a certain sense of future responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="40">I would not say leadership but responsibility and therefore whatever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: We need you to stop... . </sentence><sentence id="61">They're not getting quite the angle they want. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="64">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Linda is asking me to have you personalize what you're saying a little more, how you as an individual experienced what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="67">Uh did you have a good friend in the Movement? </sentence><sentence id="68">What your favorite experience that you recall from those days? </sentence><sentence id="69">Did you have a leadership role, rather than a general, more of a...from your own eyes is what they're looking for, and also uh if you could, more about your family, talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="70">Also I don't think you mentioned the name of the movement, so when the tape starts again, you probably need to TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Would you continue to describe the the youth movement, its name and what you personally got out of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Well the name us first the called , which is the German-Jewish  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection my ideals and we we we uh worked together. </sentence><sentence id="74">We met actually during the week almost twice or three times on evenings. </sentence><sentence id="75">We met over the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="76">We we were hiking uh in the area around <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which is beautiful and uh then as I say we uh we were really call it enriching ourselves with with knowledge which which came about by exchanging news, by by putting people to work let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or whatever it is in whatever the <span class="region">area</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="77">At the same time I would not uh uh minimize the influence of my of my parents on on on me. </sentence><sentence id="78">We uh...my father, bless his memory, came from a very traditional <span class="building">home</span> in in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="populated place">Posen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="79">He had a very basic Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not orthodox but very conservative. </sentence><sentence id="80">Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially during the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war as a veteran became active in the Jewish War Veterans uh uh movement, also doing social work for needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed memory, joined the auxiliaries there and so we all...and my sister certainly was also active, so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs or the other, but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled around the uh the uh <span class="spatial object">family table</span> and that was Friday evening. </sentence><sentence id="81">Certainly having kiddish (ph) and having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us, but mainly after that then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week and the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all it was a wonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in spite of all the difficulties we had around us because the diff...the economical situation in <span class="country">Germany</span> during the inflation and then at the time of the Depression was not easy, but there was a warmth of a of a <span class="building">Jewish home</span> which which I appreciated very much and | think formed me and and and therefore my my my rightful family and my my love for family, it came from there uh and which was held up in all as I say in all...in spite of all difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="82">My father worked hard to make a living uh but on Friday night as they say in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this this was reflected uh in the observance of the rituals and then also in in a social way and uh uh that was known to us so and there there were no invitations sent out. </sentence><sentence id="83">People just dropped in and we were happy to have them and shared with them whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="84">Uh and uh in the youth movement, not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh they developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties became very...have remained very close, up to today. </sentence><sentence id="85">They are not too many people left survive, but some of them I I went to together to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and I lost them, but uh especially I must say when I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">I was sent by the <span class="building">United Jewish Appeal</span> in 1946 to this <span class="country">country</span> to bring the message of the survivors to to to the American Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="87">I met some of my old friends of that time and uh it was interesting that we could...as if nothing had happened in between. </sentence><sentence id="88">These ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and time. </sentence><sentence id="89">We got together again, irrespective of our changed political orientation in many a time or ideological orientation, but this tie...these personal ties were strong ties and have remained uh uh and I would say still today for ourselves, the old guard, we get together whenever we can and and this has remained. </sentence><sentence id="90">I also met my first wife in the youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="91">We were very young This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="92">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="93"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and uh and developed a relationship and and later uh uh we got married in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, so uh it it was uh a time which which somehow formed us in in in a certain way and I would say that my uh devotion to uh to uh, if I may say so, to uh things outside of personal interest, to do something for the <span class="populated place">community</span>, to do something for...to make it...try to make a contribution uh was...originated from the fact that I saw it in the <span class="building">house</span> of my parents who had dedicated their their time and life to certain things within these limits of their possibility, and later uh in the youth movement where we were educated in the belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for yourself. </sentence><sentence id="94">You have to try also to uh to uh to do something for people who who are less lucky than you are or or need your help and and and support. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: And until what age did you stay in the <span class="building">youth movement</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Actually I stayed in the youth move...youth movement as long as it existed, because in 1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="123">Uh we tried but in in spite...in other words they did not allow us to to continue uh to to operate. </sentence><sentence id="124">Certain other groups were still allowed to operate till 1938. </sentence><sentence id="125">We were not. </sentence><sentence id="126">In 1935 as I say, uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that uh uh we we uh kept our contacts. </sentence><sentence id="127">In other words, what we did was then that we we decided . </sentence><sentence id="128">Every week we had birthday celebrations. </sentence><sentence id="129">We came to...got together and uh well  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to stop the movement. </sentence><sentence id="130">They were not able to do it, so you had certainly a...during the Depression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to capitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh <span class="country">Germany</span> had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was not defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called <span class="building">home-front</span>, which means by social democrats and communists and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh since we had our own Jewish values, I would say, it didn't affect us what the Nazi were were were were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other hand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms. </sentence><sentence id="132">One consideration was that uh uh if Hitler should try to come to power, the uh the uh powers around <span class="country">Germany</span>...<span class="country">England</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>...would never...and <span class="country">Russia</span>...would never allow him to do so but this was certainly an illusion as we learned later, and irrespective of that uh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried to uh uh participate as actively as we could still in the cultural life of of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which was in this respect a wonderful <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">It was leading in the in the <span class="region">area</span> of music, <span class="building">theater</span>, literature, and so on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to participate to the best of our ability. </sentence><sentence id="134">In 1938..."31, I graduated from <span class="building">high school</span> and I entered the <span class="building">University of Berlin</span> to study law and economics and as students we had certain, certain privileges which...not privileges but certain uh when we went to the <span class="building">theater</span> or the <span class="building">opera</span>, it was for very cheap money and we we we uh it was then still an accepted fact that we participated fully as Germans in this life, last not least due to the fact that in this cultural life you had many uh leading Jewish personalities. </sentence><sentence id="135">After all, in a <span class="populated place">city</span> like <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>...it was a <span class="populated place">city</span> of Einstein, in the field of music of ____ and Otto (ph) and and and so and and say we uh we uh we really uh enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="136">Still we we were concerned about the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a democratic way, uh were able to uh to uh add to their power because when it came to voting they increased their seats in the in the <span class="building">Parliament</span>, especially in the years of 1931 and 1932. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh life at the <span class="building">University</span>, for instance, already was also influenced by the...rcemember that, you know, there was there was uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the <span class="interior space">lobby</span> of the <span class="building">University</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, Jewish groups, the the leftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not leftists...democratic groups, but also the Nazis and that didn't take long and uh there were brawls and there was fighting and so and since the <span class="building">University</span> was ex-territorial, uh they didn't allow the police to interfere so it was very unpleasant but the uh <span class="building">classes</span> and also the classes of the Jewish professors, were not actually affected, at least not in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">There was cases in <span class="populated place">Bressler</span> (ph) we know where they where they tried to disturb <span class="building">classes</span> and so on, but not in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and uh uh on the other hand uh also amongst the students it was taken up, amongst the intellectuals who originally very much from the conservative groups of <span class="country">Germany</span>, who had never become uh uh uh engaged in the principles of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> or democratic principles. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh there was no real rebirth. </sentence><sentence id="140">I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in <span class="country">Germany</span> did not become a real fundamental political system, and uh especially these these uh nationalistic conserve...conservative groups called , they uh were uh...they produced most of the students. </sentence><sentence id="141">Also due to the fact  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the of the of the progressive let us say, so we had our our our difficulties and still uh irrespective we we did our work as students and uh and uh then when Hitler came to power on January 30th, 1933...] remember that day very well. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was a student then and I had taken my <span class="spatial object">classes</span> and then all of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been called in to <span class="building">office</span> by the German President. </sentence><sentence id="143">Now I want to emphasize that uh this was done in a very democratic way, which means that uh that there was no uprising. </sentence><sentence id="144">I didn't see... remember in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> when I came <span class="building">home</span> from from the <span class="building">University</span>, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">Just the other way around the Nazis prepared for the tremendous torchlight procession they they they had organized for Hitler on on the evening, and there was no opposition. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh to emphasize in a very democratic way which means that that uh and this was the shock we had that he had actually succeeded in killing democracy in <span class="country">Germany</span> with a means of democracy. </sentence><sentence id="147">Uh at the beginning in the first couple of days uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies and the militants amongst the Nazis, especially the Brown Militia then tried to take revenge against their opponents, but uh I luckily was not affected uh but we heard there was quite a number of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get even with their political opponents, especially social democrats, democrats and so on. </sentence><sentence id="148">And there were a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police. </sentence><sentence id="149">In certain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at this time Nazified completely tried to help uh but also they...but slowly this this this uh disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="150">So uh after a certain while uh this uh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh accepted the power more in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection though it was more difficult for my for my father to continue his work as a commissioned agent. </sentence><sentence id="151">On the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're hear this...uh one of the things Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a new order. </sentence><sentence id="152">My my father, for instance, had come <span class="building">home</span> with his decorations, his Iron Cross which was considered...was...he cherished it very much, so then one of the things Hitler did in "33 was to establish a a special medal for those people who had seen active service at the front, and my father was a beneficiary of that which means that even Jews who had served in World War I also got this decoration, in the name of the Fuhrer, absurd as it may sound today. </sentence><sentence id="153">So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had were non-Jews, I mean this decoration which you could display in a certain way, helped him so he was still accepted as a as a German, if you want to, because at this time there were no Jewish...special Jewish or something like. </sentence><sentence id="154">That came later. </sentence><sentence id="155">But things uh things uh...and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection say thought to go to <span class="region">South America</span> or to <span class="region">North America</span> and and enter agricultural life in these <span class="country">countries</span>, to give them the tools and the education. </sentence><sentence id="156">In 1935, as I said, I I entered a <span class="building">firm</span> which...a <span class="building">Jewish firm</span>...which was active in the export-import business, especially in metals and and ore, doing business with <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">LONG PAUSE IN TAPE ...So that people hopefully will learn something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: . </sentence><sentence id="204">It was interesting to me that as people get older and they remember all these things from early on in their lives, it means that nothing is ever lost. </sentence><sentence id="205">It's all in there somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="206">It's just not easily retrieved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="212">And certain people don't forget one , you know. </sentence><sentence id="213">They cannot live memory.

be helpful if if if need be. </sentence><sentence id="218">And uh so these were also the years where let me say that uh in spite of the Nuremburg Laws which which were established in in then made it clear that Jews couldn't members of the of the German , German people and uh uh created the uh the uh laws about racial racial uh associations and so in other words uh for...were forbidding the marriage of Jews and non-Jews and certainly we we we uh we...I wouldn't say we accepted this but on the other hand we also said it doesn't affect us in our Jewish attitude, in our in our...in the judgment what our Jewish values were. </sentence><sentence id="219">We...and I can say also personally...I said the Nazis cannot tell me what kind of a human being I am. </sentence><sentence id="220">I'm a Jew and proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="221">I will not and cannot deny that that <span class="country">Germany</span>, German culture, German language, formed my my my my uh formed my my intellectual being, but the Nazis have no uh...even if they do this, if they consider Jews as second-class human beings, it doesn't affect me because I'm I'm I'm proud...and that as I say, the uh the uh education in the in my <span class="building">home</span> and in the youth movement had given me that certainty that that I didn't feel offended by it. </sentence><sentence id="222">What I felt influenced by it, certainly did not develop any inferiority complex, or any inferiority complex, so and then came 1936 were the Olympic Games where where all political radical activities in <span class="country">Germany</span> came to a certain halt in order to to present to the world the best face <span class="country">Germany</span> could show. </sentence><sentence id="223">And as you probably know, also the American team which came to <span class="country">Germany</span> was very much affected. </sentence><sentence id="224">The head of the team, Mr.

what Nazism and the racial superiority com....and <span class="building">racial superiority complex</span> meant to them. </sentence><sentence id="226">Then in the years "37, "38, uh when Hitler felt that his power was growing and that also the uh German army got got stronger, uh and uh the the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion that there should be more radical solutions as far as the Jews are concerned and they could then _ slowly feel that uh they tried to exclude Jews more effectively from all ways of life and and especially in "38 I remember uh <span class="building">department

there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="301">Even when I discussed it with my wife and my parents, uh there was helplessness, absolute helplessness. </sentence><sentence id="302">And and we we felt lost by the world. </sentence><sentence id="303">Now uh then one evening when I was doing this work, the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said, listen, I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name was the of Jews from <span class="country">Germany</span>, which means the representative of the rights of Jews in <span

like uh uh Viscount Samuel (ph) and and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh oppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppressed children so uh uh this is is now to be organized also from here, from <span class="country">Germany</span> and uh Mr. Hirsch said well, we have terrific social workers who gradually were flocking back to the <span

you would call it ,in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 them, and uh had...were restricted to the age of twelve to seventeen because this would be considered the age where they could be...could go without the accompaniment of their parents and and and uh wouldn't create special educational problems. </sentence><sentence

who who was an escort, they call it protection letter which he could use for the <span class="building">border police</span> to say and it said that so and so, in my case Norbert Israel Wolheim, you

was a very uh uh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a chance to go to <span class="country">England</span> certainly looked for a chance, and there

obey their order, then these these <span class="spatial object">transports</span> would come to an end and this certainly we could not afford. </sentence><sentence id="322">So as I say, I was very,

to change the departure date from September Ist to August 29, and I decided then uh on account of the situation not to be the leader of that <span class="spatial object">transport</span> because uh my

a group, just a <span class="spatial object">death wagon</span> of a hundred people, most probably ninety percent of them did not live to see the next evening anymore, but still riding in that <span

children and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw people in in a certain uniform I had never seen before, with stripped clothing and peculiar kind of a of a of a cap, and uh so then <span

these people had. </sentence><sentence id="625">It was not fitting, you know...it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="626">And some caps also with the same stripes, and then we were led to one of the <span class="building">barracks</span> we had seen there in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> and a man who called himself the elder, the block elder, blockaltester, block elder received us. </sentence><sentence id="627">He was a political prisoner who was uh allied with the communist party and so and had been caught very early, so he had already seven or eight years of imprisonment behind him, and he said I want you to be clean. </sentence><sentence id="628">I want you to ____ and so and we were then given our our <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, which means in this <span class="building">barracks</span> there were rows of <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, three tiers and there was...there was a thin blanket and the so-called <span

your things. </sentence><sentence id="630">There was...there was uh no place uh to rest, to sit down, so uh...and then I realized that uh...the events were so fast and so over-bearing and so shocking that it was not possible for me to fully analyze what was going on, but uh I realized one thing that certainly uh I I...that the Nazis had tried to dehumanize me by taking away all my private...my most private things, my hair, my clothing, to make me a number and that I was degraded to to become a slave, that I was a prisoner, that uh I was not any more able to do what I wanted to do, that I had to uh follow uh orders...how nonsensical they were...and uh that that all this in the name, I said, of German civilization...1 was puzzled. </sentence><sentence id="631">And also uh especially then came a little bit...got used to this...came to the realization that there was no way out because uh certainly the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was was was surrounded by more than one <span class="dlf">fence</span> of <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, was electrically loaded, that to run away would be impossible and even if so, in a <span class="region">Polish area</span>...it was still a Polish population where you don't know the language...was hopeless, so that the only hope which was there is to to live to to see uh that <span class="country">Germany</span> was

id="729">So I said I was a welder and then we got we got...uh I got my number, which was 107984. </sentence><sentence id="730">Uh we had to...I had to...I got some patches of of of stuff of linen and and had to to sew it on my uniform, and also then uh somebody came and tattooed this number on my left arm, so uh that means I I I...and I still have that...uh which means that you were completely uh uh...you were...you have become a number and one of the first things I said to myself is I would like to become not a number. </sentence><sentence id="731">I had a number but I'd like not to become a number, so still there was that spirit of resistance if possible. </sentence><sentence id="732">And then on that first day also I 1 went through something which never uh uh experienced before, what they call appell. </sentence><sentence id="733">The Germans and the Nazis, they are in this respect and especially at this time, they had obstinent appell, you know, and counting was one of their hobbies. </sentence><sentence id="734">Uh and they had it at least twice a day, so we were all led to a big place, a big <span class="dlf">square</span> and there we had to line up...our <span class="dlf">block</span>...in in rows of five and had to wait until an SS man came, and there were...were the head of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the SS that was...the <span class="spatial object">SS stormfurher</span> which means captain. </sentence><sentence id="735">Uh since it was cold, he had the privilege of wearing a nice fur coat, uh a military fur coat, so we were counted again and again and again, and uh uh then uh the next day, it was the first day when when when I was I was uh uh commanded, after the appell in the morning, to go to a certain kommando they called it, working...working uh squad or working platoon, and uh the newcomers had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="736">They were attached to a very special one. </sentence><sentence id="737">I only later I found this one of the kommands to uh to wear us down, to grind us down, uh which we called , the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further

and how we are doing it, that it went fast enough and so on. </sentence><sentence id="738">And uh I remember that on that first day uh when we were when we were doing this kind of work and I had done part of it in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> so it was not completely new to me...I I saw that one Jewish fellow of another kommando uh throw himself in front of a <span class="spatial

more. </sentence><sentence id="739">So uh when it came to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break, some <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came with some watery soup which was called buna (ph) soup because the name of that <span class="building">factory</span> was <span class="populated place">Buna</span> and it was provided by the firm which they think was a tremendous uh tremendous gain for us. </sentence><sentence id="740">It was very often absolutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing but just <span class="env feature">water</span> uh uh with some some vegetable remnants or so. </sentence><sentence id="741">It's awful. </sentence><sentence id="742">And so uh and since...and also we had...there was...yeah...one of our possessions was uh a <span class="spatial

sit down and so it all has to be...had to eaten standing up and then after a short while the the work continued up to the very end of the day. </sentence><sentence id="745">So at the beginning...I mean it was hard but but but I also considered bearable, but then, you know, not a couple of days later...was early in March, uh terrible rain storms hit the <span class="region">area</span> and the <span class="region">area</span> became muddier than before so the work became more difficult, especially when you have to carry these cement bags. </sentence><sentence id="746">That was not...the paper was not of the best quality so they very often broke and when you mix cement with water, you know, it it becomes very hard caked and it was setting also on your clothing and so...now the other problem was that I couldn't change...change the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="747">II L...there was no way to clean yourself. </sentence><sentence id="748">There was so-called <span

result in typhus. </sentence><sentence id="750">So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that was one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb anymore because you had no hair, but you even didn't also didn't have a towel. </sentence><sentence id="751">You had...really you had practically...you were devoid of any things uh uh which makes fundamentals

it so happened when I was in the <span class="dlf">block</span> with my friends I said watch that somebody should discover us and uh I read it and it so happened that was a piece with the report of the of the German Wiermacht saying that they had been driven out of <span class="populated place">Krackow</span> (ph) which gave me an idea that the <span class="region">front</span>, the <span class="region">Russian front</span>, was advancing, but more I didn't know, but somehow it it added again, you know, to the spark of life and uh then uh there was another day when I almost lost uh my my my uh belief that I would be able to make it. </sentence><sentence id="756">In our group was a man who uh uh was very active also in our youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="757">He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil employee, and he was a man with a beautiful voice. </sentence><sentence id="758">He had studied music because he wanted to become a cantor, and he had been in another <span

id="760">He said I've had enough. </sentence><sentence id="761">I can't take it any longer. </sentence><sentence id="762">I said what are you going to do. </sentence><sentence id="763">He said I have uh...I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="764">I went to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="765">After three days they threw me out. </sentence><sentence id="766">I can hardly stand on my feet and I don't like to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rather take my own life, so I argued with him. </sentence><sentence id="767">I said Fritz, how can you do it. </sentence><sentence id="768">Think what we have gone through. </sentence><sentence id="769">Think what we have been taught. </sentence><sentence id="770">How can you take your own life. </sentence><sentence id="771">After all, you are observant Jew. </sentence><sentence id="772">It's un-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="773">He said, this is my decision. </sentence><sentence id="774">I don't want to be to be to be kicked to death, because what happened here...for this there is no provision in the bible and in in our scriptures, and the next day I heard in the morning whatever shooting going on during the night. </sentence><sentence id="775">Very often the SS guards on the <span class="building">tower</span>, they were sometimes shooting because...to keep themselves awake let us say, and they could order you...they had these Jews that they saw something in there for the...it was suspicious and therefore they were firing, so uh so we heard shooting constantly, and next day somebody said you know, did you hear the shooting this morning. </sentence><sentence id="776">I said yes, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="777">They said your friend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he tried to be admitted to the to the <span class="building">hospital</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="778">They didn't accept him, so he said under those conditionsII1___ went against the...you know, this was one of the ways in which people also put an end to their misery. </sentence><sentence id="779">They went to the to the <span

the <span class="dlf">wire</span> in order to be shot and and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="780">And I remember it still...it was on April 3rd, 1940..."43, soon after we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="781">Uh so when I heard this, I must say I 1 1 1 was almost lost because I had lost a battle and I saw the parallel and I was uh said...asking myself how long will we all be able to make that, and then uh one day or two days later, all of a sudden there was uh uh a special roll call that people should register again their their their uh profession, so that gave me another hope and uh there was what they called the labor service, . </sentence><sentence id="782">Again registered and I registered myself again as  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org

know, when you wanted to go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and so you had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap and asking for permission, for his permission and so on and what they did in order to play around was very often to take, when you when you take off your cap, take the cap and throw it away and when the moment when you...when the people went to get, to collect the cap, then the SS man was shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and this this was the uh the situation the first couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="785">Also in connection with the <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> defeat uh they then came to the conclusion that they wanted to save manpower and they organized the uh the uh guards in such a way that they were surrounding completely the whole <span class="region">area</span> of that <span class="building">industrial complex</span>, so that when we marched out, when we got into into into the <span class="region">factory area</span>, the SS stayed outside uh keeping guard out...yeah, keeping guard outside but we marched in only with the <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="786">And that alleviated certainly the situation somehow because then the kapos in order to keep their pos...their position who were very, very rough with their own people...they were mostly German criminals and and anti-social elements and so they then were not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become tougher with the...so this helped somehow, but still it was no no no no solution and and as I say, I 1 11 thought what what...still I was able to move but but I said something has to had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="787">For instance, we were then...I was put in another kommando under the command of a kapo who was a Polish criminal. </sentence><sentence id="788">He had committed one or two murders uh and and he was such a human being the only regret he had that he had waited too long to murder his wife and his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was taking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for one reason or the other because uh...so uh he was a kapo there and he had uh used the foul language especially in Polish, because he was also was also one of these ethnic Germans who didn't know exactly where they belonged. </sentence><sentence id="789">You know, they they they they they had a double standard. </sentence><sentence id="790">They wanted to be Germans, and at the same time uh uh they wanted to to remain with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head of a digging kommando, and that was also that was that that uh he was called in a German expression was Juden Franz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="791">Franz is a German name, but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he got because he was a grinder of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="792">He had shown so many Jewish uh casualties on his conscious. </sentence><sentence id="793">And he would always say, well I had to do it in order to enforce the _, and we were not protected. </sentence><sentence id="794">There was no protected because not only had I lost my my my name and my hair and my clothing and my family...I also had had lost completely my my right to claim any human rights. </sentence><sentence id="795">And uh that's what certainly these these people, these gangsters knew very well that there was no protection and uh then one day uh the uh the uh...we were called again to the <span class="building">labor

<span class="building">barracks</span> and had not the daily contact with my friends there who were still doing work and as | in that terrible kommando there. </sentence><sentence id="799">Well, uh so uh uh especially, as I say, uh uh at the beginning uh life or the day in in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was simply a day of getting up, starting to run, uh being exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockaltester or kapo, so hardly be able to to sit, uh watching what what what uh left and right uh what what was happening so that it shouldn't happen to you and especially uh to to try to to do the work, which was not work, which was really slave work reminding you somehow of the illustrations you saw inthe ___-- when the Jews in in <span class="country">Egypt</span> were building the <span class="building">pyramids</span>. </sentence><sentence id="800">Uh it, as I say, it improved somehow, and I felt at least the improvement uh when when when the SS guards were taken

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="878">Q: At that point did you make a decision to try to ration your energy very carefully? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="880">How soon did you do that... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: Especially when I when when I came to the conclusion that what little I had, I had to to stretch out my energy. </sentence><sentence id="882">For instance, there was...I don't know if it's right, but I got the bread in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="883">I didn't eat it immediately. </sentence><sentence id="884">I kept a little bit and kept it in my <span class="spatial object">pocket</span> somehow so that they say, when when it's drier, then it has more nourishing value, or one instance I tried to uh to uh to uh...especially after the <span class="spatial object">SS</span> was taken away from the <span class="building">kommandos</span>, to go to the to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> unobserved as often as possible to have to have a minute of rest, or for instance uh you know, uh uh we had as tool only our bowl and a and a and a and a spoon. </sentence><sentence id="885">Now I came to the conclusion in order to cut the bread...we had no knives certainly. </sentence><sentence id="886">That was dangerous for the Germans, for the <span class="populated place">German state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="887">Uh I sharpened part of that of that <span class="spatial object">spoon</span> so that it was easier somehow to cut in order to save energy and and and this...and also uh uh uh what I tried in spite of all obstacles to to to remain clean. </sentence><sentence id="888">Uh because I realized that the moment I would give in, that could be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I was working for that first German meister, uh uh who was who was more or less pleasant, uh uh because he treated me not as an inmate, as a heftling, as a slave. </sentence><sentence id="889">He treated me as somebody who was like a helper or uh...not in his category but as a helper and uh then I tried, you know, to sit down as often as possible and to to relax to to...whenever I could and not to exert myself, do anything special, certainly not to run anymore and so to try to to to walk in a way that that I don't consume too much ener...energy. </sentence><sentence id="890">Uh after a certain while I lost that job because there was a conflict between and the and the and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 very proud in his work, so at the beginning it was not so easy because I was not an accomplished welder, but I tried to learn from him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness, he treated me like an equal. </sentence><sentence id="891">And when he saw that I made progress in whatever he wanted me to do, then he gave me some cigarettes uh which I didn't use certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes for bread which was very important, also to to get up some more energy. </sentence><sentence id="892">And uh uh so uh also what was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I worked with him I could work under a <span class="dlf">roof</span> so that the elements...I was not exposed to the elements. </sentence><sentence id="893">I also remember that uh when I entered this <span class="building">building</span> where I worked then, I for the first time in weeks I saw a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span>, and I looked myself into the <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> and I was aghast. </sentence><sentence id="894">I was simply...I 1 1 mean this was the worst, one of the worst things I must say that happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="895">I didn't recognize myself anymore, certainly without hair, unshaven you know, because we had a chance only to to be shaven once a week, and I said for goodness sake, what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="896">Uh uh but still the fact that I was somehow now in a better position helped me tremendously and and I was still felt sorry that for my other friends that they having no skill and having nothing to offer in this respect were not able to alleviate their situation somehow, and uh so I I I worked with this man for a certain while and again then something changed uh because because uh uh uh they wanted to have welders in in in in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> directly. </sentence><sentence id="897">There was a <span class="spatial object">welder kommando</span> and the <span class="building">Buna</span> was constantly expanding and at the beginning when I came, the total of was approximately two thousand or two thousand five hundred. </sentence><sentence id="898">Then we we we grew to approximately ten thousand. </sentence><sentence id="899">What they did was also that uh they uh and the Germans were...the Nazis did things which are not well known but should be should be recorded. </sentence><sentence id="900">At a certain time, they established <span class="building">brothels</span> for the German uh inmates and the Polish inmates, and they brought prostitutes from <span

the middle of the and we were called to uh to do the heating there, to establish the heating so they needed welders and I was one of them which gave me a tremendous uh uh...which was a tremendous help. </sentence><sentence id="902">Number one, I mean I was suffering from certain , from from swollen feet, so I didn't have to walk these long  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 sure enough this lady, a wonderful lady, wrote back and and sent money and some food to this Polish man, so I left him with the money because I couldn't use the money. </sentence><sentence id="903">It was too dangerous but he gave me the food and that was manna for me. </sentence><sentence id="904">So uh uh and also this... === s was his name...he had a very interesting technique. </sentence><sentence id="905">Since he hated the Germans so much, uh and hated certainly to work for _ for the war effort, he had developed a certain technique, you know, when you weld <span class="dlf">pipes</span> you have to be very careful because uh under high pressure they could burst easily and therefore you have to be have to be very accurate. </sentence><sentence id="906">I knew how to do this. </sentence><sentence id="907">I knew how to do it, and then he taught me how to do it that it looked good from the outside, was bad

the pressure...and the <span class="dlf">pipes</span> would not be able to to to to tolerate the pressure. </sentence><sentence id="908">Uh and that's how...I say when I worked with him for the first time, we established a contact. </sentence><sentence id="909">Then I I worked in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for the...partly to establish that <span class="building">brothel</span> and then when I was working in the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> I heard one day that there were British prisoners of war who had appeared in that <span class="building">factory</span>

the German civilians was the best. </sentence><sentence id="915">For the English prisoners of war, theirs was in between, but they didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="916">They didn't want it because luckily they had their <span class="building">International Red Cross</span> parcels, so, therefore, they had already clients amongst our people, our inmates, to give them the soup which was

actually I had British...when I walked out from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I had British socks. </sentence><sentence id="918">I had British shoes. </sentence><sentence id="919">I
