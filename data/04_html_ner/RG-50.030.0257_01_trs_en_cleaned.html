experience that you recall from those days? </sentence><sentence id="74">Did you have a leadership role, rather than a general, more of a...from your own eyes is what they're looking for, and also uh if you could, more about your family, talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="75">Also I don't think you mentioned the name of the movement, so when the tape starts again, you probably need to TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Would you continue to describe the the youth movement, its name and what you personally got out of it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Well the name us first the called , which is the German-Jewish Youth uh uh Alliance and later called , the Association of Jewish Youth, and and uh what I got out of it was that uh I found people of my age and and my call it mentality and and uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="78">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="79"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection my ideals and we we we uh worked together. </sentence><sentence id="80">We met actually during the week almost twice or three times on evenings. </sentence><sentence id="81">We met over the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="82">We we were hiking uh in the area around <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which is beautiful and uh then as I say we uh we were really call it enriching ourselves with with knowledge which which came about by exchanging news, by by putting people to work let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or whatever it is in whatever the <span class="region">area</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="83">At the same time I would not uh uh minimize the influence of my of my parents on on on me. </sentence><sentence id="84">We uh...my father, bless his memory, came from a very traditional <span class="building">home</span> in in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="populated place">Posen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="85">He had a very basic Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not orthodox but very conservative. </sentence><sentence id="86">Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially during the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war as a veteran became active in the Jewish War Veterans uh uh movement, also doing social work for needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed memory, joined the auxiliaries there and so we all...and my sister certainly was also active, so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs or the other, but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled around the uh the uh <span class="spatial object">family table</span> and that was Friday evening. </sentence><sentence id="87">Certainly having kiddish (ph) and having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us, but mainly after that then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week and the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all it was a wonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in spite of all the difficulties we had around us because the diff...the economical situation in <span class="country">Germany</span> during the inflation and then at the time of the Depression was not easy, but there was a warmth of a of a <span class="building">Jewish home</span> which which I appreciated very much and | think formed me and and and therefore my my my rightful family and my my love for family, it came from there uh and which was held up in all as I say in all...in spite of all difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="88">My father worked hard to make a living uh but on Friday night as they say in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this this was reflected uh in the observance of the rituals and then also in in a social way and uh uh that was known to us so and there there were no invitations sent out. </sentence><sentence id="89">People just dropped in and we were happy to have them and shared with them whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="90">Uh and uh in the youth movement, not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh they developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties became very...have remained very close, up to today. </sentence><sentence id="91">They are not too many people left survive, but some of them I I went to together to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and I lost them, but uh especially I must say when I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">I was sent by the <span class="building">United Jewish Appeal</span> in 1946 to this <span class="country">country</span> to bring the message of the survivors to to to the American Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="93">I met some of my old friends of that time and uh it was interesting that we could...as if nothing had happened in between. </sentence><sentence id="94">These ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and time. </sentence><sentence id="95">We got together again, irrespective of our changed political orientation in many a time or ideological orientation, but this tie...these personal ties were strong ties and have remained uh uh and I would say still today for ourselves, the old guard, we get together whenever we can and and this has remained. </sentence><sentence id="96">I also met my first wife in the youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="97">We were very young This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="98">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="99"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and uh and developed a relationship and and later uh uh we got married in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, so uh it it was uh a time which which somehow formed us in in in a certain way and I would say that my uh devotion to uh to uh, if I may say so, to uh things outside of personal interest, to do something for the <span class="populated place">community</span>, to do something for...to make it...try to make a contribution uh was...originated from the fact that I saw it in the <span class="building">house</span> of my parents who had dedicated their their time and life to certain things within these limits of their possibility, and later uh in the youth movement where we were educated in the belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for yourself. </sentence><sentence id="100">You have to try also to uh to uh to do something for people who who are less lucky than you are or or need your help and and and support. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: And until what age did you stay in the <span class="building">youth movement</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Actually I stayed in the youth move...youth movement as long as it existed, because in 1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh we tried but in in spite...in other words they did not allow us to to continue uh to to operate. </sentence><sentence id="132">Certain other groups were still allowed to operate till 1938. </sentence><sentence id="133">We were not. </sentence><sentence id="134">In 1935 as I say, uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that uh uh we we uh kept our contacts. </sentence><sentence id="135">In other words, what we did was then that we we decided . </sentence><sentence id="136">Every week we had birthday celebrations. </sentence><sentence id="137">We came to...got together and uh well certainly under the Nazi time things had changed completely with uh our approach to...or our thinking in political and ideological terms changed. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh there came a time when we came to the conclusion that that there is no future for for for Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> and we should help to prepare young people to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>, especially in the years 1940...1935, "36 when slowly but surely uh we we did understand that uh uh uh the Nazi regime was there to stay, that it was not a transitory uh thing, and that uh uh uh uh there was, as I said, no future for for...especially for young people. </sentence><sentence id="139">So uh uh if you want to...I've never left the the the <span class="building">Youth Movement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">It it's still in me somehow and uh interesting enough, this is something which...a pheno...phenomenon which is not only restricted to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">When I speak with my friends from the <span class="region">east</span>, uh there was also something that they called the youth movement and it's interesting when you meet the people who are who are came out of that, they have a certain special approach to to the Jewish community and to to life which I share very much with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="156">Can you begin to describe now about Hitler's rise to power and how that affected you and and the Jewish __ in the early "30's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, uh uh this is a loaded question uh because certainly in the "20's uh uh the Nazi uh uh party became stronger and stronger. </sentence><sentence id="160">There were differences of opinion...would they last, would they not last, but uh given the political weakness of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> which was not uh uh able to enamor itself to the to the people, the fact that the uh democratic parties and the social democrats lost more and more in influence...uh uh we we...in spite of all that we thought that the Republic would do...the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> uh representatives would do something to try This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="161">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="162"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to stop the movement. </sentence><sentence id="163">They were not able to do it, so you had certainly a...during the Depression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to capitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh <span class="country">Germany</span> had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was not defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called <span class="building">home-front</span>, which means by social democrats and communists and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="164">Uh since we had our own Jewish values, I would say, it didn't affect us what the Nazi were were were were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other hand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms. </sentence><sentence id="165">One consideration was that uh uh if Hitler should try to come to power, the uh the uh powers around <span class="country">Germany</span>...<span class="country">England</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>...would never...and <span class="country">Russia</span>...would never allow him to do so but this was certainly an illusion as we learned later, and irrespective of that uh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried to uh uh participate as actively as we could still in the cultural life of of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which was in this respect a wonderful <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was leading in the in the <span class="region">area</span> of music, <span class="building">theater</span>, literature, and so on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to participate to the best of our ability. </sentence><sentence id="167">In 1938..."31, I graduated from <span class="building">high school</span> and I entered the <span class="building">University of Berlin</span> to study law and economics and as students we had certain, certain privileges which...not privileges but certain uh when we went to the <span class="building">theater</span> or the <span class="building">opera</span>, it was for very cheap money and we we we uh it was then still an accepted fact that we participated fully as Germans in this life, last not least due to the fact that in this cultural life you had many uh leading Jewish personalities. </sentence><sentence id="168">After all, in a <span class="populated place">city</span> like <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>...it was a <span class="populated place">city</span> of Einstein, in the field of music of ____ and Otto (ph) and and and so and and say we uh we uh we really uh enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="169">Still we we were concerned about the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a democratic way, uh were able to uh to uh add to their power because when it came to voting they increased their seats in the in the <span class="building">Parliament</span>, especially in the years of 1931 and 1932. </sentence><sentence id="170">Uh life at the <span class="building">University</span>, for instance, already was also influenced by the...rcemember that, you know, there was there was uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the <span class="interior space">lobby</span> of the <span class="building">University</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, Jewish groups, the the leftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not leftists...democratic groups, but also the Nazis and that didn't take long and uh there were brawls and there was fighting and so and since the <span class="building">University</span> was ex-territorial, uh they didn't allow the police to interfere so it was very unpleasant but the uh <span class="building">classes</span> and also the classes of the Jewish professors, were not actually affected, at least not in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">There was cases in <span class="populated place">Bressler</span> (ph) we know where they where they tried to disturb <span class="building">classes</span> and so on, but not in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and uh uh on the other hand uh also amongst the students it was taken up, amongst the intellectuals who originally very much from the conservative groups of <span class="country">Germany</span>, who had never become uh uh uh engaged in the principles of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> or democratic principles. </sentence><sentence id="172">Uh there was no real rebirth. </sentence><sentence id="173">I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in <span class="country">Germany</span> did not become a real fundamental political system, and uh especially these these uh nationalistic conserve...conservative groups called , they uh were uh...they produced most of the students. </sentence><sentence id="174">Also due to the fact that uh uh then education became a monopoly of the of the uh more wealthier democracy in in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">There was not enough done in order to get people also out of less wealthier groups of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="176">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="177"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the of the of the progressive let us say, so we had our our our difficulties and still uh irrespective we we did our work as students and uh and uh then when Hitler came to power on January 30th, 1933...] remember that day very well. </sentence><sentence id="178">I was a student then and I had taken my <span class="spatial object">classes</span> and then all of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been called in to <span class="building">office</span> by the German President. </sentence><sentence id="179">Now I want to emphasize that uh this was done in a very democratic way, which means that uh that there was no uprising. </sentence><sentence id="180">I didn't see... remember in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> when I came <span class="building">home</span> from from the <span class="building">University</span>, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">Just the other way around the Nazis prepared for the tremendous torchlight procession they they they had organized for Hitler on on the evening, and there was no opposition. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh to emphasize in a very democratic way which means that that uh and this was the shock we had that he had actually succeeded in killing democracy in <span class="country">Germany</span> with a means of democracy. </sentence><sentence id="183">Uh at the beginning in the first couple of days uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies and the militants amongst the Nazis, especially the Brown Militia then tried to take revenge against their opponents, but uh I luckily was not affected uh but we heard there was quite a number of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get even with their political opponents, especially social democrats, democrats and so on. </sentence><sentence id="184">And there were a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police. </sentence><sentence id="185">In certain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at this time Nazified completely tried to help uh but also they...but slowly this this this uh disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="186">So uh after a certain while uh this uh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh accepted the power more in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the uh and obviously it's my opinion that the Nazis had anactof___--.~ They promulgated very stringent laws taking away the uh the basic rights of people uh and uh then I came to the conclusion that most probably to continue studies at the <span class="building">University</span> for law or of law uh would uh would not guarantee me any future. </sentence><sentence id="187">After April 1st, 1933, certain uh laws were promulgated whereby doctorsand__, uh Jewish doctors, Jewish doctors, lost their license, with the exception of those who had served as veterans in World War I, and since my father was uh uh...had seen action in World War I in <span class="country">France</span> and in <span class="country">Russia</span>, I was entitled to continue uh with my studies, but as I say I did...came to the conclusion that uh this would not guarantee me a future, not in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so then in uh in uh April-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I was volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth movement, the work done...especially the social work being done was always connected with the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">The <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was aa very well-organized entity and had departments for the care from the cradle to the <span class="dlf">grave</span>, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="189">Uh uh babies" <span class="building">homes</span> and <span class="building">old age homes</span> and so on, and we had a special department also for youth work and we were uh associated with that group. </sentence><sentence id="190">Don't forget the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> uh uh consists of approximately two and one half thousand members. </sentence><sentence id="191">There was a certain tax system under which people paid uh like they paid their income tax, they paid their Jewish taxes, and the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> financed all the activities out of these funds. </sentence><sentence id="192">In addition certainly there was certain private donations. </sentence><sentence id="193">So uh what I did was then I uh I became more active in in in this work, looking for something else but then in 19...and my my my family uh was not personally affected This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="194">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="195"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection though it was more difficult for my for my father to continue his work as a commissioned agent. </sentence><sentence id="196">On the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're hear this...uh one of the things Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a new order. </sentence><sentence id="197">My my father, for instance, had come <span class="building">home</span> with his decorations, his Iron Cross which was considered...was...he cherished it very much, so then one of the things Hitler did in "33 was to establish a a special medal for those people who had seen active service at the front, and my father was a beneficiary of that which means that even Jews who had served in World War I also got this decoration, in the name of the Fuhrer, absurd as it may sound today. </sentence><sentence id="198">So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had were non-Jews, I mean this decoration which you could display in a certain way, helped him so he was still accepted as a as a German, if you want to, because at this time there were no Jewish...special Jewish or something like. </sentence><sentence id="199">That came later. </sentence><sentence id="200">But things uh things uh...and then interesting enough uh somehow by his force...by his...by introduction of certain uh laws alleviating the economical hardships and certainly the rearmament on which <span class="country">Germany</span> started, the economy somehow improved, uh believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="201">And uh things also in this respect became somehow easier for my father and and he didn't bad...do badly, to the same extent that uh you can say that Jewish business did not... mean certain of them closed but Jewish business, <span class="building">retail stores</span> and so on continued to exist. </sentence><sentence id="202">Depart...<span class="building">Jewish department stores</span> continued to exist and had a...benefitted from the improvement of that situation and especially when it came to 1936 when we had the Olympic Games in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, then the Nazis for propaganda reasons certainly stayed away from any from any hostile activities and so on. </sentence><sentence id="203">Also because in connection with the political developments, the Nazis uh very gradually uh tightened the screws. </sentence><sentence id="204">In other words, they they didn't start with the Holocaust immediately. </sentence><sentence id="205">It it was that they they started to feel their way around. </sentence><sentence id="206">They had to establish they have power. </sentence><sentence id="207">After they had taken care of all the opponents, the communists and the social democrats, the democrats, then they they they they uh uh felt that they were independently powerful and didn't have to listen to uh to uh any anybody else and in in this this gave them then also uh as we all know unfortunately a power to to stre...to stretch their muscles in in international terms. </sentence><sentence id="208">In other words, the expectation we had that eventually the powers like <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">England</span> and so forth resist, evaporated. </sentence><sentence id="209">Especially we had ______ started to march into the <span class="region">Rhineland</span> (ph) and uh though...we have learned this

id="430">And that was all we knew. </sentence><sentence id="431">Uh so uh a couple of days later uh somehow uh the Nazis thought that it would be right at least to release those people who had been veterans of World War I, and some of them were found walking around in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and uh but they were...there was a terrible, terrible appearance because their heads been shaved. </sentence><sentence id="432">Their...the the Nazis whenever you come to a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, were delivered into a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, the first things they did was shave your hair and their clothing was completely crampled (ph) because it had gone through a so-called disinfection process, so uh...and then one <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> had started somehow to operate again, and one of my leaders of the youth movement had immediately uh started to organize some kind of relief for those people who if they had been taken into custody in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they knew where to go, but many of them had come from <span class="populated place">cities</span> outside of <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="region">northern Germany</span>, from <span class="region">western Germany</span>...those who had not been taken to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> or <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> had come especially from places like <span class="region">west Germany</span> or <span class="region">rural districts</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="433">And we organized...and and he organized this kind of relief action and he called me into that, to uh try to pick up these people who came by <span class="dlf">railway</span> from the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and you could recognize them immediately, and to bring them to the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> where they uh first of all were treated medically. </sentence><sentence id="434">Some of them had terrible wounds because of frostbite and so...give them a decent meal, and especially those who had uh come from other...who originated from <span

it emotionally rewarding, and I said listen, I have here Mr. so and so. </sentence><sentence id="436">He would like to speak to you. </sentence><sentence id="437">And very often you heard on the other side an outcry so so uh this kind of work uh uh became became uh uh took on took on very substantial dimensions because more people then were released, and as I say, I participated in that and to a certain extent also my then wife, because she had also lost her position, and that was nota _, a work from nine to five, and there was...that was not on a salary basis. </sentence><sentence id="438">It was simply...it was just relief work to do what had to be done and also, for instance, to organize that these people could get back...uh had by by by <span class="dlf">railway</span> to their different places. </sentence><sentence id="439">Uh and one of the things they they asked uh time and again when these people came, and said what what what what do you know about about us, what what does the world say? </sentence><sentence id="440">Tell us. </sentence><sentence id="441">Tell me. </sentence><sentence id="442">What does <span class="populated place">London</span> and <span

I...we...none of us, myself couldn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="444">We felt very bad about it, because certainly luckily we had not...I had not been affected. </sentence><sentence id="445">I had avoided the the the the uh the uh this kind of action and uh when they...when these people asked me and said uh fine, you are doing all this work. </sentence><sentence id="446">It's wonderful, but the future is now dark there. </sentence><sentence id="447">I can't... mean I know that that that my <span class="building">business</span> is destroyed or I am not uh entitled to continue in my

was being done. </sentence><sentence id="453">So the only thing we we...I could also say from the information I had that there were demonstrations in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and a big meeting in <span class="building">Madison Square Garden</span>, a tremendous amount of words, uh also but no action. </sentence><sentence id="454">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="455">And uh I felt almost lost when when when these questions...and the people were...felt lost. </sentence><sentence id="456">Certainly they were they were happy to uh to uh be out of the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was...all of them somehow were under shock, because the treatment they had uh experienced in these <span class="populated place">camps</span> was torturous. </sentence><sentence id="458">They told us about the details uh where where in also...I mean I had heard before what what people had been exposed to when they were taken to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> or so but but you know, here you heard it for the first time from people that had just come back (cough) about this this this...the amount of violence to which they had been exposed, so...and the beatings and and standing in in in the cold for hours and hours without...or, for instance, just marching without any sense or or or shoveling uh uh sand from one <span class="spatial object">heap</span> to another and then...I mean without any sense. </sentence><sentence id="459">Uh so uh I see in this respect we all felt lost. </sentence><sentence id="460">I felt lost, and uh there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="461">Even when I discussed it with my wife and my parents, uh there was helplessness, absolute helplessness. </sentence><sentence id="462">And and we we felt lost by the world. </sentence><sentence id="463">Now uh then one evening when I was doing this work, the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said, listen, I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name was the of Jews from <span class="country">Germany</span>, which means the representative of the rights of Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span>...his name was Otto Hirsch (ph). </sentence><sentence id="464">He also had been taken into a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, had just returned and he called me and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is something then very new development. </sentence><sentence id="465">Uh believe it or not, the situation of the Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span>, because <span class="country">Austria</span> was also affected by the November events, it has been discussed in the <span class="building">House of Commons</span> and there is some action under the auspices of the former Prime Minister of of <span class="country">England</span>, Baldwin (ph), and Jewish prominent leaders like uh uh Viscount Samuel (ph) and and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh oppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppressed children so uh uh this is is now to be organized also from here, from <span class="country">Germany</span> and uh Mr. Hirsch said well, we have terrific social workers who gradually were flocking back to the <span class="building">office</span>, you know, in order to do work, but they need technical help and this is something you have to do. </sentence><sentence id="466">And I said to him, Martin, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="467">I I'm in the middle of my preparations. </sentence><sentence id="468">I would like to to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> as soon as possible because we all are in the same situation uh and and and he said yes, but you know that's part of our education. </sentence><sentence id="469">There's a job to be done and uh uh in <span class="country">Germany</span> you would call it ,in other words to do a thing just for the cause and not for the reward. </sentence><sentence id="470">So see...he told me next morning, see uh Otto Hirsch in in in his <span class="building">office</span> and he will tell you all the details, and I came to him. </sentence><sentence id="471">As I say, he was the executive director of all operations, Jewish operations, because we had a centralized uh organization for that. </sentence><sentence id="472">I knew him because he was the father of a friend who was also in our move...youth movement, now living in in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, and he gave me details, telling me that (clearing throat) uh he just had been advised that this is what the British government has agreed to and to...but no special conditions. </sentence><sentence id="473">The only conditions were children have to be healthy, had to go with the permission of the parents because the parents could not accompany This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="474">It is not the primary source, and it has not

restricted to the age of twelve to seventeen because this would be considered the age where they could be...could go without the accompaniment of their parents and and and uh wouldn't create special educational problems. </sentence><sentence id="476">So Otto Hirsch told me uh uh kindly help us, because uh our social workers are very devoted and excellent workers but uh unfortunately they have no experience in technical matters. </sentence><sentence id="477">I said but I have never done something like that. </sentence><sentence id="478">Certainly I have participated in the organization of <span class="populated place">summer camps</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, and and in <span class="country">Sweden</span> and <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">He said still uh kindly help us. </sentence><sentence id="480">I said but don't forget I am in the middle of my preparations also to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>, and he said well, uh I can give you my promise that when this will be done and will be successfully done, it will be our commitment and our obligation to help you and your family to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="481">Well, it's a promise to which he couldn't live up because uh in early in 1941, I think, he was uh taken again into custody, was shipped to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> and murdered there in cold blood. </sentence><sentence id="482">So what I did then was, I went to this <span class="building">office</span> where there was a department for children, immigration which __ had established before because there was a trickle of children uh who had been given the opportunity to go to <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Sweden</span> and and <span class="country">America</span>, within the quota. </sentence><sentence id="483">And uh I came to that <span class="building">office</span> and uh when I saw what was going on, I almost died. </sentence><sentence id="484">I...my stomach turned around, which was certainly can be explained only from the situation we were in. </sentence><sentence id="485">Uh there was a big <span class="interior space">conference room</span> in that uh <span class="building">office</span>, covered with uh cards, heaps of cards and there was a <span class="spatial object">desk</span> which was covered with papers and the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> was constantly ringing and I was given to understand...uh there was a lady who was in charge of it. </sentence><sentence id="486">She had before been uh in high service under the Prussian government, a Jewish lady, uh had been assistant to one of the uh social democratic ministers from <span class="country">Prussia</span>, and uh a trained social worker, and she told me that something has to be done to to organize this properly, and uh after having seen that and having recovered a little bit, the first thing I did was to call in some of my friends, again from the youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="487">We all uh at this time had no...were not gainfully employed in productive work, and all purposes more or less lost our positions and uh the first thing I organized were these cards...these cards were so called...when I asked what is it...these are permits which had come in already from <span class="country">England</span> to give uh children the the permit to come to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">In other words they didn't need passports and so there were special cards worked out with the cooperation of the <span class="building">home office</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, with a picture and so...which had come from <span class="country">England</span> and then the German police had certified the the the uh the names and the age and so on, and these were cards which which gave the young people of that age a license to enter <span class="country">England</span>, so the first thing we did...was I did was, with the help of my friends, to organize these cards in alphabetical order and in geographical order in order to have some kind of a of a of an idea what was what, and then it would give me some some <span class="interior space">working room</span> at the <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and organized the telephone calls to such extent that, you know, when, for instance, it happened a telephone call came from a from a desperate parent from anywhere and said what's about the application of my of my of my child, and then one of these social workers jumped to that <span class="spatial object">table</span> and they they they fished out of the of that mound of of paper the the the permit, because they said yes, I remember it had arrived this morning or yesterday morning. </sentence><sentence id="489">And as I said, there there was disorder but not...but not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="490">It is not the

collection 7 because they wanted but things were...had had had had...were were in a rush and and and and had overwhelmed them, so uh then I found out that we...it was...we...it was organized in such a way that people, that parents were advised in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and the <span class="populated place">Jewish communities</span> outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and also under the rules and regulations, they had set already with the with the...believe it or not by cooperation with the with the Gestapo, under which the the had to work, that uh uh the <span class="populated place">Jewish communities</span>, the the welfare agencies uh and agencies had to select the children, which means that the children...the parents who got a way of assist of this project, made an application to the proper <span class="populated place">Jewish communities</span> and then the social workers, the local social workers, then checked the...if the conditions were right and and then they they made the application. </sentence><sentence id="492">I had nothing to do with that, so what my task was, and I was advised to do that, was to organize the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> so that they could get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">Now also that was not an easy task because we had to live under certain rules and regulations because in order to prepare a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, you had to prepare the proper lists, the records. </sentence><sentence id="494">One copy had to go to the <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="495">One copy had to go <span class="populated place">London</span> in order to advise the people in <span class="populated place">London</span> that the children were coming and whoever were the prospective foster parents or the the <span class="building">hostels</span> which had to be prepared for these people had to be had to be made ready, and all this was done. </sentence><sentence id="496">Certainly there were no <span class="spatial object">faxes</span> and no computer systems and and and when you made...had...the <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> did not uh...there was no push button system. </sentence><sentence id="497">For instance, to make a telephone call to <span class="populated place">London</span> from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> could last hours and hours and even within <span class="country">Germany</span> it was not...you know, it was still in the age of...the the age when most of the work or all the work had to be done manually. </sentence><sentence id="498">So somehow this we got under control and I set up a certain...I can't say I because uh I was then I was made responsible for all technical aspects of these <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, so that means uh first of all to see to it that the that the lists were properly prepared, that the parents were were advised uh when to when to bring their children to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, especially from eastern or northern uh <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="region">middle Germany</span>, because the starting point was <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="499">Then I had to uh approach the <span class="building">railway authorities</span> to give us reserved <span class="spatial object">coaches</span>, because they couldn't travel with the other public. </sentence><sentence id="500">Uh then a special <span class="interior space">room</span> had to be made available as an assembly point in a <span class="building">railway station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="501">The local police had to be advised, because uh certainly all this was done under the supervision of the police authorities. </sentence><sentence id="502">Uh then we had...and I...that was also my responsibility to find escorts. </sentence><sentence id="503">Parents could not go with their children, so we had to find escorts to take them, to take these children, so again there was the the human resource...of of the young people of the of the of the members of the youth movement, irrespective as I say, Zionists, non-Zionists, all this disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="504">And we found wonderful people, teachers and and youth leaders and so who who volunteered for that service. </sentence><sentence id="505">Uh and uh at the beginning we were...it was made clear to us that uh these escorts could only escort the uh the youngsters to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, but there was no chance to take them to <span

take them up to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and they agreed under one condition...that all these escorts uh were to return again to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>.

people came back, especially after the November events, to <span class="country">Germany</span> they were taken immediately into custody and shipped into a <span class="populated place">camp,</span> in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, so in order to protect our escorts, the uh Ministry of the Interior, the Nazi Ministry of the Interior, gave everyone who who was an escort, they call it protection letter which he could use for the <span class="building">border police</span> to say and it said that so and so, in my case Norbert Israel Wolheim, you know that's my name, was was is is traveling in German interests and should be and so uh we had the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> under those conditions ready in January. </sentence><sentence id="510">And I was instrumental in...that was my first responsibility, and uh together with some friends who were also escorts I uh accompanied this <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to the <span class="dlf">border</span> which was uh <span class="populated place">Bentheim</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="511">It was a German...a <span class="dlf">Dutch border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">I also had to inform not only the people in <span class="country">England</span> but people in <span class="country">Holland</span>, Jewish...the uh the uh relief organizations because they wanted to help the children when they were traveling through uh <span class="country">Holland</span> because the technical arrangements were that people...as I said, before came from all kinds...from all <span class="populated place">cities</span>, assembled in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="513">Then from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> the <span class="spatial object">train</span> left, went via <span class="populated place">Hanover</span> to the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="populated

the <span class="spatial object">ferry</span> took these children uh through the <span class="env feature">Channel</span> or via the <span class="env feature">Channel</span> to <span class="populated place">Harwich</span> (ph) in <span class="country">England</span> where they landed in <span class="country">England</span> and they had to undergo immigration uh checks and and customs checks and then the <span class="spatial object">train</span> took us from <span class="populated place">Harwich</span> to <span class="populated place">London</span> where at <span class="building">Liverpool Street Station</span>, the Jewish Committee of of uh of <span class="populated place">London</span> had established their reception <span class="building">center</span> where then the parents and the uh the uh officials came and and and distributed the children. </sentence><sentence id="514">This first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> uh uh still is very vivid in my memory because when we came to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, uh the SS guards who were uh uh doing custom duties and they were not all of them, or none of them was trained in this respect...they ascended the the the uh <span class="spatial object">coaches</span> and they behaved like vandals. </sentence><sentence id="515">They did not attack the children, but they treated the <span class="spatial

and for things like that. </sentence><sentence id="517">Couldn't find a thing, but at least this is what they did, and any attempt to talk to them and so certainly was in vain. </sentence><sentence id="518">And uh then uh it was so bad that they uh separated the <span class="spatial object">coaches</span> with the with the Jewish children from the other <span class="spatial object">train</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> left for <span class="country">Holland</span> and when this <span class="spatial object">train</span> without the children arrived in <span class="country">Holland</span>, the authorities there were waiting and saw the children were not there. </sentence><sentence id="519">And amongst the people who were serving...I mean who were uh the

these children to to to to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="530">Now to select these people was a very uh uh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a chance to go to <span class="country">England</span> certainly looked for a chance, and there were friends or relatives pressing on them and said are you stupid to go back, but this was the condition, and they had...the the Nazis had told us in no uncertain term that if people would not uh obey their order, then these these <span class="spatial object">transports</span> would come to an end and this certainly we could not afford. </sentence><sentence id="531">So as I say, I was very, very careful in the selection of those people and thank God with the exception of one case, it worked. </sentence><sentence id="532">Now we had uh uh uh approximately I think twenty, twenty <span class="spatial object">transports</span> uh which left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">Uh it was my duty to see all of them off, and I was uh uh uh every morning when they came together, I was there to to arrange it, so uh uh whether I went with the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> or not, that was in a in a big <span class="interior space">hall</span> in in in call it <span class="populated

their parents or their relatives and this was then the uh the the moment of their goodbye, so uh there was a problem uh with the first <span class="spatial object">transports</span> which...for which I had not been responsible. </sentence><sentence id="534">A smaller group had left in in in December I think, and the parents had accompanied these children to the to the <span class="spatial

that if this would be repeated, they would control all the all all these arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="535">We were able to convince them that we will take over, that we will see to it that order should prevail and that they shouldn't interfere, that they could be present if they want to, not__ present fine but they shouldn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="536">And I think it worked. </sentence><sentence id="537">So uh when in the morning when when when such a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was due to to leave, as I say, I was there and uh it was a very, very, very...I remember that very distinctly the atmosphere, you know. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was...there was tension in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="539">There was an atmosphere of expectation. </sentence><sentence id="540">There was concern by the parents. </sentence><sentence id="541">There were...there were kiss...there were tears of

were able to to to uh uh to uh have it, to change the departure date from September Ist to August 29, and I decided then uh on account of the situation not to be the leader of that <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: Can you tell us now what happened to you when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1038">A: Well, when the war broke out we uh we uh uh...when I say we I mean it means also myself...lived with the expectation that they might do something, the Nazis, take us into to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> __, being afraid that uh we might endanger the German war efforts, who knows. </sentence><sentence id="1039">All kind of crazy things were possible, but but nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I continued my work uh for the uh <span class="building">central office</span> in in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, for the <span class="building">Central Jewish Office</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, for a certain while. </sentence><sentence id="1041">We had still a couple of small <span class="spatial object">transports</span> going to <span class="country">Denmark</span>, to the __ center, but this fizzled out soon, and then I was asked to take over the administration of the vocational training uh <span class="building">schools</span>, uh the the...this organization uh had set up, especially outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>...carpentry, plumbing, metal work and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1042">These were very good <span class="building">schools</span> uh uh and let...by Jewish and non-Jewish teachers. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Helped very much uh children to acquire vocational training, and so I also had to travel to a certain extent in <span class="country">Germany</span> which was not easy at this time but I still...it was it was possible. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And uh then uh uh in in the summer of "41, uh in the course of the uh events and especially uh after uh uh...after uh <span class="country">Germany</span> was successful in <span class="country">Poland</span> and in <span class="country">France</span> and in in in <span class="country">Norway</span>, and had taken over all these <span class="country">countries</span> and occupied them, uh there started what we called the the final solution also in <span class="country">Germany</span>, especially in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh it's better to stay away from work in the <span class="building">central office</span> because there was nothing we could do any more for our for our Jewish people, and I had the the feeling and I want to be careful in this respect, that we more or less uh would be in the danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than to do what what was necessary to do in the Jewish interest, though I realized fully that all these leaders, devoted men, most of them had become martyrs, tried to do their best to save Jewish lives, but uh uh there was nothing anymore to be done, so I decided to to become separated from the work for the for the rest... call them...of Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> and I uh uh had to uh report to an <span class="building">office</span> which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish workers in in...for forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="1045">In other words, the uh Jews who had lost their jobs and who could not work any more in in in <span class="building">offices</span> and so they were drawn into all kinds of work, digging work, transport work, uh uh <span class="building">factory</span> work, whatever it was, because also on account of the uh disappearing manpower of of <span class="country">Germany</span>, they needed us for this. </sentence><sentence id="1046">That's what we thought. </sentence><sentence id="1047">So uh I was uh uh...I reported that I was a welder, so I was uh then uh sent to a <span class="building">firm</span>, to a <span class="building">German firm</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> uh which had a Jewish group which means at this time uh Jews could not work as individuals. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Jews could only work in groups and the people who had taken on these groups had to provide special facilities, special <span class="spatial object">toilets</span> and so, so that Jews and non-Jews didn't mix. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And uh this group I I joined certainly not voluntarily but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1050">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1051"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 but uh the special problem was that this was a <span class="building">factory</span> which was located in the eastern part of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, uh the <span class="region">northeastern part</span> of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I was living at this time on the <span class="region">west</span> and it was a long way to the <span class="building">factory</span> and I had to get up between four thirty and five o'clock in the morning in order to make it on time. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Uh this was also the time when the first uh air raids started of the British air uh air force against <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, so uh during the so-called alarms, when I was at <span class="building">home</span> we were...had to take shelter in a <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Jews were separated there also from from non-Jews and later we realized that these <span class="interior space">basements</span> certainly didn't give any kind of protection, but this is actually what was done. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But also in that <span class="building">factory</span>, uh Jews were were pressed into service uh for for as...not air raid wardens but uh uh uh a group to uh to uh fight fires or whatever it is if something should happen, so that uh very often I didn't come <span class="building">home</span> uh uh for for almost two days, didn't know what was going on at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Uh in in in November "39, by the way, uh my wife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell that certainly at the beginning of the war, Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or have radio, so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them, so uh so uh uh that means very often, especially after an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid, I didn't know what happened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me, and uh then in the summer of "41, there started what we called the final solution. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Uh we...in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> the head of the Jewish community was called to the Gestapo and he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse me...that for a thousand people uh <span class="interior space">apartments</span> should be made available uh and uh the uh the people should uh should assemble in a <span class="building">synagogue</span> uh and not be accommodated at another place. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Now I think I overlooked one thing, that uh also in September "41 there started...laws were promulgated to force Jews to wear a yellow badge, and from this time on...that was September "41. </sentence><sentence id="1059">By the way, it was also the time when no immigration was possible from <span class="country">Germany</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Even during the war in the first part, there was still certain possibilities to come to <span class="country">America</span> via <span class="country">Portugal</span> or later after the campaign in <span class="country">Poland</span>, via <span class="region">Siberia</span>, by <span class="spatial object">train</span> through , but in September "41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that we tried very hard but the German...the <span class="building">American Consulate</span> uh with which I was registered uh asked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers, our affidavits, but that was not easy to get in <span class="country">America</span> and also the the <span class="building">Consulate</span> stopped very early to process applications. </sentence><sentence id="1061">It also set conditions which were impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1062">More can be read about this in the book of David about the abandonment of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1063">The American bureaucracy at this time was not very helpful to save people it could have saved. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Now uh in connection with the with the promulgation of the laws about the about the yellow badge, there uh other restrictions started. </sentence><sentence id="1065">We were not allowed anymore to uh to use certain <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We were not allowed to uh to uh to buy and to go shopping, only at certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="1067">We certainly...we couldn't see a movie or our <span class="building">theater</span> and uh uh any...we were were also...we had to to place the Star of David at the outside of our of our <span class="dlf">doors</span> in the in the <span class="interior space">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So life became became became more and more uh difficult, almost impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1069">We still tried to uh get to...I, for instance, saw friends if possible and we uh we uh...and my parents lived in the easter part of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and we, as I said before, in the <span class="region">western part</span> and certainly my parents were very much interested and also the parents of my wife, to see our boy but uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1070">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked

use the <span class="spatial object">public transportation</span>, we even walked that way which was two and a half or three hours. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Now at the beginning we did it. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Later we did it under the protection of darkness which was dangerous, uh uh hiding the <span class="spatial object">Star</span> and then at least to give our parents to see to see us and and the boy (clearing throat) because uh uh communications over the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> and so didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Uh in in the course of of of that time, the restrictions became became became became more uh rigid and also then uh to come back to that order to the heads of the Jewish community, not to make room for the people who had to uh make their <span class="building">apartments</span> available, to provide them with other <span class="building">shelter</span>...there started the first deportations to the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Uh we were not fully aware what...and I I uh uh uh tried to get information wherever I could, but uh don't forget that at this time you had no public press anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Uh uh the <span class="spatial object">press</span> was completely controlled. </sentence><sentence id="1077">There were no letters to the editor or free speech or free writing and so and certainly the press did not report about anything like that so it were mostly rumors you had follow in in order to find out what was going on, but the deportations started first with the with the deportations of elderly people who were not uh in the in the...part of the forced labor program, because they considered them as uh as disposable and so <span class="spatial object">transports</span> went to first to to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, or what they called, what they called, the Germans, and other places like <span class="populated place">Riga</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, and some of these <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, as we know from from from information later, never arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I uh uh uh...it's difficult to say how did I react. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I know we were exposed to a <span class="building">development</span> over which we had no control. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I realized that uh all my attempts to save myself and my family, or to save my family and myself had been in vain and, therefore, we we had to take whatever, whatever...I can...only had to hope that uh the military operations would result in a defeat of <span class="country">Germany</span> and that only in the course of that defeat we could hope to be free again, so that means all our...it was my thinking about survival was to see that that uh <span class="country">Germany</span> was defeated. </sentence><sentence id="1081">Uh certainly there were, especially at the beginning, uh many of our friends and somehow we still tried to meet and exchange uh information about the military situation and so we were convinced that <span class="country">Germany</span> was invincible, and there was not only of...then when you read today the the reports which came out from the father of of Joe Kennedy, he also thought more or less that uh uh uh the <span class="region">western world</span> is...and <span class="country">Russia</span> is defeated and that uh <span class="country">Germany</span> will be will be victorious. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Uh but we uh...I pers....personally must say uh I was a great believer in in in whatever Churchill said. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Not whatever, but but his way of of telling the the people, you know, we will we will never surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1084">We will fight at the <span class="env feature">beaches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1085">We will fight wherever we...we will never surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1086">This gave me hope. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Also my expectation that one day uh public opinion in in <span class="country">America</span>, which was rather isolationist, might change and become aware that <span class="country">Germany</span> is not only a danger for Europe but also for for for <span class="country">America</span> in the long run, so uh and also that that especially after <span class="country">Germany</span> uh attacked <span class="country">Russia</span>, that there was a certain parallel for anybody who knew history, that when Napoleon tried to uh to uh to fight <span class="country">Russia</span>, that was end of his of his Empire, so I I was convinced that uh in spite of all the the military might <span class="country">Germany</span> had developed, that uh uh it could not last. </sentence><sentence id="1088">The question only was how long? </sentence><sentence id="1089">And in this respect also I...how did did I know. </sentence><sentence id="1090">We were

gang, if I may call it, and uh the attacks by the air force became stronger after Hitler had proclaimed and___ had proclaimed already that the British were defeated. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It gave me no hope, and my wife also the same way, that in the long run uh uh uh there must come a turn, and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh changed the whole situation by the defeat of Rommel in <span class="country">Africa</span> and especially after the defeat of <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1098">Uh this gave me a tremendous hope and gave all of us a tremendous hope, but this was a time already when one <span class="spatial object">transport</span> after the other left, for instance, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and the question was how long will it...when when when will when will the sword come down on us. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Uh I had uh uh in this <span class="building">labor gang</span> in which...where we were working, there was one member, a Jewish fellow who worked with us, who was uh what we called a privileged Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1100">That means he didn't have to carry the the yellow badge, the Star of David, because he was married to a non-Jewess and their children were educated as as uh Christians, so he had still the right to uh to keep a radio, and with him we could arrange...I say with him, with some friends in that labor gang, that during the night he should get up and certainly that was something which was uh...the threat of death penalty if he would be caught...to listen to <span class="building">BBC London</span> and and and to the German service to find out what the situation was. </sentence><sentence id="1101">He did it under the condition that we would provide him in the <span class="building">black market</span> with with coffee because he said when he had to get up during the night and he couldn't find sleep immediately, in the morning he was dead tired so he needs real coffee in order to survive the day. </sentence><sentence id="1102">This we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And I I...I said I was one of them who was instrumental in this, so every morning when we came, he whispered to us what he had heard during the night, and in this respect uh we, or I was fully familiar with the progress of uh the Russian army in <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> and of the other defeat of the 6th German army under __in <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> and especially when when when it came to an end with the with the loss of approximately three hundred thousand German soldiers, so the question came, how long will they be able? </sentence><sentence id="1104">Would that mean the end of it and how fast would would the end came. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Uh but uh uh on the other hand, uh the the the Nazis, in spite of of uh these military developments, continued with their deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1106">In December 1942, my parents were deported. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Uh I was...on the way <span class="building">home</span> I tried to to see them. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Then I was told that uh uh the Gestapo had come, had taken them on short notice.

will try to to to hold out. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And and and uh uh though we we have no means to communicate with the outside world, with relatives and friends left in the <span

tell the tale, to tell our story later. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Still we didn't know at this time about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, so when I came to the <span

almost...uh it didn't sink in immediately, that this...that I would never see them again, and that this this was the last... when they were when they were taken away, we couldn't manage to see them in the old age <span class="building">home</span>, because this was closely guarded by the by the SS, so uh it didn't occur to me immediately, but certainly it affected me, but I said to myself I do not like to to that this bad news, the terrible news should overcome you or should should should paralyze me. </sentence><sentence id="1200">I would like...I would I would try whatever I can to survive, to survive this monster, and uh uh I think this is the spirit which which certainly I've tried to carry forward and also later, so uh when when...that was in December uh and then I think it was early in February, after the defeat in in in <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span>, made a speech to which I listened inofficially, because as I told you, we were one of the last to have a <span

has come for the totalitarian...total war and uh the time has come also to uh to uh uh make a final uh...to to get even with the with the domestic enemy, with the internal enemy, and he used a certain expression which is , which means now uh people arise and storm uh uh uh...start in other words to uh to uh...like like uh I think it was as a parallel in history like uh in <span class="populated

information only said that there is a turn, but but we came to the conclusion (clearing throat) for the Jewish situation in <span class="country">Germany</span>, it anyhow might come too late. </sentence><sentence id="1210">And uh uh then in in uh at the end of February, early in March, uh from one day to the other, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was was...there there

for one reason or the other had been advised the night before...said stay <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1213">You never know what's going on, and I was staying <span

id="1218">You just have to to wait and see. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So I tried to read and to to to to even write a letter to a friend in <span class="country">Sweden</span>, because with <span class="country">Sweden</span> there was still...since it was neutral uh you could have still uh an exchange of letters though it was censored, so uh uh and then uh uh in the afternoon of that day, two uh uh policemen who were members of the Gestapo came and told us that uh uh we we are under custody and we uh we uh in ten minutes we should leave. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Now in connection with all these <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, my then wife uh had prepared a knapsack with all kinds of things we thought would be helpful when we would go to the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1221">And uh as I say in that afternoon they came, and gave us ten minutes and my son was sleeping, so we managed somehow to...we all, after all, spoke the same language, to tell them after all we have to get him ready and should give us some time and uh with some hesitation they said alright, we'll wait. </sentence><sentence id="1222">To talk to them was almost impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Uh uh I tried but uh I knew it was dangerous because for these were people who were fanatic Nazis and and and they took...uh take out their wrath against you on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1224">They had the right to kill you on the spot and nobody...nobody would would take them uh to <span class="building">court</span> for that.

were...when we were ascended this <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and saw other Jewish people because they all had the star and they all had the same destiny that their husbands had been

</sentence><sentence id="1229">Those they didn't found in the <span class="building">factories</span>, they found at <span class="building">home</span> and then we were cruising around in in in in

place in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Don't forget that <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was completely blacked out on account of the air raid sit...of the air

something because we had uh red arm bands to help uh to to be...to bring some food to a place, but that was only very minor. </sentence><sentence id="1240">There was nothing...nothing really where you could say uh you can help people. </sentence><sentence id="1241">We were all exposed to the same...to the same danger. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So uh uh and then uh uh again we were we were

where they would hit and what would be hit, and we were part of that, but when the <span class="spatial object">American bombers</span> came, I mean there was...there for the first time I realized that was a massive attack and you'll see when we when we uh looked around that <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was really burning, and we had to hope that the <span class="dlf">railway</span> uh uh would be destroyed, but that didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And then on the 11...uh March 11th we were made part of of that <span class="spatial

I, in spite of that, and also my then wife, had a feeling well, we'll take it...we can take it, because none of us uh was aware what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Uh we didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Uh I only noticed on my watch that exactly at four o'clock in the afternoon this <span class="spatial object">train</span> left and was moving east, because I was familiar with the geography of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span>, so we know we were were uh going to the east, and uh as a matter of fact, uh since we were together with other other friends, in order to to not kill times but to somehow alleviate the situation within ourselves somehow started to sing Jewish songs we had uh learned uh uh in the in the youth movement. . </sentence><sentence id="1253">How nice is it to to be with friends, under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1254">It's absurd today, you know,

you know, what...how how absurd life can be that, you know, here there was a group, just a <span class="spatial object">death wagon</span> of a hundred people, most probably ninety percent of them did not live to see the next evening anymore, but still riding in that <span class="spatial object">car</span>, they were blessing God and welcoming uh the Sabbath, in that mobile uh <span class="building">prison</span> going from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to we still didn't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1258">So we traveled all night and uh then I realized in the morning that we were going via <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> (ph) in this <span class="region">area</span> and uh uh came to <span class="region">Upper Salasia</span> and uh then uh in the afternoon, almost twenty-four hours later, we uh we stopped in a kind of a <span class="building">railway station</span> uh and there I saw for the first time written the name <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I was not aware what <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was in spite of the fact that I had uh uh listened to to to <span class="building">BBC London</span>, had tried to get all the information I could in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1260">We knew about uh <span

we were all somehow stiff and so it was a cold night and so and so, but we were driven out. </sentence><sentence id="1266">There were...there were SS guards with the with the uh uh uh sticks and uh yelling like animals, and uh beating people out of the <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Uh there I also saw when we left our uh <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> that two of our people who were with us or three had committed suicide, so uh uh because they probably...it was it was too much for them, and then outside we were we were assembled on a <span class="dlf">platform</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Uh we were ordered to leave all our uh belongings there, all our knapsacks we had prepared carefully and whatever it was remained there, and then they ordered us to uh line up in different groups, men, uh women with children, and women. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And this was the moment when when when I was separated from my wife and my child, and this is where my wife then said well, this is the moment I have...I was...I will be...I was afraid of. </sentence><sentence id="1270">As long as we were together...and sure enough uh uh this was the last uh uh day I have seen her and my child. </sentence><sentence id="1271">We were lining up and uh uh there stand a man in a in a very elegant SS uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Later I came to understand it was Dr. Mengele, and uh when he approached he asked only how old are you, what's your profession, and then he directed people to the left or to the right with his thumb. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And he asked me how old. </sentence><sentence id="1274">What's your profession? </sentence><sentence id="1275">I certainly did

also prepare...behaved like animals, and they uh uh uh were especially busy with the women with children and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw people in in a certain uniform I had never seen before, with stripped clothing and peculiar kind of a of a of a cap, and uh so then <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> uh were were driving up and one group of people, especially the women with children and the elderly were put on one <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and we still had to wait and uh then this <span class="spatial object">truck</span> left and it so happened that my wife and my my my son had...they were sitting or were standing at the end of that <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and my wife was somehow waving to me. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And

was worse than sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Uh and there certainly everywhere were SS guards. </sentence><sentence id="1283">We tried to uh to uh to uh speak to them, but interesting enough they hardly spoke German because they were what they called which means ethnic Germans, but their main major language was Polish, but they had volunteered obviously for the SS and did this kind of duty. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So we couldn't find out anything from them and then we were driven away from that <span class="building">railway station</span> and passed by a tremendous uh uh <span class="region">area</span> of <span class="building">industrial buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I don't know how many <span class="building">buildings</span> we could see that

a <span class="populated place">camp</span> surrounded by by <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, with <span class="building">watch towers</span> and SS guards with machine uh guns, machine pistols, and when we drove into this I said to my friends who were standing next to me from the youth movement and luckily we were still sticking together... may God help us to get out of here alive. </sentence><sentence id="1289">So uh that's the moment when when we had arrived and I had arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1290">What happened to my wife and my son I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="1291">The others didn't know what happened to their people, so and then we were ordered uh to descent this <span class="spatial

belts and uh then the SS ordered us to take off our rings, our watches, whatever...and uh uh then we were were...I together with these other people and we were approximately I would say two hundred people in this in this group, from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>...uh were were led into a <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1292">We were not quite clear what what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1293">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1294">It was miserable but even later when we...when the <span class="env feature">water</span> came down although it was cold it was somehow, it was...believe it or not some kind of a relief after this trip that we hadn't eaten. </sentence><sentence id="1295">We had not...we were not in in very good

you might be be be called to give evidence about that, so somehow I I tried and not to forget and uh then we...after that...in that...then we were in that <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1297">A man came also with a uniform, with a stripped uniform, and we asked him who are you and he said I'm from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>.

</sentence><sentence id="1483">I only later I found this one of the <span class="spatial object">kommands</span> to uh to wear us down, to grind us down, uh which we called , the the killing...killing kommando, the murder kommando, uh number four. </sentence><sentence id="1484">So then we uh we we we we walked out, again in military order, uh always five because that was easier to count. </sentence><sentence id="1485">We were counted at the uh <span class="dlf">square</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="1486">We were counted when we marched out and at this time the SS uh uh guards were walking with us left and right, so uh in other words each kommando had so and so many SS guards attached to them, and uh it was quite a....quite a distance we walked and uh...well, I was still able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Of course I had still a certain strength in me, and then uh uh then we were...we entered the <span class="region">factory area</span> where where you

for the first time I became acquainted with an <span class="building">institution</span> I didn't know uh uh before, that each kommando had a a a inmate leader called kapo. </sentence><sentence

enough and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And uh I remember that on that first day uh when we were when we were doing this kind of work and I had done part of it in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> so it was not completely new to me...I I saw that one Jewish fellow of another kommando uh throw himself in front of a <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> of a small uh <span class="spatial object">engine</span> to commit suicide so that was the first that I 1 saw there uh and it was the first which was followed by many many more. </sentence><sentence id="1500">So uh when it came to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break, some <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came with some watery soup which was called buna (ph) soup because the name of that <span class="building">factory</span> was <span class="populated place">Buna</span> and it was provided by the firm which they think was a tremendous uh tremendous gain for us. </sentence><sentence id="1501">It was very often absolutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing but just <span class="env feature">water</span> uh uh with some some vegetable remnants or so. </sentence><sentence id="1502">It's awful. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And so uh and since...and also we had...there was...yeah...one of our possessions was uh a <span class="spatial object">bowl</span> which you always had to carry with us. </sentence><sentence id="1504">That was your only possession and a spoon. </sentence><sentence id="1505">When we we got the soup, we couldn't sit down and so it all has to be...had to eaten standing up and then after a short while the the work continued up to the very end of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1506">So at the beginning...I mean it was hard but but but I also considered bearable, but then, you know, not a couple of days later...was early in March, uh terrible rain storms hit the <span class="region">area</span> and the <span class="region">area</span> became muddier than before so the work became more difficult, especially when you have to carry these cement bags. </sentence><sentence id="1507">That was not...the paper was not of the best quality so they very often broke and when you mix cement with water, you know, it it becomes very hard caked and it was setting also on your clothing and so...now the other problem was that I couldn't change...change the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1508">II L...there was no way to clean yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1509">There was so-called <span class="interior space">washroom</span> but the <span class="interior space">washroom</span> was there for hundreds of people. </sentence><sentence id="1510">To get to the <span class="spatial object">faucets</span> was almost impossible, so to keep clean was one of the most difficult things, and also there was always the danger uh that you you would acquire lice which then would would uh result in typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1511">So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that was one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb anymore because you had no hair, but you even didn't also didn't have a towel. </sentence><sentence id="1512">You had...really you had practically...you were devoid of any things uh uh which makes fundamentals of of life. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Who speaks about about books and paper and and...it didn't exist, simply did not exist. </sentence><sentence id="1514">You were really uh a slave. </sentence><sentence id="1515">You were

allowed to live only as long as I as I was able to do this kind of work. </sentence><sentence id="1517">The moment I became weak or the moment I would I would uh contract any any illnesses and so that was the end, so therefore I I also tried very hard to uh to keep myself clean but, of course, I mean especially when you had these rains and you came back in the evening and the the uh the uh so-called uniform was was covered with with the cement dust. </sentence><sentence id="1518">You went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and you were you were wet. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1521">Uh many of our people...I wouldn't say many...some of our people simply said enough is enough and uh I remember distinctly that that uh uh starting the third or fourth

were still in that same kommando, simply when we were walking out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, ran what they called _ so the person had ran away, tried to ran away and then the SS started to shoot immediately and shooting him to death. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Uh and the SS loved to do that because for any for any victim I think they were paid at this time twenty or twenty-five marks and a bottle of of of cognac and so on and a day or two of rest. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And I remember for instance we were walking uh one one morning. </sentence><sentence id="1526">It was the fourth or fifth morning. </sentence><sentence id="1527">A father was walking with his son and the father then when we were out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, gave the rest of his bread and whatever he had to his son and said uh uh I don't need it any more, gave it to his son, ran out in order to be shot, in the presence of his son. </sentence><sentence id="1528">And uh uh uh this I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1529">These first days uh especially became the the worst I would say in my life and very often when we came <span class="building">home</span>, you know, we...after you came back from the <span class="building">factory</span>, you were counted again. </sentence><sentence id="1530">You were counted when you entered the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1531">You were counted again in the evening, and uh this sometimes could last uh hours and hours because <span class="country">Germany</span> was the place where where let us say where where scientists work on mathematics and make progress, but these people were not good in math, and very often when the when the when the numbers didn't didn't didn't jive, we had to wait and and and and they did not uh let us uh let us go before everything was was just just right to the last man, so it happened, for instance, I remember that one evening of the fourth or the fifth, one of the men of my <span class="spatial object">transport</span> just collapsed in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1532">Uh we he was a cantor, a man I knew well because I had attended his service. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Weisman (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1534">A wonderful, powerful voice, and and and and well, highly-educated man. </sentence><sentence id="1535">He collapsed and when the appell was taken and the SS man came and kicked him with his with his foot and he could hardly move and uh then when the appell was...when the roll call was over, uh we decided we had to take him to the so-called uh emergency..the <span class="populated place">krackenbaugh</span>, the <span class="building">hospital</span> and uh it was not easy for us to carry him but we did it because we thought it's the only way to help him, and then on the way, which was quite a long way over there at the end of the uh place, he expired and he died in our hands and uh uh this was, I must say, the first uh casualty I witnessed of somebody I knew well, and then from this day on, many many things happened because the resistance, the power of resistance somehow evaporated. </sentence><sentence id="1536">How I did it I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1537">I 1 thought out all kind... I also felt that I I became weaker. </sentence><sentence id="1538">As a matter of fact, one morning I fainted and my good friends uh lifted me up and the whole day was difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Uh but I somehow managed. </sentence><sentence id="1540">It was one of these miracles, but uh but uh uh after one month I would say, from the two hundred and twenty or so we had been when we were newcomers, only I think a hundred and fifty had survived, but to save the other's place, later, after liberation when I tried to find out how many of our <span class="spatial object">transport</span> had survived, of the thousand who had left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, not more than six, and I am one of those. </sentence><sentence id="1541">So uh uh I myself asked the question, how long would I be able to to to tolerate that and uh also uh we were cut off. </sentence><sentence id="1542">We didn't know what what was the latest on the front. </sentence><sentence id="1543">We were waiting for the second <span class="dlf">front</span> and didn't know any...hear anything because we were cut off from any news. </sentence><sentence id="1544">We didn't hear anything about uh what was going on on the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, so I said how long can it last. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And I remember that one moment then when I went to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, I found a piece of newspaper that probably an SS man had left there, and it so happened that I took into

and, you know, we had to be careful to to to handle this and it so happened when I was in the <span class="dlf">block</span> with my friends I said watch that somebody should discover us and uh I read it and it so happened that was a piece with the report of the of the German Wiermacht saying that they had been driven out of <span class="populated place">Krackow</span> (ph) which gave me an idea that the <span class="dlf">front</span>, the <span class="region">Russian front</span>, was advancing, but more I didn't know, but somehow it it added again, you know, to the spark of life and uh then uh there was another day when I almost lost uh my my my uh belief that I would be able to make it. </sentence><sentence id="1548">In our group was a man who uh uh was very active also in our youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="1549">He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil employee, and he was a man with a beautiful voice. </sentence><sentence id="1550">He had studied music because he wanted to become a cantor, and he had been in another <span class="building">kommando</span> and uh I met him and he was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="1551">I said to him uh...his name was Fritz Shafer (ph)...uh what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1552">He said I've had enough. </sentence><sentence id="1553">I can't take it any longer. </sentence><sentence id="1554">I said what are you going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1555">He said I have uh...I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1556">I went to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1557">After three days they threw me out. </sentence><sentence id="1558">I can hardly stand on my feet and I don't like to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rather take my own life, so I argued with him.

id="1565">He said, this is my decision. </sentence><sentence id="1566">I don't want to be to be to be kicked to death, because what happened here...for this there is no provision in the bible and in in our scriptures, and the next day I heard in the morning whatever shooting going on during the night. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Very often the SS guards on the <span class="building">tower</span>, they were sometimes shooting because...to keep themselves awake let us say, and they could order you...they had these Jews that they saw something in there for the...it was suspicious and therefore they were firing, so uh so we heard shooting constantly, and next day somebody said you know, did you hear the shooting this morning. </sentence><sentence id="1568">I said yes, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1569">They said your friend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he tried to be admitted to the to the <span class="building">hospital</span> again.

</sentence><sentence id="1571">They went to the to the <span class="dlf">wire</span> and then the fellow from the the gangster from the...the SS gangster from the <span class="building">watch tower</span> was shooting because that was his order, so he went to the <span class="dlf">wire</span> in order to be shot and and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And I remember it still...it was on April 3rd, 1940..."43, soon after we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1573">Uh so when I heard this, I must say I 1 1 1 was almost lost because I had lost a battle and I saw the parallel and I was uh said...asking myself how long will we all be able to make that, and then uh one day or two days later, all of a sudden there was uh uh a special roll call that people should register again their their their uh profession, so that gave me another hope and uh there was what they called the labor service, . </sentence><sentence id="1574">Again registered and I registered myself again as welder. </sentence><sentence id="1575">The uh reason was that the Germans had lost on account of <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> a lot of manpower, had uh uh inducted

registered. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Nothing came out of it but somehow it gave me some hope, and there was another event which uh was of immense importance. </sentence><sentence id="1578">All

wanted to go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and so you had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap and asking for permission, for his permission and so on and what they did in order to play around was very often to take, when you when you take off your cap, take the cap and throw it away and when the moment when you...when the people went to get, to collect the cap, then the SS man was shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and this this was the uh the situation the first couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1583">Also in connection with the <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> defeat uh they then came to the conclusion that they wanted to save manpower and they organized the uh the uh guards in such a way that they were surrounding completely the whole <span class="region">area</span> of that <span class="building">industrial complex</span>, so that when we marched out, when we got into into into the <span class="region">factory area</span>, the SS stayed outside uh keeping guard out...yeah, keeping guard outside but we marched in only with the <span class="spatial

with their own people...they were mostly German criminals and and anti-social elements and so they then were not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become tougher with the...so this helped somehow, but still it was no no no no solution and and as I say, I 1 11 thought what what...still I was able to move but but I said something has to had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1585">For instance, we were then...I was put in another kommando under the command of a kapo who was a Polish criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1586">He had committed one or two murders uh and and he was such a human being the only regret he had that he had waited too long to murder his wife and his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was taking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for one reason or the other because uh...so uh he was a kapo there and he had uh used the foul language especially in Polish, because he was also was also one of these ethnic Germans who didn't know exactly where they belonged. </sentence><sentence id="1587">You know, they they they they they had a double standard. </sentence><sentence id="1588">They wanted to be Germans, and at the same time uh uh they wanted to to remain with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head of a digging kommando, and that was also that was that that uh he was called in a German expression was Juden Franz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1589">Franz is a German name, but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he got because he was a grinder of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1590">He had shown so many Jewish uh casualties on his conscious. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And he would always say, well I had to do it in order to enforce the _, and we were not protected. </sentence><sentence id="1592">There was no protected because not only had I lost my my my name and my hair and my clothing and my family...I also had had lost completely my my right to claim any human rights. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And uh that's what certainly these these people, these gangsters knew very well that there was no protection and uh then one day uh the uh the uh...we were called again to the <span class="building">labor

said welder. </sentence><sentence id="1594">He was somehow doubtful, for what reasons, but uh then he asked me certain technical questions and I was able to answer them, and then uh uh two days later I was transferred into a <span class="building">kommando</span> where I I got out of this grinding work of <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, digging, and all this and uh was attached to

id="1754">That was dangerous for the Germans, for the <span class="populated place">German state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1755">Uh I sharpened part of that of that <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="1756">Uh because I realized that the moment I would give in, that could be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I was working for that first German meister, uh uh who was

him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness, he treated me like an equal. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And when he saw that I made progress in whatever he wanted me to do, then he gave me some cigarettes uh which I didn't use certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes for bread which was very important, also to to get up some more energy. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And uh uh so uh also what was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I worked with him I could work under a <span class="dlf">roof</span> so that the elements...I was not exposed to the elements.
