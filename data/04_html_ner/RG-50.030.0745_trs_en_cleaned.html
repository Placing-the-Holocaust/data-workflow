<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: That first day, no. </sentence><sentence id="475">I didn't lose any men, but in subsequent following men, I did lose some men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="478">Q: That must have been extraordinarily difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: It was because they were men that I had trained with some back in the <span class="country">states</span>, and some in through my period in <span class="country">England</span>, and during this period of time, you become close to your men and almost like family. </sentence><sentence id="481">And, you know, it hurts when you see a man get wounded or killed, and you feel a partially responsible for it--although it's not your fault-- you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: You described just now as rather like being a family. </sentence><sentence id="485">As a platoon leader, did you look at the men under your command, were they more like sons to you or more like brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: more like sons because, as I mentioned, when I landed there, I was 27 years old on my birthday, and most of my men were 18, 19, 20 years old, what I call kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: So there was a little bit of a <span class="dlf">gap</span> there, and I felt more or less they were my sons that I had to take care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="495">What did you think of--you said before going into combat you had that attitude that. </sentence><sentence id="496">You were going to go in and show these guys the what for. </sentence><sentence id="497">Once you had that experience of close combat, what did you think about the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="498">Were they good soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: We found that--we really learned that they were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, and they had weapons that were as good as or better than what we had. </sentence><sentence id="505">And the only way we gained the upper hand was the fact that we just had more men. </sentence><sentence id="506">We had more weapons, more <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and we just overpowered them by sheer numbers rather than technical better weapons. </sentence><sentence id="507">They had better weapons than we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: Well, they were good. </sentence><sentence id="521">The most of them, the Wehrmachts, were very good soldiers, well disciplined. </sentence><sentence id="522">One of the big differences that we found is that they went strictly by the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="523">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="524"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection book. </sentence><sentence id="525">Whatever was in the training manuals, whatever their leaders told them to do, that's what they did, nothing more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: But with the American soldiers, we adapted. </sentence><sentence id="537">We were told what to do and how to do it, but if that didn't work, then we had the liberty of doing something else that would work, and we had that flexibility which the Germans did not have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="540">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="541">Now, as you're moving <span class="region">inland</span>, moving deeper and deeper into <span class="country">France</span>, at some point you came into contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="542">Can you tell us about that first experience with Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="548">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="551">We did not have any contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="552">Now, let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="553">Back in the early training days. </sentence><sentence id="554">Occasionally, we would hear or read in the newspapers about some Jews being tortured in <span class="country">Europe</span>, slave laborers, and this periodically would appear, but we never pay much attention to it because what we were hearing was that some Jew would escape from some <span class="populated place">camp</span>--we didn't know about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> back in those days. </sentence><sentence id="555">We heard there were these <span class="populated place">camps</span> where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor, but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, went back to his <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and told the people about what was going on in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>--that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="556">They wouldn't--they did not believe him. </sentence><sentence id="557">The Jewish congregation in his <span class="populated place">town</span> did not believe him because, like us, we thought of the German people as being civilized human beings, inelegant people, and they would not do that to another segment of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="558">So this went on, periodically, we would read articles like this while we were in <span class="country">England</span>, but when we got into <span class="country">France</span>, we saw none of that. </sentence><sentence id="559">In fact, Jews didn't even cross our mind. </sentence><sentence id="560">That was not why we were there. </sentence><sentence id="561">We weren't there to liberate to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="562">We didn't know about that whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="563">We were there to drive the Germans out of the <span class="region">land</span> which they had occupied illegally. </sentence><sentence id="564">So we were not concerned with Jews, and we never really saw any Jews because the Germans had taken them all out of <span class="country">France</span> back to <span class="country">Germany</span> to use them as slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="565">So as we proceeded through <span class="populated place">Normandy</span> and <span class="region">Northern France</span> and into <span class="country">Belgium</span>, we did never saw or had any contact with any Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="620">So we were just chasing them. </sentence><sentence id="621">They were doing what we call--I forgot what it is now--sort of defensive action as they were retreating, and the major part of the German army was moving back eastward toward <span class="country">Germany</span>, and they would leave a small segment of men behind to delay us, to create delaying actions. </sentence><sentence id="622">And that's all we did all the way across <span class="region">northern France</span> and up into <span class="country">Belgium</span> and <span class="country">Holland</span> and not until we got into <span class="country">Holland</span> and the <span class="dlf">German border</span> where they had the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">That's where we had to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason that we stopped there was that we had run across <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Belgium</span> and <span class="country">Holland</span> so fast, we had outrun our <span class="dlf">supply lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">Now, all of our supplies had to come across <span class="country">England</span>, across the <span class="dlf">channel</span> into <span class="populated place">Omaha Beach</span>, and by <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, move them up daily to supply us with food, ammunition, clothing, replacements. </sentence><sentence id="625">So it was kind of a slow process, and we were moving faster than the <span class="dlf">supply lines</span> could keep up with us. </sentence><sentence id="626">So by the time we got to <span class="country">Holland</span> and the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span>, we had left thousands of <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> behind because we ran out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="627">We just dropped the <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> off at the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and abandoned them more or less. </sentence><sentence id="628">So by the time we got to <span class="country">Holland</span>, we were out of food, we were out of ammunition, we were out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="629">So we had to stop there nearly a month waiting for supplies to reach us and become resupplied with ammunition, with food, replacement men before we could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="630">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="631"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection make a successful attack on the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span>, and once we got the momentum going, to keep on going. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="869">A: That they were brought in there and administered help to them, and this was where I got assigned a job of moving these people away from this point in <span class="populated place">Farsleben</span> because actually this was still a <span class="region">battle zone</span>, and we had American artillery falling in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="870">We had <span class="spatial object">German artillery</span> falling in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="871">So we didn't want to have anymore casualties. </sentence><sentence id="872">So I was delegated then to round up <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> and take these people out of there to this <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Hillersleben</span> that we had liberated a couple of days before where there was a <span class="building">barracks</span> and a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="873">So I rounded up about 60 or 70 <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> and got them loaded up and got them out of the <span class="region">area</span> back to <span class="populated place">Hillersleben</span>. </sentence><sentence id="874">And of course, the medical corps went with them, and they put the sick people in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, and the others went into the <span class="building">barracks</span>, but first of all, as soon as we brought them back to <span class="populated place">Hillersleben</span>, they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing, so we had to have them strip their clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up some <span class="dlf">shower points</span>, and we started moving them through the <span class="spatial object">showers</span>--the first shower that they had had in months and years. </sentence><sentence id="875">And as soon as they got through the <span class="interior space">shower</span>, of course, they were given towels and soap, and they were so happy to get cleaned up to little bit, but even through the <span class="spatial object">shower</span>, they could not get rid of the lice that were infested in their hair and in their pubic hairs. </sentence><sentence id="876">And so after they finished the <span class="interior space">shower</span>, we dusted them with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="877">Now, DDT is today a prohibited item because it's a carcinoginious[sic] item and is, by law, is prohibited for use. </sentence><sentence id="878">But at that time that was the best technology that we had to fight lice and fleas any kind of insect that they might have. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: It worked. </sentence><sentence id="892">So then we had the German people were ordered to bring clothing to this point and of course they were reclothed, and then the single people were put in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="893">The married people were put in to some of the <span class="building">private homes</span> that were available. </sentence><sentence id="894">And at this point, I left them. </sentence><sentence id="895">They went back to my <span class="building">unit</span> and continued on my job, and we fought or way onto <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> and we attacked, captured <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> on the 18th of April, and as far as we were concerned, that was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="896">Because the <span class="env feature">Elm River</span> which ran through <span class="populated place">Magdeburg</span> was the <span class="dlf">demarcation line</span> between us and the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="897">We could not go beyond that <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="898">So we stopped fighting on the 18th of April, and just sat there and wait for the Russians to come in front of us and move on into <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="899">But basically that was the end of the war, and that was the first and only contact that we had ever had with any Jews, this group of the 2,500 on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="901">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="902"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And of course, in talking with some of them, we found out where they came from, and that they had been incarcerated at <span class="populated place">BergenBelsen</span>, and they told us a story about their life in <span class="populated place">BergenBelsen</span> and them being put on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and then we captured them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="939">A: Well, we weren't--as we were fighting across <span class="country">Europe</span>, we weren't fighting to save any Jews. </sentence><sentence id="940">We didn't know about them. </sentence><sentence id="941">We were fighting to drive the Germans back out of these occupied countries, to give these people in <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, and <span class="country">Holland</span>--to give their freedom and liberty back that they had had back in 1940 when they were invaded by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="942">The Jewish situation was just sort of a sideline that happened that we didn't know anything about. </sentence><sentence id="943">We didn't know what was going on until we saw, and then we believed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: Well, basically at that point in time, it was too late because here we are at the end of the war now. </sentence><sentence id="952">So from that point on, we didn't have much contact with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="953">The war was over. </sentence><sentence id="954">| think it was the 8th of May; so it was only about three weeks after we found this <span class="spatial object">train</span> that the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="955">Of course, we didn't have any good feelings toward This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="956">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="957"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the Germans because they were denying everything, and we knew that they were lying, that they were involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="958">They knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="959">They knew what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
