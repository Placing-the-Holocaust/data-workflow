<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="99">So then it was in that year that your father became one of Jehovah's Witnesses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="103">And he got a assignment in, uh, vicinity for about, uh, sixty kilometers, right up to the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">You know, to call on people. </sentence><sentence id="105">And one of the next one what showed interest and became a Witness was, uh, a neighbor, Hans [NB: Johann] Stossier--which, uh, sister I later married, because she became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, too. </sentence><sentence id="106">And he helped him to preach in that big <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">He had sometime walk up to eight hours in one direction, because he was not able to pay the <span class="spatial object">train</span> fare to those <span class="region">outlying areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">And so a congregation was formed of about, uh, twenty-four, until, uh, Hitler came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: So what began to happen then to your...your family, to your congregation then, in "33 to "38? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: In the beginning, when in <span class="country">Austria</span> the dictator government was established under, uh, Dollfuss." </sentence><sentence id="119">He was then in "34 assassinated, and followed by Chancellor Schuschnigg." </sentence><sentence id="120">And uh, about, uh, 1936, in, uh, February, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was banned. </sentence><sentence id="121">And my father was already jailed at that time under the peddling laws--peddling without a license. </sentence><sentence id="122">So he couldn't pay the fine; so he was then jailed for some days, just by preaching, uh, the good news. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: You mean, he was accused of peddling? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: For what reason? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: With literatures, that it was required--this was just the excuse--uh, he would need a license. </sentence><sentence id="133">For that reason. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: And then things developed, uh, uh, towards "<span class="populated place">38</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">There were quite some difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, also with this movement already, some Nazis started preparing; and there was the talk of a takeover of <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">In that time, I start apprentice-time for painting; and it was even noticeable in that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">We were forced to obtain religious instruction. </sentence><sentence id="143">And when a priest came in, uh, there was some apprentice what were already over twenty before they got a job. </sentence><sentence id="144">And so they objected to the teaching and, uh, presence of the priest. </sentence><sentence id="145">And some in the background even hailed Hitler in his presence. </sentence><sentence id="146">He was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="147">And then the priest said, "What's wrong with our religion? </sentence><sentence id="148">You have no respect! </sentence><sentence id="149">Ask me questions." </sentence><sentence id="150">And so nobody, uh, want to ask, after, any questions. </sentence><sentence id="151">So I asked the priest, uh, "I would really like, uh, to have some of my questions answered, because, uh, I have some doubts about, uh, that teaching." </sentence><sentence id="152">And he said, "That's what I want!" </sentence><sentence id="153">And so I asked him for a whole hour the different questions. </sentence><sentence id="154">About, for example, the involvement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="155">And, uh, he said that this was the greatest shame. </sentence><sentence id="156">It should never happen again. </sentence><sentence id="157">And at the end of that hour, he came to my <span class="spatial object">desk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">He said, "It never happened to me that anyone asked so many questions. </sentence><sentence id="159">And, for example, also about if the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span> can really claim that they are the only true faith." </sentence><sentence id="160">So he said, "Believe me, I would rather have a handful Catholics what would die for their faith, but not so many millions what only on the paper." </sentence><sentence id="161">And then when he asked where I got this knowledge, uh, of the Bible and, uh, I was able to ask him such questions; so I explained to him that our father teach us from the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="162">And he said, "You are on the right <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">Just continue." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: So what were some of the...the pressures that you began to see from "33 to "38, when Hitler took over [in <span class="country">Austria</span>]? </sentence><sentence id="191">What were some of the changes that were taking place in your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yes, the changes were a few months later [from] when I had that discussion. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh, Hitler moved in. </sentence><sentence id="196">And then it became really such a, uh, uh, pressure and change. </sentence><sentence id="197">Uh, people were watched, uh, everything they did. </sentence><sentence id="198">They took account of everyone who did not salute it. </sentence><sentence id="199">And, for example, I had, uh, refused to answer the Hitler greeting. </sentence><sentence id="200">And it took...it took not too long and I was called before, uh, SA group--some of the party informations that I had refused twelve times the greetings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: And what is that greeting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Hail Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="211">And so they want to put me in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">But the master painter was avoiding, by  excusing, uh, me that I should finish my training and that he needs me. </sentence><sentence id="213">And so I got still through without being taken to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: You mean, other people were reporting you? </sentence><sentence id="219">On you, ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: ...that you wouldn't "Heil, Hitler"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="227">There were, uh, papers asking me to answer with a Hitler greeting. </sentence><sentence id="228">But we explained to him that we never will hail a man. </sentence><sentence id="229">That this only belongs to our Creator, Jehovah God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="235">So then all of this took place when you were still under twenty-one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: And in <span class="country">Austria</span>, what age is that--the age of twenty-one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: Twenty-one, when you are full responsible. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh, like, uh, when you are called in the services, in the army. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then you are full responsible. </sentence><sentence id="245">But not before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="251">OK. </sentence><sentence id="252">So then in the year 1938, when Hitler finally took over, what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, the first thing was that they called my father for registration. </sentence><sentence id="257">And in 1939 already, before the Polish War started and, uh, at that <span class="building">Commission</span>, they said it was visible that my father was a invalid, partly from the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="258">He suffered [sublalian (ph)] arthritis; he lost all his teeth right in that time. </sentence><sentence id="259">And then they said, uh, he should be left alone and sent back, because he had enough from the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="260">But then there was some question put to him by some of the German officers. </sentence><sentence id="261">And he said that it would be also against his conscience as one of Jehovah's Witnesses to have anything to do with war. </sentence><sentence id="262">And despite that he was not eligible for war service, they kept him there. </sentence><sentence id="263">He was transferred in, uh, <span class="building">military jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">And there, uh, he had to wait about three months, uh, [to] be transferred from the, uh, <span class="building">Vienna Army jail</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And there he was put before the <span class="building">War Court</span>, the <span class="building">Reichskriegsgericht</span> [Ger: <span class="building">State War Court</span>]; and there, he was sentenced with about twenty- eight other Witnesses to death. </sentence><sentence id="266">In the meantime, some of the town[s] people and the former mayor, uh, put up a petition; and, uh, they were signed by most of the people. </sentence><sentence id="267">Even some Nazis sent in letters of recommendations. </sentence><sentence id="268">And this was all ignored. </sentence><sentence id="269">And the one who had started that petition was nearly put to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And they warned him not to do anything like that anymore. </sentence><sentence id="271">There were still people favored; and they liked my father. </sentence><sentence id="272">In that letter was stated he was an example for the <span class="populated place">community</span>, that he was a very loving neighbor and that he helped everyone. </sentence><sentence id="273">But this didn't help anything. </sentence><sentence id="274">They beheaded him. </sentence><sentence id="275">And it is really a coincidence that today is that very day. </sentence><sentence id="276">The 7th December of 1935 [1939]--fifty years since  my father was beheaded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: You mean, 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yes, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="301">On the 7th...7th of December; that's right. </sentence><sentence id="302">Today [is] fifty years since that date. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Now, did you mention before that your two brothers were also there as well, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Uh, no. </sentence><sentence id="309">At...at that time, uh, there were some other, uh, uh, Witnesses from, uh...some from that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">But my... was put uh, uh...three months later, uh, I was called up in the work services [NB: Arbeitsdienst]. </sentence><sentence id="311">But my second oldest brother [Gregor Jr.] was, uh, called, after he became twenty-one, uh, to the air force [NB: Luftwaffe]. </sentence><sentence id="312">And he took the stand of one of Jehovah's Witnesses; and he was sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="313">And they waited nearly five months with the execution. </sentence><sentence id="314">Because, uh, everyone had the chance to sign a form that he is not following anymore Jehovah's Witnesses; and also, that he breaks, uh, his oath to Jehovah God and is willing to serve Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="315">My father had one month time. </sentence><sentence id="316">And my brother--twenty- two year old brother--had two...uh, five months time; but he did not, uh, sign the paper. </sentence><sentence id="317">But this were ...this was very hard for him. </sentence><sentence id="318">I had the occasion to meet one of the <span class="building">barbers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">He [the barber] was transferred from the <span class="interior space">execution chamber</span> of uh...to our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">And he was, uh, cutting his hair and shaving him. </sentence><sentence id="321">And he noticed that I had the same name; and he remembered that this was my brother what he was, uh, serving there in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">And he said it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="323">He had, day and night, heavy chains on their arms and weights on their legs before the execution. </sentence><sentence id="324">Day and night. </sentence><sentence id="325">They only were taken off during mealtime, or when they used the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: What was the name of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, or the place your brother was at, before he was executed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: This was...most were executed in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>--in [the] <span class="dlf">Pletzensee</span>, where thousands were executed. </sentence><sentence id="347">And some were executed in <span class="populated place">Brandenburg</span>, also in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">And some were executed in other places; like, uh, from our congregation there were different ones. </sentence><sentence id="349">Uh, even some were gassed in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="355">Well, since Jehovah's Witnesses were such a small group, why was Hitler interested in killing them or destroying them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: Yes, uh, because of their firm stand that they were staying neutral and not taking part in Hitler's, uh, goal to rule the world. </sentence><sentence id="359">And they feared if more people would take that stand, so it would be very damaging. </sentence><sentence id="360">And that's why it came up, uh, even in all the <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">For example, Pastor Niemieller* was saying in that connection, after the war in one of his big  gatherings, "If we had taken the stand with the <span class="building">Catholic Church</span> as true Christians, Hitler could have never gone that far. </sentence><sentence id="362">And there's no excuse. </sentence><sentence id="363">Because many are saying, today, "We were forced to take part in that war. </sentence><sentence id="364">We were forced by Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="365">He said--Pastor Niem6ller-- "We have seen a group of Christians which were not only giving up their freedom. </sentence><sentence id="366">Many were giving up their lives, to keep faith alive in those dark days. </sentence><sentence id="367">These were Jehovah's Witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="368">And if they were able do it, we could have done it." </sentence><sentence id="369">And the same comment made even, uh, before, by Chancellor Adenauer" in a letter, according to Der Spiegel. </sentence><sentence id="370">And Eisenhower, where he said the <span class="building">churches</span> had a great responsibility in the concen...on the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">If they had spoken up, Hitler could have never, uh, be able to bring about these terrible things in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Now, why was it that they beheaded, uh, your father and brother and other Jehovah's Witnesses, instead of just shooting them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Yes, they did, uh, shoot only, uh, two brothers I know from <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">But, uh, it was then changed, because they were not worth it being executed. </sentence><sentence id="390">This was a honorable way of execution. </sentence><sentence id="391">And beheading was dishonorable. </sentence><sentence id="392">This was the reason. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="399">OK, so then that's what happened to your family. </sentence><sentence id="400">Now, what happened to your two brothers who were young? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Yes, uh, after my second brother, uh, was, uh, executed, they took the other two, uh, younger brothers--they were about thirteen years old, one was fourteen--and the two sisters--one was, uh, also in the age of about fifteen; sixteen, the second. </sentence><sentence id="405">They took them away, so that she would...they would not be influenced, uh, by their mother. </sentence><sentence id="406">Because my mother was still raising them and teaching them in the spirit of, uh, the truth with the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="407">And so they tried to take them away from that influence. </sentence><sentence id="408">They even in a letter apologized that they have taken them away, because they know that they had a very good upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="409">And so the two sisters were taken to some <span class="building">homes</span>, some...what were directed by nuns. </sentence><sentence id="410">And also, my two, uh, younger brothers were taken to the <span class="dlf">French border</span> near <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>, in the Landau.deg And there they were indoctrinated ...they tried to indoctrinate them with, uh, the Hitler teaching. </sentence><sentence id="411">There were some special instructors coming in. </sentence><sentence id="412">And because my little brothers refused to hail Hitler when they asked them, then they kicked them. </sentence><sentence id="413">Uh, one of the little brothers was once, uh, bleeding all over the face. </sentence><sentence id="414">Uh, they was kicked around, they landed in the <span class="env feature">gravel</span> there behind this <span class="building">institutions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">And then later, they forced them to that <span class="building">home</span> defense. </sentence><sentence id="416">And that little brother was still shot." </sentence><sentence id="417">Uh, lost his life, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="432">Q: He was shot? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="434">They were not aware that already, uh, fighting took place in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">And he was shot, too. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="437">And how old was he at the time that he was shot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: Sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="441">About sixteen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: Sixteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="445">And then what happened to your other brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: The other brother was taken down to the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>; and he was, uh, injured down there. </sentence><sentence id="449">And he was in quite bad shape during all this years, uh, kept in that <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="450">And he did survive, but he died in a...a accident later. </sentence><sentence id="451">But the two sisters, they... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: What are their names now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
