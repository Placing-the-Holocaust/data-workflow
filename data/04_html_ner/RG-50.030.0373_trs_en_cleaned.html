[ </sentence><sentence id="25">have a brother, a sister who was born in 1935 and a brother who was born in 1938.And we had, we lived in a very nice <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> which to me remains the epitome of a nice <span class="building">family house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">My grandmother's <span class="building">house</span> was also a very nice one. </sentence><sentence id="27">And we very frequently met our cousins and uncles and all of that, the whole family, in her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in that big <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">Actually, we had a sort of a little reunion of the cousins who were around practically every week. </sentence><sentence id="29">Every Tuesday. </sentence><sentence id="30">And we gathered around the big <span class="spatial object">table</span> with sweets, cookies and breads and you would call them danish, but we didn't call them that. </sentence><sentence id="31">Then in 1938, my parents bought another <span class="building">house</span> which I didn't like and I never did like it. </sentence><sentence id="32">Even though we lived in it for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="33">And, well, shall I tell you about our, the things we did for entertainment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: Yes, but just one moment, please. </sentence><sentence id="55">Are you hearing the <span class="spatial object">clock</span>? </sentence><sentence id="56">Well, what I'm trying to get a sense of, of course, is your lifestyle, what was disrupted because, clearly, in 1940, things changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Oh, absolutely, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: And also a sense of your religious affiliation, all of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: Well, my, on my mother's side, let's say they were, theoretical Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="65">On my father's side, they were very devout Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="66">Everybody went to <span class="building">church</span> on Sunday, every Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="67">And to confession a few times a year. </sentence><sentence id="68">Just to get the load off their chest, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="69">On my mother's side, they were the type of Catholics who went to <span class="building">church</span> for a baptism, wedding and funeral. </sentence><sentence id="70">My, on my father's side, my grandmother was a practical religious person. </sentence><sentence id="71">She didn't go for, you know, a lot of babbling and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="72">But, she thought religion should be applied to your day-to-day life in a practical way. </sentence><sentence id="73">In other words, you know, it, she didn't believe much in kneeling on <span class="spatial object">bench</span> and then going like this and so on. </sentence><sentence id="74">She said, do this  thing right because that's the way God wants you to do it. </sentence><sentence id="75">And do that thing right and, you know, you'll be rewarded in your other life. </sentence><sentence id="76">And, you know, she wanted to make religion a real part of their, of her life and our lives. </sentence><sentence id="77">And she actually didn't spend all that much time, well, just one, she, you know, didn't spend all that much time in <span class="building">church</span> and that's the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="78">Just because, as I say, she was much more of a pragmatic person. </sentence><sentence id="79">Very interesting lady, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="80">What else can I say? </sentence><sentence id="81">Well, we celebrated, of course, all the religious holidays in a very extensive way. </sentence><sentence id="82">Mostly, Christmas and Easter. </sentence><sentence id="83">But, you may know or not know, that in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in addition to Christmas, the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that was the big event for the children before World War II. </sentence><sentence id="84">We would all gather to, first in our own <span class="building">homes</span> and then later to grandmother's <span class="building">home</span>, and get all the toys and candies. </sentence><sentence id="85">That would make us sick for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="86">But they were delightful anyway. </sentence><sentence id="87">And we would sometimes go to the <span class="env feature">seaside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">In fact, quite frequently. </sentence><sentence id="89">And the whole family would also meet there. </sentence><sentence id="90">We wouldn't always stay in the same place, but since, you know, the <span class="env feature">Belgian sea coast</span> is very small, it was always easy to go from one <span class="populated place">village</span> to the other. </sentence><sentence id="91">And we would have big picnics and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="92">We were a very closely knit family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Now, there were other people, other relatives of yours, who were very involved with the <span class="building">Catholic church</span>, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="125">My uncle, Father Bruno(ph), was a Benedictine Monk and he had three sisters, my three aunts, who were nuns. </sentence><sentence id="126">Two of them were <span class="building">Benedictine Nuns</span> in Liesch(ph), <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">The third one was a <span class="building">Sister of Notre Dame</span>, which is a teaching order. </sentence><sentence id="128">And she was, she moved to various <span class="building">convents</span> during her life. </sentence><sentence id="129">She is currently alive and well in Namure(ph), <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">She is 88 years old, almost 89. </sentence><sentence id="131">And clear as a bell, sharp as a tack. </sentence><sentence id="132">And she participated in Father Bruno's work quite a bit, too. </sentence><sentence id="133">As did the other sisters, who are now deceased. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: Did you go to <span class="building">religious school</span> or to <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: No, it was traditional... Pause in tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: I was asking you if went to public or <span class="building">religious school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: We went to <span class="building">religious schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">We, in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, the <span class="populated place">diocese</span> or, you know, the lay, not the lay, but the nun, <span class="building">monastic schools</span>, are called <span class="building">colleges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">It has nothing to do with <span class="building">American college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">You're in <span class="building">college</span> from your first grade on. </sentence><sentence id="155">Until your 12th grade. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, yes, I did go to, first to a small <span class="building">school</span> where the nuns were running the <span class="building">school</span> and I was very privileged in having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten teacher, and I've never forgot her. </sentence><sentence id="157">I still remember her as being a real guidance. </sentence><sentence id="158">And then I went to the <span class="building">college</span>, St. Bonefas(ph) in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">Where my father had been, where my uncles had been. </sentence><sentence id="160">And it was almost a family tradition already. </sentence><sentence id="161">Still in existence now. </sentence><sentence id="162">And, in fact, my brother was there, too. </sentence><sentence id="163">And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins,  actually, went through the same <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a very, very wonderful <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">I had the best teachers you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="166">And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="167">No, I loved <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">I just adored my teachers. </sentence><sentence id="169">In the seventh grade I had a very tall, very powerful looking priest as a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="170">And I can still hear him talking. </sentence><sentence id="171">He was extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="172">He made us live Julius Caesar's wars. </sentence><sentence id="173">Like you'd see a movie. </sentence><sentence id="174">And a couple of three years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian Alden(ph), the south of <span class="country">Belgium</span> where the <span class="env feature">forests</span> are and those people have their feet on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">Solidly on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and he did, too. </sentence><sentence id="176">And, again, I have such extraordinary memories from my <span class="building">high school</span>, you know, that I still relive them constantly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Because you came from a family that at least was partly quite religious and you went to <span class="building">religious schools</span>, were there certain values that were instilled in you from an early age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Oh, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="206">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="207">As I told you, my grandmother was running the <span class="building">house</span> even from a distance, she was still running her children. </sentence><sentence id="208">Her children's <span class="building">houses</span> with her strong principles that, you know, of charity, of tolerance. </sentence><sentence id="209">Even though she was strict, she was tolerant. </sentence><sentence id="210">You know, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="211">She was strict in her tolerance, you see what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="212">You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you couldn't feel it immediately. </sentence><sentence id="213">You just had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="214">And that was one of the principles that she inoculated into us from our very, very small childhood. </sentence><sentence id="215">And I think my, all my uncles and aunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles. </sentence><sentence id="216">So, yes, mostly Christian values. </sentence><sentence id="217">And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non- Christian people? </sentence><sentence id="218">Like the Jews and so on. </sentence><sentence id="219">We didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="220">In <span class="country">Belgium</span>, you didn't make that distinction. </sentence><sentence id="221">I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS came and took them away. </sentence><sentence id="222">We were friends with them, we played in the <span class="dlf">park</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="223">We, you know, <span class="country">Belgium</span> was not at all a discriminatory country or discriminating country. </sentence><sentence id="224">I'm bringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span>, you have to say, I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="225">There is no such thing in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">The identity cards that were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="227">It mentioned profession, job, that they did. </sentence><sentence id="228">But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of discriminatory inkling, if | may say. </sentence><sentence id="229">So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high values were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that included that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were. </sentence><sentence id="230">Not because they had red hair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="231">But, because they were just people. </sentence><sentence id="232">I think that is of extreme importance for what is going to follow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism in <span class="country">Belgium</span> at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: No, I was not. </sentence><sentence id="264">I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in <span class="country">France</span>, for example. </sentence><sentence id="265"><span class="country">France</span> has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if you want. </sentence><sentence id="266">Which was definitely anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="267">We didn't have that. </sentence><sentence id="268">Actually, it's to the point that we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because we had no way of knowing. </sentence><sentence id="270">We had no records. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Were you, as a kid, involved with any social or political organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Not a <span class="building">political organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="274">In <span class="country">Belgium</span> we had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there were the <span class="building">public school</span> cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts. </sentence><sentence id="275">They were friendly, but they were different. </sentence><sentence id="276">I was part of the Christian cub scouts. </sentence><sentence id="277">Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was part of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things. </sentence><sentence id="278">But, it didn't amount to very much. </sentence><sentence id="279">Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group activity, let's say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And, your family, while they believed very strongly in charity, was that ever on any organized basis before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: My grandmother had a <span class="dlf">route</span>, if you want to say, or <span class="dlf">route</span> where she went and distributed food on a certain day every month. </sentence><sentence id="291">Part of the <span class="building">St. Vincent DePaul</span> general organization, which exists in <span class="country">France</span> and exists in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And it consists of lay people who just get together and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families. </sentence><sentence id="293">They visit them, and I think this is still being done, I'm not sure, but I think so. </sentence><sentence id="294">Right now. </sentence><sentence id="295">They bring them food or clothes and try to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="296">That was, in a way, organized, if you want. </sentence><sentence id="297">Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide organization for the blind. </sentence><sentence id="298">And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of that for quite some time. </sentence><sentence id="299">And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind people assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as necessary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: One other question. </sentence><sentence id="311">What kind of a child were you? </sentence><sentence id="312">If you had to sort of describe your energy, your... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="317">But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but I do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child. </sentence><sentence id="318">So, I guess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she wanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="319">I think she taught me good social behavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery. </sentence><sentence id="320">I was running up and down and doing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things. </sentence><sentence id="321">Like making mud pies and throwing them at each other. </sentence><sentence id="322">And one day my aunt visited us and my mother just showed her out to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and while they were gone, we decided to sample the port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why the <span class="building">house</span> was spinning so much around me. </sentence><sentence id="323">And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up the next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure. </sentence><sentence id="324">In <span class="building">school</span>, as I say, I enjoyed <span class="building">school</span> enormously. </sentence><sentence id="325">And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden for me to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty decent grades. </sentence><sentence id="327">That way. </sentence><sentence id="328">It wasn't any, you know, great effort. </sentence><sentence id="329">I didn't really force myself, I just studied because I thought it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="330">And particularly the literary branches, such as Latin, Greek. </sentence><sentence id="331">And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were  something where I literally basked in learning those. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not always cloistered. </sentence><sentence id="351">In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">Even before the war. </sentence><sentence id="353">He taught catechism at the <span class="dlf">Belgian border</span> to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi children who would cross the <span class="dlf">border</span> before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in <span class="country">Germany</span> and under Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="354">He went to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> during the sad events of 1938 and so on. </sentence><sentence id="355">And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out for, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee where he made me jump on his knee. </sentence><sentence id="356">And I liked him very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="357">He was the image of perfection to me. </sentence><sentence id="358">He was almost a semi-god. </sentence><sentence id="359">I had an excellent relationship with him and I kept that relation throughout until his death. </sentence><sentence id="360">Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him as much as I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="361">But, I had an excellent relationship with him. </sentence><sentence id="362">He was a very warm, outgoing person, very funny, too. </sentence><sentence id="363">He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: What did you know about Hitler and Nazism before <span class="country">Belgium</span> was occupied? </sentence><sentence id="379">Did you know much... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: Hardly anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: ...German refugees coming in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: We saw a few. </sentence><sentence id="387">And, as a matter of fact, this is not Hitler it's Mussolini, in 1938, my parents took in a young Italian girl, about 14 or 15, to be our babysitter. </sentence><sentence id="388">Because her parents, her father was an active Socialist and had to leave <span class="country">Italy</span> under the Fascist regime, and fled to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">And, just as an aside, I absolutely adored that lady and I lost track of her completely until 1986. </sentence><sentence id="390">I decided, I've got to find her again. </sentence><sentence id="391">So, I wrote a letter to the mayor of her <span class="populated place">town</span> asking, is this lady still alive? </sentence><sentence id="392">Does she live in that <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence><sentence id="393">I didn't get an answer for about six months, but one day I got a letter from her. </sentence><sentence id="394">So, obviously, the mayor had passed on the letter to her. </sentence><sentence id="395">She wrote me and said, I remember you as if it was yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="396">I went to see her in Asti(ph) in the north of <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="397">She came here. </sentence><sentence id="398">And we're still writing to each other every month and the most adorable lady. </sentence><sentence id="399">So, that's one thing I did know. </sentence><sentence id="400">About Fascism. </sentence><sentence id="401">As you say, we did see a few, yes, a few refugees, but, you know, until 19, well, in 1940, I was just nine years old and at that time, I don't think I understood the full impact. </sentence><sentence id="402">But, you grow very rapidly in a war, you know. </sentence><sentence id="403">It didn't take us more than a couple of years before we had it all assimilated and we understood what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="404">Well, not everything, but nobody else did. </sentence><sentence id="405">But, we understood, I think, far more than we would have if we hadn't been occupied. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="433">And then we heard some bombs falling. </sentence><sentence id="434"><span class="populated place">Brussels</span> wasn't severely bombed, but the Germans did bomb <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> the first day of the war. </sentence><sentence id="435">I guess, more as a scare tactic than actual, you know, aim at destruction. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I remember that as if it was yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="437">And from then on, just about everything that occurred during the occupation is in my <span class="spatial object">computer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">And it comes back when, you know, when I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="439">| remember being a very bad boy. </sentence><sentence id="440">Stealing my mother's very scarce sugar and putting it into the gas tanks of the <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span> that were parked in the <span class="dlf">street</span> in the front of my <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="441">We were a little group of kids and one of them would be watching the sentry and he was going up the <span class="dlf">street</span>, we would immediately go and unscrew the caps and pour the sugar in there. </sentence><sentence id="442">And, you know, that gums up the <span class="spatial object">engines</span>, makes a mess of the <span class="spatial object">engine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">And I remember being kicked in the rear end by a couple of Femp(ph) Polezei(ph) who were searching us and, I guess, as I say, I must have been ornery because I probably talked back to him and he really, I can still feel the pain. </sentence><sentence id="444">And one time I was on a <span class="spatial object">street car</span> and there was, unfortunately, there were a few traitors as you know, in all the occupied countries, including <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="445">And it was the 21st of July, which is a Belgian national day, and I was carrying a little black, yellow and red flag, which is the Belgian colors, in my lapel. </sentence><sentence id="446">Very obvious. </sentence><sentence id="447">And one of those traitors came up on the <span class="spatial object">street car</span> and said, why do you have that on your lapel? </sentence><sentence id="448">And I said, why do you have it on that, I'm not going to say the word, but that uniform that you're wearing? </sentence><sentence id="449">And he slapped me in the  <span class="spatial object">street car</span> stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people. </sentence><sentence id="450">And everybody had to put their hands up. </sentence><sentence id="451">And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a pistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this. </sentence><sentence id="452">The Germans searched him but didn't look inside his newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="453">And he was never found out. </sentence><sentence id="454">But, you know, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="495">How your life, personally, changed. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes. </sentence><sentence id="497">Because they tried to go easy. </sentence><sentence id="498">And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor. </sentence><sentence id="499">We did not have a Golighter(ph). </sentence><sentence id="500">We didn't have an SS general at that time. </sentence><sentence id="501">We only had one general who was an anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="502">General Alexander from Falkenhausen(ph). </sentence><sentence id="503">Who was an old Prussian aristocrat who actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians. </sentence><sentence id="504">So, the first few months were not all that bad actually. </sentence><sentence id="505">Except for the obvious presence of the German army. </sentence><sentence id="506">The parades and all that sort of things. </sentence><sentence id="507">And, of course, the rationing. </sentence><sentence id="508">The scarcity of essentials. </sentence><sentence id="509">Which, actually, became much, much worse as of probably 1943. </sentence><sentence id="510">In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were that miserable. </sentence><sentence id="511">But in 1942, then <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> realized that the military governor was not being strong enough, was not being harsh enough. </sentence><sentence id="512">And we received then, an SS man who sort of took over the, quote, political aspect. </sentence><sentence id="513">In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army which in itself wasn't all that bad. </sentence><sentence id="514">That's when things began to change very drastically. </sentence><sentence id="515">The day-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="516">Various supplies. </sentence><sentence id="517">There was no gasoline for my father's little <span class="spatial object">car</span> which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep. </sentence><sentence id="518">But there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good. </sentence><sentence id="519">And things like that. </sentence><sentence id="520">And then, we began to see things changing even more drastically. </sentence><sentence id="521">That's when we saw people being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="522">We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="523">We thought maybe they had done some bad things. </sentence><sentence id="524">And were being put in <span class="building">jail</span> for that. </sentence><sentence id="525">And then, pretty quickly, it became obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either something to do with the Resistance or simply hostages. </sentence><sentence id="526">People who were not Jewish that hadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of resistance and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="527">Or for having hidden resistance or people who were resistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed. </sentence><sentence id="528">That's another thing that didn't come immediately. </sentence><sentence id="529">Forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="530">Young people taken to <span class="country">Germany</span> forcibly to work. </sentence><sentence id="531">Not necessarily to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but to <span class="building">factories</span> and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="532">Being paid a measly salary and living in squalor and terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="533">And, of course, it didn't take long before the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="534">Electricity became limited. </sentence><sentence id="535">We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night. </sentence><sentence id="536">Curfews, of course. </sentence><sentence id="537">That began pretty early in the war. </sentence><sentence id="538">Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly enforced. </sentence><sentence id="539">Again, it was still the army at that time. </sentence><sentence id="540">But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police  came, those things were strictly enforced. </sentence><sentence id="541">And if you were out in the <span class="dlf">street</span> at 8:30, you immediately went to <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">You know, not just getting a ticket or something. </sentence><sentence id="543">You were taken to <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">And, the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were limited. </sentence><sentence id="545">There was hardly any coal for the <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span>. </sentence><sentence id="546">Except for the <span class="spatial object">German transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="547">And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first <span class="spatial object">Jewish transports</span> that lever saw, at the end of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="548">At first I didn't realize what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="549">But, I saw lots of people being packed in, they weren't yet using <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">They were using very old <span class="spatial object">third class cars</span> with, which were boarded, the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were boarded up. </sentence><sentence id="551">And, but the people were still sitting on <span class="spatial object">benches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">But, I saw them because there was a <span class="building">railroad station</span> only about three or four <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">And the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> were down and so you could see from a little <span class="dlf">wall</span> and there were <span class="dlf">iron gates</span>, if you want, you could see through the <span class="dlf">gates</span> what was going on down there. </sentence><sentence id="555">And I saw this <span class="spatial object">train</span> where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="556">And then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are? </sentence><sentence id="557">No. </sentence><sentence id="558">Well, these are Jewish people that are taken to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">That's the first time I ever saw a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">And I remember that as if it was yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="561">What else? </sentence><sentence id="562">Well, of course, the <span class="populated place">city</span> was down completely as far as activity is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="563">There were some <span class="building">movie theaters</span> playing German movies and propaganda, of course. </sentence><sentence id="564">All English or American or French movies were outlawed. </sentence><sentence id="565">I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="566">When, just after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="567">My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing. </sentence><sentence id="568">Then after World War II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but that's neither here nor there. </sentence><sentence id="569">During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that was important. </sentence><sentence id="570">Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it. </sentence><sentence id="571">As I say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things began to go very badly. </sentence><sentence id="572">We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="573">Sometimes maybe twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="574">Meat was rarely, rarely available. </sentence><sentence id="575">We were extremely lucky in <span class="country">Belgium</span> that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an enormous <span class="env feature">bank</span> of herring began to swim right off the <span class="dlf">Belgian coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">Within a mile or so. </sentence><sentence id="577">The <span class="spatial object">fishing boats</span> were allowed two <span class="dlf">lines</span>, so they were allowed to go and fish those herring. </sentence><sentence id="578">And for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="579">And I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting until 10:00 or 11:00 in <span class="dlf">line</span>, standing there. </sentence><sentence id="580">Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="581">And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that. </sentence><sentence id="582">My mother had to learn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had herring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life. </sentence><sentence id="583">But it saved us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: <span class="building">School</span>, at first there was no <span class="building">school</span> for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="675">But it started again in September. </sentence><sentence id="676">You know, the war began in May, it started again in September. </sentence><sentence id="677">And the first year it was <span class="building">school</span> as usual. </sentence><sentence id="678">But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi controlled versions were allowed. </sentence><sentence id="679">We were, that was mostly in <span class="building">high school</span> later on. </sentence><sentence id="680">But, we were allowed to learn English after we had learned German first. </sentence><sentence id="681">It sounded awful at the time, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished <span class="building">high school</span> and all  0 my classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and English. </sentence><sentence id="682">Which has served me well, you know, later in my life. </sentence><sentence id="683">So, I guess I owe that to the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="684">But, I'm not grateful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: You've spoken about some of the ways in which your life was changed by the occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="698">Were you aware of the different kinds of restrictions on Jewish people? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="700">And we saw some of our friends being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="701">And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know, they're taken away. </sentence><sentence id="702">Because they are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="703">As I told you before, we didn't even have an inkling before World War II. </sentence><sentence id="704">We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go?Do you go to a <span class="building">synagogue</span> or do you go to a <span class="building">Catholic church</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="705">If they went to a <span class="building">Catholic church</span>, we would see them because they would go to the same one we did. </sentence><sentence id="706">But, the other people who were not in our <span class="building">church</span>, we didn't ask them what they did or where they went or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know. </sentence><sentence id="707">Yeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> taken by a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his <span class="dlf">office window</span> which was just above the <span class="building">building</span> where they took the people. </sentence><sentence id="708">So he took a picture, this was obviously forbidden, but he did anyway. </sentence><sentence id="709">They didn't catch him. </sentence><sentence id="710">We still have that picture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Were they wearing the yellow star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="727">As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="728">And, of course, at that time, it became quite obvious. </sentence><sentence id="729">Then in the center of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="730">I have a picture of that, too. </sentence><sentence id="731">They were forced to walk in the <span class="dlf">gutter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="732">And when it was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="733">But when it was raining they had their feet in the <span class="env feature">water</span> which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we didn't have any good shoes anyway. </sentence><sentence id="734">Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they would just fall apart in that <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might have survived it, even though resenting it. </sentence><sentence id="736">But, that was only the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="737">The yellow star, there were a number of people who in the <span class="spatial object">street car</span>, would ostentatiously get up and give their seat to a person wearing a yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="738">Particularly if there were German officers or German soldiers on the <span class="spatial object">street car</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="739">They would deliberately show, you know, say, please take my <span class="interior space">seat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="740">I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it. </sentence><sentence id="741">I've seen it happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: What was the reaction from the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="761">They wouldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="762">You know, actually, the individual German, particularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly aggressive when alone. </sentence><sentence id="763">As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive than the German army people. </sentence><sentence id="764">Now, I'm not talking about the <span class="building">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="765">But we didn't see the <span class="spatial object">SS</span> all that much. </sentence><sentence id="766">They were always in <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="767">They hardly ever were on foot. </sentence><sentence id="768">The people on foot were mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when  1 they were asked to do a search. </sentence><sentence id="769">And, you know, to line people up against a <span class="dlf">wall</span> and search them and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt. </sentence><sentence id="770">In general, the population was very understanding and sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="771">Now, there were a few bad ones. </sentence><sentence id="772">And I'm not going to deny that. </sentence><sentence id="773">I'm not proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="774">Nobody is. </sentence><sentence id="775">But, it wasn't as bad as in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="776">I can assure you of that. </sentence><sentence id="777">We could see that a number of <span class="building">shops</span> where we had been shopping regularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed. </sentence><sentence id="778">There was nobody there any more. </sentence><sentence id="779">And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own <span class="country">country</span>, take over the <span class="building">Jewish businesses</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="800">Q: So, you were telling me about the general climate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: And you said that most of the Belgian public was supportive of, I guess, the Jewish population? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="807">And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as we said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time. </sentence><sentence id="808">They, you will hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the largest newspaper in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> was actually Nazi controlled completely. </sentence><sentence id="809">But, interestingly enough, it was Jewish owned. </sentence><sentence id="810">But the owner went to <span class="country">England</span>, so the paper was taken over by pro-Nazi people. </sentence><sentence id="811">The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the Catholic ones, just shut down. </sentence><sentence id="812">They didn't publish any more. </sentence><sentence id="813">So the only paper we really had was Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="814">Which was Nazi controlled entirely. </sentence><sentence id="815">Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in 1943, which is the national day of <span class="country">Belgium</span>, there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which had been printed and put out by the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="816">And, at first, it was so well made that people didn't realize it was not the real one. </sentence><sentence id="817">And they just took it and then you could see the people picking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="818">We shall win and we'll crush the <span class="spatial object">Bosch</span> and naming all the traitors and that sort of thing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny stories were written in there, too. </sentence><sentence id="819">And that was a day of levity during World War II when the entire <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> was covered with <span class="spatial object">Neswah</span>, but not the real one. </sentence><sentence id="820">Which was, of course, much more real than the Nazi controlled one. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my <span class="building">house</span> we had a housekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) if you want, cleaned the <span class="interior space">entrance hallway</span> where my father's patients would come because in <span class="country">Europe</span>, many doctors had their <span class="building">office</span> in their <span class="building">house</span>, it was very common. </sentence><sentence id="841">And so did my father. </sentence><sentence id="842">And her son was a career soldier in the Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one of the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us, because he had to come <span class="building">home</span> occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing  2 and he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there. </sentence><sentence id="843">So, I became quickly aware that there was something going on. </sentence><sentence id="844">And so did my sister and brother who were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again. </sentence><sentence id="845">Roger, Roger. </sentence><sentence id="846">Yeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was exactly my age and slept on the <span class="interior space">third floor</span> and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook me and said, hurry up, open the <span class="dlf">back windows</span> and hurry up, the Germans are at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="847">And Roger was in the <span class="building">house</span> at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="848">Which was, of course, on purpose. </sentence><sentence id="849">He immediately ran out the <span class="dlf">roof windows</span>, you know those <span class="dlf">roof windows</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span> where you can lift like a trap, the <span class="dlf">window</span>, and he ran out that way and was able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, but, you know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there. </sentence><sentence id="850">So, they searched the <span class="building">house</span>, these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually. </sentence><sentence id="851">And they searched the <span class="building">house</span>, didn't find anything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his <span class="dlf">passage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="852">And after that, he never came <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="853">It must have been later in the war, it must have been 1943 or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="854">And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="855">I don't think we made any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance. </sentence><sentence id="856">That probably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time. </sentence><sentence id="857">But then, when my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early "43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently. </sentence><sentence id="858">We, he didn't say anything, you know, he was very, very quiet and never said a word. </sentence><sentence id="859">He never said, I am helping Jewish children escape. </sentence><sentence id="860">But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's <span class="building">house</span>, and I was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know? </sentence><sentence id="861">And at that point, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal. </sentence><sentence id="862">And I didn't say anything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an adult. </sentence><sentence id="863">And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive with me. </sentence><sentence id="864">I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to. </sentence><sentence id="865">And so he became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a place or there would be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is Robert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="866">But, and, do you know where such and such <span class="dlf">street</span> is? </sentence><sentence id="867">Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="868">Well, why don't you take the <span class="spatial object">street car</span> and go to such and such <span class="building">house</span> there and tell them that Robert is looking for a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="869">And that's all he ever said. </sentence><sentence id="870">You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="871">And Robert always had a war name, a different name. </sentence><sentence id="872">One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called him Roger. </sentence><sentence id="873">Roger Dumois(ph). </sentence><sentence id="874">And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six months. </sentence><sentence id="875">In my other uncle's <span class="building">house</span>, my younger uncle, the dentist. </sentence><sentence id="876">Jean(ph), who worked in very close cooperation with Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="877">That was my grandmother's <span class="building">house</span> and he was the only child of my grandmother's who stayed in the <span class="building">family home</span> after he was married because he occupied my grandfather's <span class="building">medical office</span> as a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="878">So he didn't have to look for another place and my grandmother just took the <span class="interior space">upper floor</span> for herself. </sentence><sentence id="879">And so, the kids were brought there frequently. </sentence><sentence id="880">I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>, she had a lot of <span class="spatial object">chairs</span> because she had a lot of children. </sentence><sentence id="881">Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of course, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything. </sentence><sentence id="882">She says, Oh, we're just having a little party. </sentence><sentence id="883">And there were eight Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="884">One of whom stayed and, it  3 was a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my grandmother's curtains. </sentence><sentence id="885">But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="886">But, this is how I, you know, I realized what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="887">And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his real name. </sentence><sentence id="888">Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="889">I had never seen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that. </sentence><sentence id="890">But, after a while, of course, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him. </sentence><sentence id="891">And he had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and he would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> inside and disappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's <span class="building">house</span> because he had a, there was a better heating system in his <span class="building">house</span> than in my parent's second <span class="building">house</span>, which I didn't like anyway. </sentence><sentence id="892">And, so I did get to see quite a number of the proteges, as my uncle used to call them. </sentence><sentence id="893">And, okay, what else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: Well, since you mentioned this boy that you actually lived with for quite some time, this Jewish boy, I'm just curious if you, what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="949">Was he scared? </sentence><sentence id="950">Did you talk about things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="954">A: I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally. </sentence><sentence id="955">There was a feeling of security in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="957">Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="958">He went to <span class="building">school</span> with me to the <span class="building">College</span> , of course, where else? </sentence><sentence id="959">It happens that that  4 End of tape #2  5 Tape #3 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="960"> ..down a little bit, they might be a little... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: Well, they're already down. </sentence><sentence id="962">No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a little. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="981">Q: But I was asking you whether, at any point, you ever talked to him about what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="983">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="985">Q: What was going on in the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="987">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="988">That was a no-no. </sentence><sentence id="989">And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about events surrounding the children. </sentence><sentence id="990">Any child that was under his protection, if you want to say. </sentence><sentence id="991">It just was too risky. </sentence><sentence id="992">You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death, not only of the child, but everybody around the child. </sentence><sentence id="993">So, no. </sentence><sentence id="994">As little talk as possible. </sentence><sentence id="995">How do you say that? </sentence><sentence id="996">The enemy has ears everywhere? </sentence><sentence id="997">Or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="998">We were very aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="999">And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was already, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began to understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Now, on the contrary, we had a little <span class="building">club</span>, if you want, of <span class="building">school</span> kids, we thought of ourselves as very important. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And we had a <span class="building">club</span> which was our <span class="building">resistance club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1002">It didn't do much resistance, but we were organized as a <span class="building">military club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1003">There was a colonel and there was a couple of majors and a couple of captains and if you did well, if you, for example, you could report on seeing so many <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span> going by, then you got promoted. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And if you had counted how many <span class="spatial object">B-17's</span> are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a commendation of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="1005">We had to know by heart, all the types of <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span>, enemy or  6 friendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1006">It didn't amount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1007">You know. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And we would hide in the, somebody's <span class="interior space">basement</span> so the Germans wouldn't hear us. </sentence><sentence id="1009">It was very secret. </sentence><sentence id="1010">That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1011">When I was still a little more innocent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q: Did you every do any little, you mentioned putting the sugar in the <span class="spatial object">gas tanks</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1040">That was part of our assignments. </sentence><sentence id="1041">If we did that, that was a great big promotion because, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And you could be promoted from second lieutenant all the way to major for doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And when my mother found out about that, was she every unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have definitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in <span class="building">jail</span>, and that sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1055">Q: Were there other little sabotage activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1057">A: Well, yeah, flat <span class="spatial object">tires</span> and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1058">For some reason, a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> would suddenly develop a flat tire. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick of wood and put that in the, what do you call this <span class="spatial object">valve</span>, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1060">Where they inflate the <span class="spatial object">tire</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1061">Push it in and there's a little <span class="dlf">peg</span> in there that if you push it in, the <span class="env feature">air</span> goes out. </sentence><sentence id="1062">So, when nobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the <span class="env feature">air</span> would go out. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And the next morning the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> had a flat tire. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And, but again, all that didn't amount to much. </sentence><sentence id="1065">But, it's just the spirit, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We, it was a spirit of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1067">In our childish way, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Go ahead, I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1081">Q: Was that spirit of resistance fairly prevalent in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1083">A: Well, I can only speak about my own <span class="env feature">environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I would say that in my own <span class="region">environment</span>, it was. </sentence><sentence id="1085">It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable and badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And, the eight children, except perhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the <span class="spatial object">Bosch</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And it was still there 25 years later. </sentence><sentence id="1088">You just don't get rid of that sort of resentment so easily. </sentence><sentence id="1089">And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had already been imparted to us between the wars. </sentence><sentence id="1090">You know, when they were telling stories, oh, do you remember so and so? </sentence><sentence id="1091">Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the French and da, da, da. </sentence><sentence id="1092">So, we were living, see <span class="country">Belgium</span> has been occupied by foreign powers ever since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly independent minded people. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And it's only since 1830, that <span class="country">Belgium</span> has become a political entity of its own, a free, independent <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And then, but we, we have an ancestral tradition of hating the occupant. </sentence><sentence id="1095">You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the Spaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And, yeah, that spirit of anti-occupant was very prevalent in my <span class="region">environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It's difficult for me to judge, you know, how it was in other families. </sentence><sentence id="1098">But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say. </sentence><sentence id="1099"> 7 We never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1100">On the contrary, my father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their anti-Nazi attitudes and actions. </sentence><sentence id="1101">One of them died in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, the other one was killed by the SS on the last day of the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1102">He was, they came with a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and started shooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five minutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And then there was the governor of the <span class="building">national bank</span> who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And one day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> and said, are you Mr.Gallopan(ph)? </sentence><sentence id="1105">And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right on his <span class="dlf">doorstep</span>, right in front of his wife. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: Because of his efforts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1132">A: Because of his support of the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1133">You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts of money to be able to feed and clothe his children. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And he didn't have anything, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had left him as president of the <span class="building">national bank</span> knowing that he was not, he didn't like them. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So, he went to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I don't remember how much it was, every month. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And my other uncle, one of my other uncles by marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the <span class="building">bank</span> every month and kept the books. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Kept the accounting. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else in the <span class="building">bank</span> honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1148">Q: I do want to learn a lot more about this whole rescue effort, but I'd like you to tell me a bit more about what you did. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Your involvement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1152">A: Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement. </sentence><sentence id="1153">All I ever did, as I told you in this film before, is carry little letters and escort children from one point to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I was too young to do anything else at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So, that was my contribution, if you want, being a messenger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1160">Q: Do you remember specifically... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1162">A: And also being a <span class="building">school</span> mate, which probably brought a little comfort to Roger, among others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: Do you remember specifics of some of your messengering and escorting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: Well, the one picture I keep is my standing on the <span class="dlf">rear platform</span> of a <span class="spatial object">street car</span> with my arms stretched out on the <span class="dlf">railing</span>, on the back thing, and a Jewish child looking at me with a cap on his head, hiding his dark hair. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And my hair was light blond, very light blond, I was a perfect Aryan. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And we were just playing, you know, being silly kids. </sentence><sentence id="1169">With my blue eyes and my blond hair, the Germans would, there would be a few Germans on the <span class="spatial object">street cars</span>, but they  8 would probably just take one look at me and just, you know, ignore me. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And that was one picture that I remember very, very well. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Another incident was that, at that time, I was carrying a letter, but I was with my aunt, the wife of the dentist. </sentence><sentence id="1172">Of Jean, my aunt Ninette(ph), one of the women I have most loved in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And I was there with her and we were trying to find an address, and we couldn't find the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And at one point, there were Germans in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1175">They weren't looking for us, but she got scared and we ran away. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And then she said, you know, I shouldn't have run away because that may give us away. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I should have just said, and I said, well, let me go back by myself. </sentence><sentence id="1178">They're not going to bother me. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And I went back and I finally did find that <span class="building">house</span>, rang the <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> and delivered the letter, ran like heck out of there to find my aunt again. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And she was waiting around the comer on a <span class="spatial object">bench</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1181">That's, those are two incidents I do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1198">Q: How much did you know about what you were doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1200">A: Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually. </sentence><sentence id="1201">At first, we didn't really know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Certainly not before 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And even in 1942, early in the game, we were only sensing something was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And it was very important. </sentence><sentence id="1205">But, we couldn't pinpoint what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1206">But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war, there are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And it didn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and two together and began to realize how important it was. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And what was the purpose of all these kids coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And some I would never see again, some I would see again, maybe two or three months later. </sentence><sentence id="1210">That would be when a <span class="region">hiding place</span> would be blown for example, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1211">Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back. </sentence><sentence id="1212">People were talking or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1213">Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my little six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can perceive already. </sentence><sentence id="1214">So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people thought we were. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1232">Q: So you weren't given much information? </sentence><sentence id="1233">You didn't talk about it with your uncles or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1236">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1237">No. </sentence><sentence id="1238">The only thing that was talked to or talked about was where to go put a letter and where to take a child. </sentence><sentence id="1239">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="1240">No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Not at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Even though, you know, I'm sure that if I had been put under torture, I would have certainly said what I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1243">You know, at 12 or 13, you don't resist torture, you have to talk. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I'm sure I couldn't have withstood torture. </sentence><sentence id="1245">It never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1247">But I'm sure I would have given them more information than everybody else thought I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And I had a couple of cousins who were about my age, who knew almost as much as I did, even though they weren't quite so close to Father Bruno because they lived in a different <span class="building">house</span> in a different part of <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1249">But nevertheless, they weren't fools, they knew what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1270">A: Just families. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Just mostly families. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Occasionally a <span class="building">convent</span>, or occasionally a <span class="building">school</span>, but most of the time, families. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And I cannot be sure of that, but I believe that one time I took a child to this extraordinary lady who helped Father Bruno with at least 50 of the children, and was, never asked for any payment except for her <span class="spatial object">train</span> fare and an occasional lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And I think I met her then, but that's a little fuzzy in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I can't be absolutely sure. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Mostly, these were families or private persons. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A: Occasionally, some kids were pretty antsy, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Some of them would be kind of, you know, looking around and checking to see if they were being followed and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Mostly the older ones, I mean older, I mean 8, 9, 10 year olds. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Not a four or five year olds. </sentence><sentence id="1319">But, I think that, yeah, some of the older kids were scared, obviously scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1532">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And so, yes there were numbers of people from our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> who would come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Because they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with them our food. </sentence><sentence id="1535">And in that <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And there was an <span class="dlf">air intake</span>, a sort of a <span class="spatial object">column</span> about a foot and a half in diameter which let the air in and opened up in our <span class="interior space">back yard</span> and I was the air raid signaler. </sentence><sentence id="1538">I was in charge of listening if 1 could hear the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> and if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And also to warn them when it was the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1540">That was my duty at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1541">So, this is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And other than that, well, yeah, distributing whatever little food we had to some other people who had even less. </sentence><sentence id="1543">My mother did that, but she did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And my great aunt, who was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization. </sentence><sentence id="1545">Took me around a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1547">But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1548">That was mostly just ordinary being nice to people. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Oh, I might mention that even though my wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish resistance in their <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1550">That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them also got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the <span class="interior space">attic</span> when, you know, in a <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> where everyone knew everything about everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1551">So, what they did, they waited until it was dark, called the <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span>, had my wife's sister climb on the <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span> with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span> in the <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> and took the whole thing to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So, of course, my sister- in-law had to stay away from the <span class="building">house</span> for at least a week because they kept people in the <span class="building">hospital</span> for at least a week after appendectomy in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And then to bring the man back was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again, they had to be very careful at night. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And there was an asthmatic woman living right across,  3 because those were <span class="building">row houses</span>, and she would always open her <span class="dlf">window</span> during the night to take a breath of fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And they had to wait until she closed the <span class="dlf">window</span> before any movement could occur in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1588">Q: Let's get back to your family. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Your immediate family. </sentence><sentence id="1590">You started to tell me who all was involved in this rescue operation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1594">A: Who, well. </sentence><sentence id="1595">Father Bruno was the driving force. </sentence><sentence id="1596">The leader. </sentence><sentence id="1597">He was also the person having no children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back. </sentence><sentence id="1598">Whether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were smarter than that. </sentence><sentence id="1599">But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you help me, but I will never mention you or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1600">But he got his mother involved, my grandmother, my father, who was a surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="1601">My younger uncle who was a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="1602">My uncle by marriage who was the finance man. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And his three sisters who were nuns. </sentence><sentence id="1604">But, that was only a very small part of the <span class="dlf">network</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1605">Because he had to have a lot more help than that. </sentence><sentence id="1606">So, he got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="1607">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not. </sentence><sentence id="1608">He did all kinds of visits himself to the families where he wanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous story of the University professor in Louvan(ph), <span class="country">Belgium</span> who was a devout Catholic and my uncle went to see him and told him all that was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And the man said, you know, I honestly am not aware of this. </sentence><sentence id="1610">But, my duty as a Christian is to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1611">When are you going to bring me a child? </sentence><sentence id="1612">And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting for him. </sentence><sentence id="1613">He said when he went to <span class="country">Israel</span> after the war, that no one actually shut the <span class="dlf">door</span> on him. </sentence><sentence id="1614">So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a family or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would consider them as being servants. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And they wouldn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="1616">So, there were a few, but I would say not more than five or six such incidents occurred. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And the vast majority of the people were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="1618">But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved eventually. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't know exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three hundred and fifty. </sentence><sentence id="1620">That may be a little too much. </sentence><sentence id="1621">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1622">Because, obviously, for security reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1623">So all the records he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then transferred to a more elaborate ledger. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And so he lost track of a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="1625">So we know for sure of about three hundred and twenty. </sentence><sentence id="1626">And since each child probably had to be moved, one, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably something like a thousand transfers. </sentence><sentence id="1627">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1628">Not, there were sometimes the same families taking different children. </sentence><sentence id="1629">But, most of the time they, you know when there was too much talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new families all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people of his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that. </sentence><sentence id="1631">Like eight or nine, maybe ten. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Close associates. </sentence><sentence id="1633">But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were involved that should not be forgotten or neglected. </sentence><sentence id="1634">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1635"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1682">A: Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to come as a chaplain, in a small <span

there he discovered that there were some blind children, but that most of the occupants there were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Including the director. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And that, you know, it just, he just saw the light immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1686">But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I told you that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> in a busy <span class="dlf">street</span> and he saw people just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone. </sentence><sentence id="1688">And he got closer and he saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black hat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And they were spitting at him and pushing him and that absolutely tore him apart. </sentence><sentence id="1690">But, obviously, being in <span class="country">Germany</span>, he couldn't do a thing about it. </sentence><sentence id="1691">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1692">He couldn't go to the rescue of the man. </sentence><sentence id="1693">If it had been in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, he probably would have, but not in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1694">And he never forgot that incident. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And when he got to <span class="populated place">Hodbomo</span>, that little <span class="building">school</span> for the blind, he said, well, now I realize the full impact of what I saw in <span class="country">Germany</span> and he decided to help. </sentence><sentence id="1696">And he didn't help because they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1697">He helped because they were people. </sentence><sentence id="1698">He said, I don't care if they had been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1699">He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other people, which made it a little easier for him to understand. </sentence><sentence id="1700">But, he was mostly concerned about human beings, about people. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And he said, you know, I have to do something to save those people. </sentence><sentence id="1702">I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people. </sentence><sentence id="1703">They are oppressed. </sentence><sentence id="1704">They are persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="1705">My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them if I can. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Then, at <span class="populated place">Hodbomo</span>, he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer in Liesch(ph) and was the executive director of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> for sickly and destitute children of the archdiocese of <span class="populated place">Liesch</span> whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And they started working together and <span class="populated place">Vandenburg</span> was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno who was, you know, free of family, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Didn't have any children and so on, and was willing to do anything to help. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1710">At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction of the military government. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And he was condemned to three months in <span class="building">jail</span> and he was very happy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And he got out of <span class="building">jail</span> and the Gestapo was waiting outside. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Took him again. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Sent him to <span class="populated place">Bergen Belsen</span> where he finally, well, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after the liberation of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a deadly disease. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network by contacting various people. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Some of the people he already knew from the <span class="populated place">camps</span> because they were helpers in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and this way he was able to place a few children. </sentence><sentence id="1718">But, the first month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to mention that the <span class="building">school</span> became very unsafe because in the <span class="populated place">village</span> people began talking, I'm sure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And talking, as I said, is very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1720">You know, the enemy has ears everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1721">So, the first thing that Father  5 Bruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other places. </sentence><sentence id="1722">So right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1723">So they placed those, the early ones, they placed in <span class="building">convents</span> or, again, in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1724">But even that became unsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids, there were some adults who were also in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and they were arrested and sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1725">One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the name of Lepkifka(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1726">And he escaped but his parents went to and died in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of Vandenburg and...I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1780">A: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="1781">You know, to publicize the work of Vandenburg and, incidentally, of Father Bruno as well. </sentence><sentence id="1782">They knew each other quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1783">As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running the <span class="populated place">camp</span> were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi who was very broad minded at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1784">So, that did a lot to smooth any possible differences that might have occurred under his guidance. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And then you, I think you were asking me how he got to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Well, then people heard about his work and they came with requests, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1787">Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in safety. </sentence><sentence id="1788">And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them. </sentence><sentence id="1789">Eventually after a few months, I think it was in July of "43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a month. </sentence><sentence id="1790">That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> across <span class="country">Belgium</span>, you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring the child. </sentence><sentence id="1791">It was a day and night job. </sentence><sentence id="1792">You know, he worked 18 hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And sometimes more. </sentence><sentence id="1794">He said after the war that he had crisscrossed <span class="country">Belgium</span> 40 times the distance that the bicycle racers do for the tour of <span class="country">Belgium</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="1795">So, that give you an idea of how much bicycling he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1812">Q: What was the involvement of the, or support of the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1814">A: Well, in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, as opposed to some of the <span class="region">eastern European countries</span>, the majority of the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> was helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1815">The Cardinal, the Primate of <span class="country">Belgium</span>, Cardinal VanLouie(ph), had directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious. </sentence><sentence id="1816">But he did several times, issue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this. </sentence><sentence id="1817">I will do, I will not interfere if you do that. </sentence><sentence id="1818">In other words, he was giving them free rein without saying, I want you to save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1819">Because that would immediately have put him in <span class="building">jail</span> right there. </sentence><sentence id="1820">And he couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius XXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my parents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he became the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that the Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the <span class="building">Vatican</span> itself saved  6 around 20,000 Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1822">Including the Grand Rabbi of <span class="populated place">Rome</span> who was at the <span class="building">Vatican</span> during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1823">Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because he didn't do enough. </sentence><sentence id="1824">But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different angles. </sentence><sentence id="1825">It, there is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade the <span class="building">Vatican</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1826">And take the Pope prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1827">He couldn't have done anything any more at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1828">So, in other words, what he did in a concealed way, was probably more useful than if he had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it. </sentence><sentence id="1829">They said he was a friend of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1830">Yes, that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1831">He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> for several years and he really liked the people of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1832">But, he abhorred Nazism. </sentence><sentence id="1833">In fact, one of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without reservation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1854">Q: One of the reasons I'm asking about <span class="country">Belgium</span> in particular is that as we know in many instances, there was a, there were traditional beliefs about Jewish people as traitors, as Christ killers, as whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And the <span class="building">Catholic church</span> was not always as supportive toward helping Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1858">A: Well, you know, let's say that in my <span class="env feature">environment</span>, it wasn't the case. </sentence><sentence id="1859">I cannot speak for all the Belgians, but in my <span class="region">environment</span>, it was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And from what I've been reading and from what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in <span class="country">Holland</span> and in <span class="country">Belgium</span> than, for example, in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Because in <span class="country">Poland</span>, even now, there is still a great hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Let's face it. </sentence><sentence id="1863">That was not the case in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1864">It was not the case in <span class="country">Holland</span>, either. </sentence><sentence id="1865">I want to say here that we never knew exactly how many Jews were in <span class="country">Belgium</span> because people were not registered as to their race, religion, creed or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1866">We figure that there were probably, including all the refugees from the <span class="region">east</span>, in 1938, "39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something like 70,000. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Only about 30,000 survived. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And that was better than <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1869">Where only, I think, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived. </sentence><sentence id="1870">So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were. </sentence><sentence id="1871">They had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Very sad, tragic. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1896">A: As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation. </sentence><sentence id="1897">He did have assistants. </sentence><sentence id="1898">He had people helping him find families. </sentence><sentence id="1899">He had people taking care of false identification papers and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1900">But as far as administration, he was it. </sentence><sentence id="1901">He had all the power and all the responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1902">As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his possessions were on his body. </sentence><sentence id="1903">That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="1904">He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were willing to contribute. </sentence><sentence id="1905">But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the . </sentence><sentence id="1906">The largest <span class="building">bank</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span> whose director we called governor in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1907">Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1908">And he committed himself to contributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="1909">It may not have been quite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Mr.Gallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack Dupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="1911">Another uncle of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And he continued doing that until the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of Nazi thugs who one day came and rang his <span class="dlf">doorbell</span> and said, are you Mr. Gallopan? </sentence><sentence id="1914">And he said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front of his wife. </sentence><sentence id="1916">But the <span class="building">bank</span> continued honoring his commitment all the way to the end of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: Well, there was, of course, the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the initials are the same in English as in French, . </sentence><sentence id="1943">Who was very active  8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1946">Q: What sort of coordination would there have been between this committee and your Uncle's network? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1948">A: The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly. </sentence><sentence id="1949">They were, the <span class="building">CDJ</span> had visitors, or visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various places. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And they would report to the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, but also to Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And the <span class="building">CDJ</span> had a committee that was specifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed. </sentence><sentence id="1952">But that was precisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared. </sentence><sentence id="1953">That there was too much documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any written documentation, without papers. </sentence><sentence id="1955">He would handle only cash, never checks. </sentence><sentence id="1956">Or just, you know, items, like butter or meat or something. </sentence><sentence id="1957">But he would not use things that could be traced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1958">He would meet with the representatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written of their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest. </sentence><sentence id="1959">Then they kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records. </sentence><sentence id="1960">Not that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone. </sentence><sentence id="1961">So, they didn't put his name on the records. </sentence><sentence id="1962">This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I was at that meeting. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And, but that was deliberate. </sentence><sentence id="1965">So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="1967">It wasn't, you know, like in an army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1968">It was a loose cooperation. </sentence><sentence id="1969">They would have meetings that were informal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of the network. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1992">Q: Were there Protestant groups who were also involved in this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1994">A: There was some Protestants but, you know, <span class="country">Belgium</span> has very few Protestants actually. </sentence><sentence id="1995">But there were several Protestant ministers involved. </sentence><sentence id="1996">Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="1997">But to go back to the <span class="building">Catholic clergy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1998">There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="1999">One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know, at the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Namir</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2000">And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences. </sentence><sentence id="2001">Father Bruno did not have a <span class="building">house</span> or an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where he could, you know, which he could call his <span class="building">base</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2002">Until a spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little <span class="building">house</span> she had on the <span class="dlf">square</span> in the middle of <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2003">Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented. </sentence><sentence id="2004">It was a very small <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2005">On the left side was a <span class="building">cafe</span> with horse betting, what do you call that? </sentence><sentence id="2006">You know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="2007">Anyway, horse betting. </sentence><sentence id="2008">On the other side was a of the SS, who was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2009">But that turned out, again, to be a sort of a protection. </sentence><sentence id="2010">Because he was right next to this important Nazi officer and they never ever considered the little <span class="building">house</span> in between there. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And the second coincidence, Father Andre in <span class="populated place">Namir</span> had, on his left, a <span class="building">cafe</span> with horse betting and on his right a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German  9 of work and he deserves all the credit. </sentence><sentence id="2012">I think he is on the list at the <span class="building">museum</span>, also. </sentence><sentence id="2013">Deserves all the credit. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught. </sentence><sentence id="2015">There were many other priests, I won't give you all the names. </sentence><sentence id="2016">First of all, I can't remember them right now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old Belgian family who was a pastor of a <span class="building">church</span> in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2017">He, too, took care of several kids. </sentence><sentence id="2018">He was a friend of my father's actually. </sentence><sentence id="2019">And there were quite a number of other clergymen. </sentence><sentence id="2020">And nuns, of course, too. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Flora Singer was hidden in a <span class="building">convent</span> of nuns. </sentence><sentence id="2022">It wasn't always a pleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share what food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were hidden there. </sentence><sentence id="2024">So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of being cold in their <span class="spatial object">beds</span> because the central heating wasn't working. </sentence><sentence id="2025">There was no coal. </sentence><sentence id="2026">And at that time, central heating was mostly coal fired. </sentence><sentence id="2027">We didn't have any oil. </sentence><sentence id="2028">Even if it had been oil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2029">So, yeah, the conditions were not always pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="2030">But, what's the alternative? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2068">Q: When you mention the scarcity of food or coal, how did your uncle and his colleagues get enough food or clothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2070">A: You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2071">To get enough food and clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and maybe a little more than just enough. </sentence><sentence id="2073">That was only a small part. </sentence><sentence id="2074">I think most of the sources were actually legal sources done illegally. </sentence><sentence id="2075">In other words, there was, for example, the wife of the same professor at the University of Louvan(ph) who at night went, would you believe, to burglarize the office of rationing, the <span class="building">rationing department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2076">And stole reams of food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="2077">Now, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="2078">That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="2079">So, they had to forge food cards. </sentence><sentence id="2080">And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father Bruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards. </sentence><sentence id="2081">Strangely enough, one of the best forgers was an old monk in Father Bruno's <span class="building">abbey</span>, , very, very adorable old father  0 go. </sentence><sentence id="2082">Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen. </sentence><sentence id="2083">But they did. </sentence><sentence id="2084">That was one of his close escapes. </sentence><sentence id="2085">He had a few more, but that was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And, so, ration cards, food stamps, stolen. </sentence><sentence id="2087">It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, it was almost impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2088">You had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were stolen, they were not falsified. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then they filled in the name by hand. </sentence><sentence id="2090">So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult to falsify a card as long as you had one of the <span class="populated place">city</span> rubber stamps or one of those embossing stamps. </sentence><sentence id="2091">That worked. </sentence><sentence id="2092">If you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2093">There was always a problem because, you know, you had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often happen in the <span class="building">SS</span>, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their signature. </sentence><sentence id="2094">You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they could have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the falsification. </sentence><sentence id="2095">So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do you call it, a welfare check. </sentence><sentence id="2096">But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced. </sentence><sentence id="2097">Most of the time the money, as I said, came either from the <span class="building">bank</span> or from private contributions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2158">A: I think all three. </sentence><sentence id="2159">I think it varied on the person. </sentence><sentence id="2160">You may even add one. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Money. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Because many rescuers were given money. </sentence><sentence id="2163">And during the war, money was very tight. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And some people would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2165">But, I would say, all three. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="2167">Charisma from Father Bruno. </sentence><sentence id="2168">And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal for money at times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2180">Q: What other aspects of the logistics were very difficult? </sentence><sentence id="2181"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2184">A: <span class="spatial object">Transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2185">Not to be caught. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Because some kids had to be transported from one end of <span class="country">Belgium</span> to the other. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And even though <span class="country">Belgium</span> is a small <span class="country">country</span>, that still represented 200 miles sometimes and the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> during the war were extremely slow and rare. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And so, it may have taken a whole day to do 200 miles by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2189">You know, getting the children registered in a certain <span class="populated place">municipality</span> with a false ID card. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It was difficult unless you had cooperation from the local authorities. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have help from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular <span class="populated place">municipality</span> would be either scared or maybe even pro-German. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And they would get wind of the thing and immediately the child would have to be moved away. </sentence><sentence id="2193">That was one of the logistical difficulties, too. </sentence><sentence id="2194">And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't just barge in those <span class="building">municipal offices</span> and pick your choice of stamps. </sentence><sentence id="2195">You know, it had to be done extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the employee who would leave the <span class="dlf">door</span> open, for example. </sentence><sentence id="2196">Not lock the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2197">And pretend to go <span class="building">home</span> as usual. </sentence><sentence id="2198">And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and steal. </sentence><sentence id="2199">And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Perhaps less difficult than the food cards. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Logistics. </sentence><sentence id="2202">Getting clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2203">Getting a child registered in <span class="building">school</span> because these kids had to continue their education during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2204">I mean, they couldn't just stay for a year or even two years without any schooling. </sentence><sentence id="2205">So, to have them accepted in <span class="building">school</span> was not all that hard, but, there were <span class="building">school</span> inspections and the authorities, the occupant authorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come from? </sentence><sentence id="2206">So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell the Jewish child to stay <span class="building">home</span> or another child to stay <span class="building">home</span>, or another child. </sentence><sentence id="2207">You know, the teacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2208">And the kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here? </sentence><sentence id="2209">Well, we think he may have a cold, keep him <span class="building">home</span> for a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="2210">So, that would bring the number back to normal. </sentence><sentence id="2211">There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language problem. </sentence><sentence id="2212">Quite a number of these kids were from <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And even the Belgian Jews sometimes spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2214">And one incident occurred in a <span class="building">school</span> in the Waloon(ph) part of <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in the southern part of <span class="country">Belgium</span>, and the school inspector came who was, unfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids was there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French? </sentence><sentence id="2215">And the kid said, yeah, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Alright do you speak other languages? </sentence><sentence id="2217">Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish. </sentence><sentence id="2218">And then the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2219">Oh, Yiddish. [ </sentence><sentence id="2220">sharp intake of breath] That was it. </sentence><sentence id="2221">He gave it away. </sentence><sentence id="2222">But, apparently, as far as I know, the child did not get taken. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately before the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another crew to arrest him and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2224">Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible, you know, passed away without any major trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2225">But, you never know, little children, even though they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control. </sentence><sentence id="2226">A little girl in a <span class="spatial object">train</span> with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice gentleman across from her on the <span class="spatial object">seat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2227">And he said, what's your name? </sentence><sentence id="2228">And she said, do you want my real name or the other? </sentence><sentence id="2229">And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not sympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2230">But, see how, you know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning. </sentence><sentence id="2231"> 2 End of Tape #5  3 Tape #6 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2282">A: Like what happens in an emergency, for example. </sentence><sentence id="2283">Well, there really wasn't any set system. </sentence><sentence id="2284">Again, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you call this person, in that case, you call that person. </sentence><sentence id="2285">It was strictly a word of mouth affair. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And one person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find, please find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such <span class="populated place">town</span>, as soon as he gets there, tell him there is an emergency. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to do in that particular case. </sentence><sentence id="2288">One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl who, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2289">She had not been deported. </sentence><sentence id="2290">She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I have to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were. </sentence><sentence id="2291">Most of the time they were not told. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Obviously, again, for security reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2293">For obvious security reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2294">Well anyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that she took the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two or three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And she was hoping to sell those to pay for her <span class="spatial object">train</span> trip. </sentence><sentence id="2296">She walked into a <span class="spatial object">purse</span>, what do you call those <span class="building">stores</span> where they sell <span class="spatial object">purses</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2297">In French they call them . </sentence><sentence id="2298">Anyway, she went  4 gone. </sentence><sentence id="2299">You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="2300">But, nothing failed, everything worked fine. </sentence><sentence id="2301">What other logistical things were we talking about, again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2322">Q: Well, I'm sort of curious. </sentence><sentence id="2323">This may be a dumb question, but, how did people find Father Bruno and how did he find families to take care of the children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2326">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Well, how did they find Father Bruno? </sentence><sentence id="2328">Occasionally, through the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, but most of the time a simple word of mouth. </sentence><sentence id="2329">Mrs. Abraham on this <span class="interior space">floor</span> would talk to Sarah on the other <span class="interior space">floor</span> and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little daughter and hid her. </sentence><sentence id="2330">You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find you. </sentence><sentence id="2331">Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2332">And they would do that. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Family members. </sentence><sentence id="2334">Sometimes out of the blue. </sentence><sentence id="2335">He would never know where or how those people would have got his name. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally unknown person got my name, who else got my name? </sentence><sentence id="2337">And, as a matter of fact, there was one time when he was going in one of the <span class="dlf">streets</span> in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> to go collect a little boy, I think, and as he was turning the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, he saw a black <span class="spatial object">car</span> stopping in front there and he knew that was the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And they got the boy. </sentence><sentence id="2339">He never had the boy. </sentence><sentence id="2340">He never had this child, didn't put his hand on the child once. </sentence><sentence id="2341">But, they got the child. </sentence><sentence id="2342">That was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="2343">That was one of his most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten the child yet. </sentence><sentence id="2344">But, someone had babbled and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Then, we were talking about emotional issues. </sentence><sentence id="2346">That was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="2347">Many of these children, of course, didn't want to leave their parents. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and they would try to make do. </sentence><sentence id="2349">The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones, it was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle. </sentence><sentence id="2350">Particularly for Father Bruno who had never had any children of his own. </sentence><sentence id="2351">And this was one of the reasons why he was known to keep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2352">In addition to looking for new places, he kept track of the old places. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And one of the most intimate friends of Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers who are now in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And they describe when he would come to the <span class="dlf">farm</span> where they were hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come with green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers. </sentence><sentence id="2355">With green knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that? </sentence><sentence id="2356">Well, I'm not Father Bruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so. </sentence><sentence id="2357">He had several identities. </sentence><sentence id="2358">And his last identity was Msr. </sentence><sentence id="2359">Renau(ph), you know <span class="building">Renau</span> in French means fox. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And it was kind of play on words, of course, because he out-foxed them all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And he said, no, I am Msr. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Renau, you don't know me as Father Bruno any more. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And he would visit them as often as he could. </sentence><sentence id="2364">But, of course, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day. </sentence><sentence id="2365">But, he would keep track precisely for those emotional reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2366">Because he had a charisma and he inspired confidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand. </sentence><sentence id="2367">And they would really get very, very attached to him. </sentence><sentence id="2368">And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed their anxieties. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="2370">He made a big point of that. </sentence><sentence id="2371"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2420">A: Well, again, it's word of mouth. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And occasionally, as we said before, by the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, the Committee for the Defense of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2422">Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk to those people. </sentence><sentence id="2423">Like the University professor I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="2424">He would just go in their <span class="building">house</span> and say, I want you to help. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say no. </sentence><sentence id="2426">You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do is say, now, you're going to have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2427">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="2428">You know. </sentence><sentence id="2429">Both my sister and my brother and I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this. </sentence><sentence id="2430">And we would do it. </sentence><sentence id="2431">Even if we had been very bad with our parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2579">A: Right, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="2580">It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving parents, if there were any. </sentence><sentence id="2581">To find surviving family. </sentence><sentence id="2582">Uncles, cousins, if there were any. </sentence><sentence id="2583">And to find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available. </sentence><sentence id="2584">Some of the kids, even though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored them during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2585">That became a little difficult because the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, after the war, tried to gather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which is fine, I mean, it was a legitimate concern of them. </sentence><sentence id="2586">The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a <span class="building">home</span> for Jewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="2587">And some members of the <span class="building">CDJ</span> wanted some of the kids to go there. </sentence><sentence id="2588">But Father Bruno said, I don't want that. </sentence><sentence id="2589">I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want them to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them religion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to practice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so. </sentence><sentence id="2590">And that was one of the points of contention. </sentence><sentence id="2591">Unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="2592">Another point of contention was some of the relatives who wanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And I have, unfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my younger uncle's <span class="building">house</span> the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was staying there, without permission from anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2594">Not even the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2595">You know. </sentence><sentence id="2596">They just came and took the child. </sentence><sentence id="2597">Not knowing if the parents were alive or what. </sentence><sentence id="2598">They just wanted the kid. </sentence><sentence id="2599">And they didn't even live in the same <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2600">There were a few unpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of these children went pretty smoothly. </sentence><sentence id="2601">Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who made a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the <span class="building">CDJ</span> or the, I forget the new name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the <span class="building">CDJ</span>, it's the same. </sentence><sentence id="2602"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
