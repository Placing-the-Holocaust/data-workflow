<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: And the other <span class="interior space">floors</span> were either rented as a whole, or in a couple instances, I think divided into two <span class="interior space">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father owned the <span class="building">building</span>, and we had a teeny <span class="dlf">garden</span> in the front, and a slightly larger one in the back. </sentence><sentence id="51">And my -- I had an old -- still have an older sister, an older brother, and I'm the baby in the family. </sentence><sentence id="52">I would say that my parents belonged to what one would call a middle class. </sentence><sentence id="53">And as I said, the whole time that I lived in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> was in this <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: And when you said that your father served in World War I, could you say a bit more about his experiences during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: My father went in in 1914, was assigned as a replacement on the <span class="region">western front</span>, and for a time was in the <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, with a pair of field glasses, to locate where their shells were fa -- were landing, from their artillery, to correct that. </sentence><sentence id="62">He was promoted to noncommissioned officer. </sentence><sentence id="63">And when the battalion commander put him in for a field commission, the regimental commander turned it down. </sentence><sentence id="64">As he explained, that is the regimental commander, this is a <span class="building">Prussian guard reserve regiment</span>, and we cannot have a Jewish officer. </sentence><sentence id="65">Subsequently, I believe in 1916, the <span class="building">unit</span> was transferred to the <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">And in the fighting before <span class="populated place">Riga</span>, and what is today <span class="country">Latvia</span>, my father was badly wounded in the arm. </sentence><sentence id="67">And since it was his right arm, he could no longer fire a weapon. </sentence><sentence id="68">So that after he recovered, they recalled that he had  Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 legal training, and made him the legal officer, the chief legal officer of one of these <span class="region">scratch divisions</span> put together for occupation duty in the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">And he spent -- but he was, by this time, promoted, and was what the Germans call a Rittmeister, and that would be the equivalent of a captain in the American army. </sentence><sentence id="70">And he served that way until demobilization in 1918. </sentence><sentence id="71">And then, as I said, instead of going back into the <span class="building">judiciary</span>, transferred to the new <span class="building">German national ministry of finance</span>, something that <span class="country">Germany</span> had not had between 1871 and 1919. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="85">If you think of your extended family, were there noteworthy personalities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: I suppose there were two. </sentence><sentence id="89">My grandfather on mother's side was a judge in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span>, and came to be what the Germans called an <span class="building">Oberlandesgerichtshof</span>, which would be the equivalent of a associate judge in the <span class="building">state supreme court</span> in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">And he was not promoted to chief judge, because he would have had to convert, and he was not about to do that, when it was offered to him. </sentence><sentence id="91">A slightly more distant relative lived not in <span class="country">Prussia</span>, as my grandfather did, but in the Grand Duchy <span class="populated place">Oldenburg</span>, which is in <span class="region">northwest Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">And before the first World War, he was on the <span class="building">top court</span> of <span class="populated place">Oldenburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And when the chief justice of <span class="populated place">Oldenburg</span> died, they discovered to their horror -- that is, the grand duke, and the minister of justice, that the next senior judge was a Roman Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="94">And in that  Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 part of <span class="country">Germany</span>, which is traditionally overwhelmingly Protestant, they did not think that that would work very well. </sentence><sentence id="95">The next senior judge was a Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="96">But by the time we're talking about, 1912, or thereabouts, <span class="populated place">Oldenburg</span>, because of <span class="dlf">port</span> and industrial development had a substantial Catholic minority. </sentence><sentence id="97">I don't know what the percentage would be, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was 10 - 15 percent. </sentence><sentence id="98">And the grand duke, and the minister of ju -- prime minister and minister of justice were concerned that if they obviously passed over a Catholic, to appoint a Protestant, this Catholic minority would be very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="99">So they decided to pass over both of them. </sentence><sentence id="100">And the last chief justice of the <span class="populated place">Grand Duchy of Oldenburg</span> was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="101">I've always thought as a historian, that this is an example how people can trap themselves into absolute stupidity, because of course, this had nothing to do with qualifications, politics, or anything of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was just that they couldn't have a Catholic chief justice, and they couldn't annoy the Catholic minority, by putting in the next, so I guess they annoyed them all, by arranging to have a Jewish chief justice as the last chief justice of the <span class="populated place">Grand Duchy</span>. [ </sentence><sentence id="103">technical interruption] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Can I-- can I ask you about experiences with anti-Semitism? </sentence><sentence id="122">With social anti- Semitism, and you know, like I mean, pre "33? </sentence><sentence id="123">Because you're already touching on it, like you know, the very fact that somebody would have to convert to become --  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="127"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 you know, to take on a position is a -- of course, you know, pointing to ingrained anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="128">I mean, the <span class="spatial object">camera</span> is off right now, I would -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Oh, I see, okay. </sentence><sentence id="130">Yeah, well we can talk about -- I'll talk about that briefly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Okay, all right. </sentence><sentence id="134">And was your family observing? </sentence><sentence id="135">Did your family have strong ties into the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: My family belonged to the -- what in <span class="country">Germany</span> would be called the <span class="building">Reform Jewish congregation</span> in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, though by American standards, I believe these would be considered a <span class="building">Conservative congregation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And we went on the high holidays, occasionally on other times. </sentence><sentence id="141">We celebrated Friday evenings regularly at <span class="building">home</span>; you know, Passover, Chanukah, and other such events, so that -- and in time each of us went to a <span class="building">religious school</span> for some training. </sentence><sentence id="142">So, there was no doubt about the affiliation of the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: How many Jews lived in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> at the time, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> at the time -- excuse me -- was a <span class="populated place">city</span> of about half a million, and there about 5,500 roughly, just over one percent Jewish community there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: And did your family have any experience with anti-Semitism before 1933? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, what one has to keep in mind is that <span class="country">Germany</span> from 1871, until 1919, was a <span class="region">federal state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">On the <span class="region">national level</span>, there were not legal regulations specifically affecting Jews. </sentence><sentence id="155">But the <span class="region">states</span> that made up <span class="country">Germany</span>, had regu -- their own  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 regulations. </sentence><sentence id="156">So that in <span class="country">Prussia</span>, which is where the majority of Jews lived, and where my parents lived, no Jew could be an officer in the army. </sentence><sentence id="157">They all did their military duty, but they knew ahead of time they could -- there were no such things as commissioned Jews. </sentence><sentence id="158">Whereas in <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>, the did it differently. </sentence><sentence id="159">There were Jews among the Bavarian officer corps. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was also a rule in <span class="country">Prussia</span>, and I'm talking not about discrimination now, I'm talking about legally established regulations. </sentence><sentence id="161">Jews could not hold administrative positions. </sentence><sentence id="162">So that when my father grew up, he knew he could never be postmaster of the <span class="populated place">town</span> where he lived. </sentence><sentence id="163">In the case of my grandfather, in other words, if he was going to be the chief justice, as the king of <span class="country">Prussia</span> also, and pro-- <span class="country">Germany</span> had agreed, being the chief jus -- of the justices meant administrative responsibilities, and he declined to convert to Christianity in order to accept that position. </sentence><sentence id="164">We tend to forget in this <span class="country">country</span> that legal disabilities in Europe lasted very long. </sentence><sentence id="165">In <span class="country">England</span>, the last major legal disabilities on Catholics and Jews don't disappear until the 1880s. </sentence><sentence id="166">In <span class="country">Germany</span> the last legal disabilities end in 1919, because they were on the <span class="region">state level</span>, not the <span class="region">national level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">When my father was in the military, it was very clear as -- as I said, you could not be an officer in this one <span class="building">unit</span>, and then later became an officer in a different <span class="building">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">There was also, of course, some discrimination. </sentence><sentence id="169">But since I was not alive and adult at the time, I did not really run into those sorts of things until after I became five,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 six, seven years old, and was going to <span class="building">school</span>, and noticed what was being done to Jews, and what was discussed at <span class="building">home</span> about these things. </sentence><sentence id="170">After the -- Hitler became chancellor in 1933, there was, as I said, on the one hand, until 1919, legal disabilities, I guess you would call them, and then, at the same time, some discrimination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: What is your -- what is your -- what are your fondest memories of your childhood in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: The fondest memories, I guess, are associated in part with a pet white mouse that I greatly enjoyed, and that became totally tame. </sentence><sentence id="194">And th-th -- what was also important for me was that while Jews could not go to the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span>, I couldn't learn how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="195">And there were other such restrictions, for reasons that I've never figured out. </sentence><sentence id="196">There were, at least in those days, no prohibitions on Jews going to the <span class="building">zoo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">And <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> had -- and still has, to the best of my knowledge, a very large, very nice <span class="building">zoo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I enjoyed going there and watching the animals, and I particularly enjoyed the arrangement they had, where for a very small fee, the kids up to a certain weight -- weight, could ride on a turtle. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I thought that riding on a <span class="spatial object">Galapagos turtle</span> was really very much a -- a wonderful thing. </sentence><sentence id="200">Another thing that I enjoyed as a kid, was that great aunt and uncle, who lived in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span>, outside <span class="populated place">Essen</span>, had on their <span class="dlf">property</span> -- small <span class="dlf">estate</span>, I guess you would call it, two royal  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 <span class="spatial object">cranes</span> that walked around. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I suspect today, because I was their height, they liked to walk around with me. </sentence><sentence id="202">And the idea of walking around with two <span class="spatial object">cranes</span> that wandered around with me, I thought was really very special and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="203">And since they had also a tennis court where they and guests played tennis, the three of us would sometimes walk over there and watch people play tennis. </sentence><sentence id="204">Unfortunately, nobody had sense enough to take a picture, but I-- I just thought that walking around with two tall <span class="spatial object">cranes</span>, exactly my height, and not on a leash or anything, but that just decided that they would walk around with me, was really very, very special. </sentence><sentence id="205">I also very much enjoyed this grandfather, who by this time had retired from being a judge. </sentence><sentence id="206">We would go to a <span class="env feature">woods</span> near <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> where they lived, and feed what were essentially tame deer. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I thought that that was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="208">The other thing he would do, which was probably not nice for him, but for me, was there was a <span class="dlf">switching yard</span>, where there were those small <span class="spatial object">steam engines</span> that put <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="209">And we'd go puff puff. </sentence><sentence id="210">Well, we were under the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> that we walked on, and we would disappear in the smoke, and then reappear. </sentence><sentence id="211">And that too, I thought was really great, good fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="232">Well, you touched already, about the changes that came with 1933. </sentence><sentence id="233">I mean, how did you, as a child, experience the onset of national socialism in  ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="234">I mean, how and when did Nazi rule begin to impact your everyday life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Well, it began to impact my everyday life in two ways when I started <span class="building">school</span> in deg34. </sentence><sentence id="240">In the <span class="building">school</span> itself, there were nasty comments from other kids. </sentence><sentence id="241">In the <span class="country">Germany</span> of the time, all kids went to gender segregated <span class="building">public schools</span> for four years. </sentence><sentence id="242">And while in the first part of that, that is, deg34, deg35, ? </sentence><sentence id="243">36, the teacher I have [indecipherable] kind of restrained, I think it would be best to say, other kids. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was rather unpleasant, and in the later years in the <span class="building">grade school</span>, the kids would beat up on me, and I would have to try to make my way <span class="building">home</span> by devious ways, because I didn't want to get beaten up so badly. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I carried with me for the next 10 - 20 years, a tendency to get very bad nosebleeds. </sentence><sentence id="246">In 1934, when my father was tossed out of his job -- he had been allowed to keep it, in the <span class="building">local office</span> of the <span class="building">ministry of finance</span>, because he was front veteran at the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="247">But when President Hindenburg died in, I believe it's August of "34, then those people were also tossed out. </sentence><sentence id="248">So he normal -- no longer went to work, off every morning, and instead d-decided to earn his living by what the Germans call a devisen berauter, a foreign exchange advisor, and in practice what it meant was that because of his background, he understood the constantly changing regulations on what people leaving <span class="country">Germany</span> could take with them. </sentence><sentence id="249">And so, our <span class="interior space">living room</span> was converted into his  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 <span class="building">office</span>, where he met clients. </sentence><sentence id="250">And the <span class="interior space">front hall</span>, where you came into the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, became a <span class="interior space">waiting room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">In other words, people would wait there, and then see my father. </sentence><sentence id="252">So the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> changed in a way, and Dad did this -- that is to say, did this kind of work from 1934 until my parents left <span class="country">Germany</span> in the spring of "39. </sentence><sentence id="253">And the fact that we didn't have a <span class="interior space">living room</span> any more, and the <span class="interior space">front hall</span> wasn't available, in a sense, certainly made a change in life. </sentence><sentence id="254">But the main change wa -- I would say, a sense of -- that the <span class="country">country</span> didn't want you there, and that other kids were very unfriendly -- with a few exceptions, not all. </sentence><sentence id="255">And my brother, a year and a half older, found this an impossible situation. </sentence><sentence id="256">My parents took him out of <span class="building">school</span>, sent him to live with a family in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and he went to <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="257">So that during the school year, my brother was not at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">He was, as I said, living in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="259">Evidently, from what I gathered from my sister, she did not have -- I mean, not that everybody was friendly with her, but she didn't have that kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="260">It got substantially worse after a couple of years, because we were told that the teacher that -- whom I mentioned, was ill, and retired. </sentence><sentence id="261">My parents told me many years later that he had been a Quaker, and had been fired. </sentence><sentence id="262">And so, we got another teacher, who did not restrain the kids. </sentence><sentence id="263">So that was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Which -- which grade was this? </sentence><sentence id="265">Were you third grade, fourth grade? </sentence><sentence id="266"> Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: This was the third and fourth grade. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then, my parents were talking about leaving the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">And first thought that they would li -- stay out their lives in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but th -- there was no future for the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="270">We had relatives in this <span class="country">country</span>, and they applied for quota numbers to come to this <span class="country">country</span>, and in fact sent us to start learning English. </sentence><sentence id="271">There were two elderly ladies, sisters, who lived in <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, who were from <span class="country">England</span>, and we went -- started to learn English from them. </sentence><sentence id="272">Though I have to admit that I was probably more intrigued by their parrot than th -- by their English lessons. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then in the -- after the four years, in the <span class="country">Germany</span> of the time, you went to -- either you stayed, or you went to what was essentially a university preparatory system, a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, and I moved to that. </sentence><sentence id="274">And there we started English. </sentence><sentence id="275">And so I learned a little English there. </sentence><sentence id="276">But of course, then in November "38, I was kicked out. </sentence><sentence id="277">But I started learning English more systematically in <span class="building">school</span> in 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="940">And so I wrote my first seminar paper on the crisis of a -- eastern crisis of 1876. </sentence><sentence id="941">But I discovered very quickly in working with ro --

I ended up doing. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Furthermore, as Lysinger(ph) explained to me that there were two other reasons to film, occasionally selectively, but generally throughout, was that you spend your money on filming, not on selecting, which meant that you could produce much more. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And there's no question that this helped us sustain the program, because as Professor Hale(ph), who was the third head of the committee, but headed it longer than anybody else, told me that if you go to a <span class="building">foundation</span> for microfilm, they're not much interested. </sentence><sentence id="1253">But if you can tell them that for 30 or 35,000 dollars a year, you can turn a million frames into the <span class="building">National Archives</span>, they are somewhat more interested. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1254">The other thing that Lysinger(ph) explained to me, that I was barely conscious of from my earlier work with the <span

were a lot more important than requisitions for paper clips. </sentence><sentence id="1255">And therefore, we needed to film, in part for access, to be sure, which was the original concept of the

</sentence><sentence id="1259">But, as I said, Lysinger(ph) really put these things to me in a way so that I -- when I set this whole thing up, we did a teeny bit of selective, but mostly filming throughout, and that then continued thereafter, long after I was out of it on the -- teaching in <span class="region">Kentucky</span> or in <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1260">But that meant in that -- that it was afterwards possible for the army and the project to cooperate. </sentence><sentence id="1261">When the army started putting money in, especially for the filming of the military records, they would contract with a micor -- with a -- for the microfilming, and the committee's professional people would do the descriptions. </sentence><sentence id="1262">So that when it was all over, of the material that was at one time in <span class="populated place">Alexandria</span>, let me put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Somewheres

importance of filming throughout, because while lots of people are increasingly thinking about what to do about the fact that the Holocaust survivors are either dead or not going to be with us very much longer, the papers, the records of the Holocaust era, are disappearing too. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Either physically, for the paper, or electronically if they're electronic records.

high density engraving on plates, than I was when we started. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And the other policy that I insisted on at the beginning, and that to the best of my knowledge was followed for -- through the rest of the project, was that where the western allies had not acquired what I would call the -- the top level records -- and the two examples that I recall very distinctly were the

id="1272">And later on, when the army was beginning to run out of money for filming, I urged them, and I believe they followed, on a somewhat similar basis. </sentence><sentence id="1273">That is to say, all the top level military records were filmed. </sentence><sentence id="1274">But when they had to choose among the division records, after a while, I told them all the <span

class="Question"><p><sentence id="1278">Q: Yet, if you were to summarize, what did the microfilming project achieve? </sentence><sentence id="1279">What does it mean for scholarship, just to get that idea across? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1280">A: Well, it means that there is access, now and into the future, of an enormous quantity of German records from the 1930s and 40s, on essentially all aspects of events, and that can be accessed in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, that can be accessed elsewheres by either purchase or borrowing. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And that for one of the most dramatic <span class="region">areas</span> of world history, and the largest war ever fought that we know about, and the horrendous catastrophe of the Holocaust, there are records that people who are interested can have access to, essentially today, without restrictions, and that they can make the most of. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And that there was no opportunity, as there was after the first World War, for the postwar German government to restrict access, even if it wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I'm not suggesting that with certain exceptions, the German postwar government has wanted to, but needless to say, in the 1950s, nobody knew this, and we were looking at the past experience, which people had, as opposed to the future experience, which for very good reasons, people hadn't had yet. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And there was one other aspect to this that I think is important, and that is, it created, if you will, a kind of precedent. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Why keep the records of <span class="country">country</span> X closed, if those of <span class="country">country</span> Y

the declassification, and then microfilming of German records has had for the opening of other records. </sentence><sentence id="1288">There is one final point that's closely related to this, I would argue, and that is that those who might have preferred closure of German records in postwar <span class="country">Germany</span>, realistically didn't have a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1289">And the dramatic example of this that I would site, is the German scholar Derscha(ph), who wanted access to some personnel records of the <span class="building">German foreign ministry</span>, which were denied to him. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And who then discovered that they were on microfilm in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1291">The -- the possibilities, in other words, and the temptations simply haven't been there. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And while I don't want this to be read as a general attack, cause as I said, the -- the

the Iron Guard, the government and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And there are some pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="1639">But it's when the dictator of <span class="country">Romania</span>, Antonescu meets with Hitler personally on the 12" of June, 1941, and Hitler tells him that after -- that when the newly <span class="region">occupied territories</span> fall under German and Romanian control, all the Jews there are to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And it is then that the Romanians change. </sentence><sentence id="1641">And having killed and persecuted lots of Jews before, and having killed maybe a couple  Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 thousand, in the following two years they kill over 400,000. </sentence><sentence id="1642">I would suggest that there is a difference when a degree becomes a differ -- difference in kind. </sentence><sentence id="1643">That aspect, you see, I -- I see differently from most. </sentence><sentence id="1644">The other aspect which I see differently from most is that people keep yakking about killing the Jews in <span class="country">Europe</span>, and being unwilling to face up to Hitler's view that all on earth needed to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1645">When the Germans killed the Jews in the <span class="region">Dodecanese islands</span> in the <span class="env feature">Aegean</span>, they are living in what by German definition is a part of <span class="region">Asia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1646">When they attach a killing squad to Rommel's <span class="building">headquarters</span> in <span class="region">north Africa</span>, at least on my atlas, neither <span class="country">Egypt</span> nor <span class="country">Palestine</span> is a part of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1647">And what people simply don't want to face up to is that Hitler personally at great length explained to the grand ra -- mufti of <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, that Jews on the whole <span class="env feature">earth</span> have to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1648">But people find that too frightening, I guess, to think about. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And s-so therefore, they keep talking about Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, and ignore the fact that it was the military operations of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, <span class="country">Great Britain</span> and the <span class="country">United States</span> that essentially confined a worldwide scheme, to <span class="region">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1650">So there are some issues there, which I continue to see differently from most. </sentence><sentence id="1651">The other -- another <span class="region">area</span>, I guess where -- although it's only been explicit once, I see it differently from many, not all, is on the German military leadership of the second World War, which I would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent, when others  Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 think was competent. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And that it has become a kind of cliche, that they always disagreed with Hitler, and they were right and he was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And usually they agreed with him, and very often when they disagreed, he was as often right as they were. </sentence><sentence id="1654">In the Pacific war, I have, for many years been intrigued by the total neglect and the discussion of the Japanese plans of which we knew, to kill all allied prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And of the Japanese agreement at the top, that when the allies invaded the <span class="region">home islands</span>, Japanese casualties would be 20 million. </sentence><sentence id="1656">It may well be, I have often thought, that the Japanese award in the 60s, of the highest decoration to a foreigner, to General LeMay, who commanded the assault on -- air assault on the <span class="region">home islands</span>, including the great fire raid on <span class="populated place">Tokyo</span>, and the atomic bombs. </sentence><sentence id="1657">Perhaps they realized that 150,000 is considerably smaller number than 20 million, but many of my colleagues in American history cannot get that arithmetic as straight as evidently the Japanese have. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: There are two quite separate answers to that. </sentence><sentence id="1704">I have taught the Holocaust as a part of <span class="region">modern Europe</span>, modern German, and World War II history as long as I've taught, starting, ironically, back in 1954. </sentence><sentence id="1705">The first time I have taught a course  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg (r) March 13, 2012 entitled Holocaust was here at <span class="populated place">Chapel Hill</span>, and that would have been, I would say a little -- 20, or a little over 20 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1706">The -- the <span class="building">history department</span> at this <span class="building">university</span> has a program of undergraduate seminars called, History 90s, because that's their number in the catalog. </sentence><sentence id="1707">These are limited to 15. </sentence><sentence id="1708">I introduced a History 90 on the Holocaust, which was the first Holocaust taught -- ever taught here, around 20 years ago, or a little more. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And it always filled. </sentence><sentence id="1710">But, at the same time, I had lots of other teaching responsibilities, and the survey courses; Western Civ, the World since 1945, a big course I introduced. </sentence><sentence id="1711">German history, European 20" century. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So I would teach this, if you will, one <span class="building">Holocaust seminar</span> for undergraduates, over and o --anumber of times over the years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1724">Q: And what were the reactions to this new course? </sentence><sentence id="1725">I mean, what -- how did the students react to it, how did other faculty react to it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A: Well, other faculty reacted to it in a normal way that a committee has to approve <span class="spatial object">courses</span>, and they did. </sentence><sentence id="1729">With more or less enthusiasm, I frankly don't know, because that is essentially a routine operation. </sentence><sentence id="1730">The students filled it up every time, and then when it got to 15, it was closed, because that was the way that type of course is set up in the <span class="building">department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And while once or twice, under very special conditions, with appropriate paperwork, we got a 16" student in. </sentence><sentence id="1732">But these were never big <span class="building">lecture classes</span> of any

class="building">American high schools</span> and <span class="building">colleges</span>, or do you think that interest might wane at some point? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1736">Or, put differently, what challenges do you see for Holocaust education in the future? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1737">A: Well, i-it seems to me, I don't really know enough about secondary education, and I know that it is taught in many insto -- <span class="building">institu -- high schools</span> in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And that in many <span class="country">states</span> there are requirements in this <span class="dlf">field</span>, and in many <span class="region">states</span> efforts are made to prepare teachers, that is <span class="building">public school</span> teachers, properly, so they can do this. </sentence><sentence id="1739">I do know a little bit ki-- more about the <span class="building">college</span> and university system, and there it is reasonably well established, I would argue, for a couple of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1740">One of them is that there are many scholars who have worked in the field, who accept positions in modern European or modern German history, and who are interested in offering a course on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And the other side of this, very closely related to this, is that <span class="building">departments</span> who need large numbers of enrollments, to offset courses they need to offer, in things like medieval history, where they're not going to get large numbers of students, but need to offer them, are interested in the fact that <span class="spatial object">Holocaust courses</span> are always filled. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And I know, both from my own PhDs around the <span class="country">country</span>, and others, that when there is a course offered, the <span class="spatial object">chairs</span> are filled. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And if you ask, well, why are the <span class="spatial object">chairs</span> filled, it is not because these  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 courses are required. </sentence><sentence id="1744">It is -- they are filled because there is a general public interest, and students are interested. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Whether it satisfies a particular degree requirement or not, or can be used as one of a vast number of courses that would fulfill a particular requirement, th-the reality is that the students go to the courses on the Holocaust because they have an interest. </sentence><sentence id="1746">They've heard about this, they want to know something about it. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And if it's offered, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And the other side of this is that department chairs know that if one of their faculty members is going to offer a course, it's going to be full. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And so, because of the interest out there, not because of a requirement that students take it. </sentence><sentence id="1750">Under those circumstances, I would argue that the <span class="dlf">field</span> is reasonably well established. </sentence><sentence id="1751">That doesn't mean that there are no issues or problems, and I would suggest that the future here depends heavily on faculty members being honest and forthright about a differentiation between the Holocaust and other genocides. </sentence><sentence id="1752">That doesn't mean that one is a hierarchy of better or worse, but what I would argue is a sense of differentia -- differentiation. </sentence><sentence id="1753">And it is in this regard that the issue I just alluded to, that is to say where I differ with many in this, the concept of a worldwide killing program. </sentence><sentence id="1754">All other genocides of which we know, are geographically defined. </sentence><sentence id="1755">The Turks wanted to kill Armenians in <span class="country">Armenia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1756">They had not the slightest interest in Armenians who had emigrated to <span class="country">France</span> or <span class="country">Argentina</span> or the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1757">The <span class="building">UstaSe</span> in World War II <span class="country">Croatia</span> wanted to  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg (tm) March 13, 2012 kill Serbs who lived in <span class="country">Croatia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1758">The fact that there are lots of Serbs living -- or people of Serb descent living in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>, they assumed they wouldn't like when they hear about this, but there was no particular interest in going to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> to kill people of Serb background. </sentence><sentence id="1759">One of the major differentiations I would argue, between the Holocaust and all other known forms of genocide, was the concept of a worldwide program. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And I think that in the future, as the time in which the Holocaust occurred, recedes further and further into the past, and other genocides, like the one in <span class="country">Rwanda</span>, are chronologically seen 50 or a hundred years from now, as being about the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1761">I think that unless those who do work on the Holocaust, both in their research and in their teaching, are ho-honest about differentiations, not that one is worse than another; people are dead whether they are killed in one or the other, but that the conceptualization of this was different, and novel in its own way, as well as the implementation on an industrial scale. </sentence><sentence id="1762">I think that is an issue that the teaching of the Holocaust, at the <span class="building">college</span> and <span class="building">university</span> level in the future, has to -- what to engage, the reality as a future generation of students looks back on a variety of mass killings, none of which was better or worse than the other mass killings, but out of which group, the Holocaust stands apart. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Not above, not below, but apart, in a category by itself. </sentence><sentence id="1764"> Interview with Gerhard Weinberg " March 13, 2012 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1795">Q: Dr. Weinberg, as you look back on your successful and eventful life, what do you remember as the most exciting moments of your scholarly career? </sentence><sentence id="1796">Like a discovery, recognition and insight, which moment do you remember as particularly exciting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1799">A: Well, I'm not sure that I remember one more than another. </sentence><sentence id="1800">I was very excited when I got my first opportunity to teach at the <span class="building">University of Chicago</span>, because I had not had that opportunity before, at a college university level. </sentence><sentence id="1801">I was quite excited when I, in the summer of "58, I looked at what turned out to be not a draft of "Mein Kampf," but this other book of Hitler's which, since I was working on German foreign policy, here was Adolf himself writing on foreign policy. </sentence><sentence id="1802">I thought that that was a very good coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And I guess the other moment was when my wife Janet took a picture of me at the <span class="building">post office</span>, when I was sending to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>, in a huge <span class="spatial object">crate</span>, two copies of the World War II book manuscript. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1809">Q: And what did you find most rewarding, most gratifying in being a scholar and a teacher? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1811">A: The response of students. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I like my students, even the ones that didn't do so well. </sentence><sentence id="1813">But I like getting a sense of looking at students while I was speaking, when their faces sort of lit up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1814">Oh, I get that. </sentence><sentence id="1815">And I was very pleased to have a succession of graduate students who moved forward in their graduate work, and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13, 2012 none of whom is unemployed today. </sentence><sentence id="1816">And a--a majority of whom went into academic careers, but a substantial number into other careers in the government, and in <span class="building">archives</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1817">And that is always very interesting, because of course, they learn more about the subject they're working on than I ever had learned. </sentence><sentence id="1818">And it was very interesting to have this combination of individuals, and their -- their relationship with me, both then and after they had finished, a-and to see other people make new discoveries, this -- find new connections, and then go forth into the world -- the academic or the government world, and make successful careers for themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1828">Q: Is there anything you wish to add to this interview? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: Well, perhaps I should mention the two <span class="building">monuments</span> that aren't up, that I think should be up. </sentence><sentence

they found a bunch of records. </sentence><sentence id="1835">And those records, it turned out, were the records of the <span class="region">area</span>, <span class="region">military area</span> district horse draft board. </sentence><sentence id="1836">We forget today that in Europe, until World War, and into World War II, governments drafted not just people, but also horses. </sentence><sentence id="1837">The question then arose, what's to be done with these  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard Weinberg ia March 13, 2012 records? </sentence><sentence id="1838">The Austrians said, well, these were Austrian horses, and the records were in <span class="country">Austria</span>, and the records should go to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, and if the Germans want to look at them, they're welcome. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And the Germans said, oh, but these are German records, they were created by our <span class="building">agency</span>, the horses are all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1840">The records should go to the <span class="building">military archive</span> in <span class="populated place">Freiburg</span>, and if the Austrians want to use them, they're welcome. </sentence><sentence id="1841">When there are legal questions in the American military, they go to the Judge Advocate General's office in the <span class="building">Pentagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1842">And the lawyers there decided uh-uh, these are American records, they go to <span class="populated place">Alexandria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1843">Which is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1844">But because they were American records, they naturally fall under American archive law. </sentence><sentence id="1845">And that meant, among other th -- two things. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Number one, that American privacy rules would apply to them, and we applied them in our microfilming. </sentence><sentence id="1847">But it also means that there would be the system of records disposal. </sentence><sentence id="1848">The the <span class="building">National Archives</span> would present to a joint committee of <span class="building">House</span> and <span class="building">Senate</span>, disposal schedules from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="1849">These records go to the <span class="building">National Archives</span>, these records go to the <span class="building">regional archive</span> in <span class="populated place">Atlanta</span>, or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="1850">These records get destroyed, nobody needs them. </sentence><sentence id="1851">These records are sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>, the federal republic. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And if the <span class="building">congressional joint committee</span> agreed, as I'm informed it generally did, that's how they got there. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And I have therefore been long of the opinion, both orally and in print, that the Germans should put up at least a plaque in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Gerhard <span class="populated place">Weinberg</span> ia March 13, 2012 honor of the Austrian horses who got them their records back. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Seems to me only reasonable. </sentence><sentence id="1855">The Brits need to put up a plaque, or a monument of some sort, to the Duchess of Windsor, because if she had not, as Wallace Simpson, put her sites on the man, the Prince of Wales who became Edward the eighth, and who abdicated in order to marry her, the British would have been stuck with him, whether he married someone else, or remained unmarried, for the rest of his life. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And sparing the British from having him as king during World War II, is something that I've long argued that people in <span class="country">Great Britain</span> ought to acknowledge by some kind of plaque, or other dedicated thing. </sentence><sentence id="1857">In my own work in the British records, it is very clear that in 1940, thi -- by this time, the Duke of Windsor, because of course, he had abdicated before, and George the sixth was king, and his wife, the Duchess of Windsor were, if not very strongly pro-German, inclined in that direction. </sentence><sentence id="1858">They had no sense of what really was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And at a time when <span class="country">Britain</span> was being assaulted from the <span class="env feature">air</span>, their main concern was the fate of their <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> in the <span class="interior space">Paris apartment</span>, and whether one of his junior aids could get an exemption from the British draft. </sentence><sentence id="1860">They shipped him off to the <span class="country">Bahamas</span>, but this was not the kind of person that the <span class="country">country</span> needed in its great hour of need, and people tend to forget that George the sixth, who became king and was king through the whole war, into the beginning of the 50s, when he died, was a man who had then, on a British This was somebody who had a connection to the <span class="country">country</span>, it was thought that Edward the eighth never did have. </sentence><sentence id="1861">And so, since she was the one who took the initiative to arrange -- or have it arranged, let me put it that way, that George the sixth became king, I think the Brits owe him one -- owe her one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
