Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their <span class="dlf">doors</span> because what they preached mostly in the <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">When they come <span class="building">home</span> and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.(c). </sentence><sentence id="6">Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> at this point?A. No, we were aware very little of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="8">Q. How large was your town?A. Our <span class="populated place">town</span> had about close to 10,000 population. </sentence><sentence id="9">4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent. </sentence><sentence id="10">Q. Business and that was fairly integrated?A. Right. </sentence><sentence id="11">Q.

What about activities in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, cultural activities, religion, your father's political -- A. All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="38">You were afraid even to go out into the <span class="dlf">street</span> during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come <span class="building">home</span>, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could. </sentence><sentence id="39">They used to come in every day to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and do what they want to, anda lot of people got killed. </sentence><sentence id="40">If they didn't like somebody, they just killed them in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">It didn't make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="42">Os Did you see that?A. Oh, sure, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="43">I remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="44">He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Sam Spiegal a May 3, 1995 to call him. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was a very, very cruel man. </sentence><sentence id="46">He just came out. </sentence><sentence id="47">I remember right near our <span class="building">house</span> there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">We were sitting inside. </sentence><sentence id="49">We were afraid even to go out. </sentence><sentence id="50">So those things were going on daily. </sentence><sentence id="51">It was a daily occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="52">It wasn't new. </sentence><sentence id="53">Q. Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?A. I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="54">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="55">In the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> without help from the outside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially ina small <span class="populated place">town</span> like ours.(c). </sentence><sentence id="56">Did you observe <span class="spatial object">shobot</span>, holidays, anything?A. We used to observe it in the way we could. </sentence><sentence id="57">I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war. </sentence><sentence id="58">If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive. </sentence><sentence id="59">I used to help a little bit because I worked in the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it <span class="building">home</span> instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit.(c). </sentence><sentence id="60">Tell me a little about the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span>, how you got that job?A. The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Sam Spiegal 8 May 3, 1995 Judenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="61">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the <span class="building">Judenaut</span> and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. </sentence><sentence id="62">I brought it <span class="building">home</span>, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from.(c). </sentence><sentence id="63">What other privileges did you get from working there?A. The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="building">home</span>, and I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, if I had to go out for something. </sentence><sentence id="64">If you get out from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more. </sentence><sentence id="65">Q.

We knew it was a very difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="73">You have to understand what was going on in those days. </sentence><sentence id="74">You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do. </sentence><sentence id="75">If they came in and saw the President of the <span class="building">Judenaut</span>, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to supply those 200 people. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take me? </sentence><sentence id="77">Why not take somebody else? </sentence><sentence id="78">You're put in the position that if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right. </sentence><sentence id="79">I'm sure that you heard that , which was the President,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Sam Spiegal 10 May 3, 1995 lose their life. </sentence><sentence id="80">Os Now, you worked in the labor department?A. Right. </sentence><sentence id="81">The <span class="building">labor department</span>, for instance, the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="82">They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to <span class="building">work</span> tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the <span class="spatial object">register</span> that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day. </sentence><sentence id="83">I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work. </sentence><sentence id="84">I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">Os But how were those choices made, which 200?A. They usually were made according the list that we had. </sentence><sentence id="86">The way the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top of them. </sentence><sentence id="87">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="88">I was 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="89">I didn't make the big decisions. </sentence><sentence id="90">They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of town.(c). </sentence><sentence id="91">Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?A. Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="92">I  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Sam Spiegal 11 May 3, 1995 mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. </sentence><sentence id="93">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="94">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier. </sentence><sentence id="95">I imagine everybody did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="96">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them. </sentence><sentence id="97">If I could help somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="98">Q. Were there women in the Judenaut?A. No, not too many that I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="99">Q.

That's right. </sentence><sentence id="102">They used to dispense the food. </sentence><sentence id="103">They used to get it, and then divide it. </sentence><sentence id="104">The people used to have little <span class="spatial object">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="105">We also had <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves.(c). </sentence><sentence id="106">Anything else about the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> that you can think of?A.

them or did the Jews kind of stick with themselves?A. A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very comfortable with them because they were in charge with our <span class="populated place">camps</span>, of our <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> and they all had to leave in order for us to get over there. </sentence><sentence id="407">We couldn't stay with them together. </sentence><sentence id="408">Because people don't realize but they were our enemies not our friends. </sentence><sentence id="409">They used to say they were in <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but we know what kind of <span class="populated place">camps</span> they went into. </sentence><sentence id="410">Q.

To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of people that were very religious and they had religion going on. </sentence><sentence id="418">They didn't have those big <span class="building">temples</span> like they have here, but they had little <span class="interior space">rooms</span> that they got together, but they celebrated either Passover or Rosh Hoshana, Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="419">We celebrated those holidays. </sentence><sentence id="420">There were some that didn't want to celebrate and you had some that were very religious and some were not so religious. </sentence><sentence id="421">Q.

things during the day, and I told I have to be busy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing all those monstrosities and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="460">I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can see them and I feel them. </sentence><sentence id="461">I wake up in a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to

further information about this collection <span class="building">Sam Spiegal 44</span> May 3, 1995 to me. </sentence><sentence id="466">But later on they never asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all the time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. </sentence><sentence id="467">Even now, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. </sentence><sentence id="468">We knew what you went through but we didn't want to ask you about it. </sentence><sentence id="469">Even now, after 50 years, it's very,
