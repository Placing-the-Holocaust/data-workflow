So in that sense...uh...was my father involved? </sentence><sentence id="90">I suppose so. </sentence><sentence id="91">I... don't know. </sentence><sentence id="92">I was 13 when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="93">I know he used to belong to a...to a little schul. </sentence><sentence id="94">I know he used to go. </sentence><sentence id="95">Iam calling it a schul because it was not a <span class="building">temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was a little <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">My mother only went to <span class="building">synagogue</span> during high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="98">But my father used to go every Friday. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I do remember. </sentence><sentence id="100">This is what I...I..., | loved my father very much. </sentence><sentence id="101">I...1 know he was a very good person. </sentence><sentence id="102">I remember that even though he was an observant Jew, he used to take money with him on Friday evening and put it.... Somebody told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="103">I didn't... maybe my mom, later on....He used to look at the <span class="spatial object">hangers</span>, at the coats hanging; and if he found a coat that looked very ragged, somebody passing through the <span class="populated place">city</span>, somebody poor, he used to put the money into this pocket. </sentence><sentence id="104">This was giving in secret, kind of. </sentence><sentence id="105">My father didn't know who he gave it to, and the man didn't know who he got it from. </sentence><sentence id="106">And my father also used to bring often what you call an ["oreach" (ph)], a guest for Friday evening, to dinner, somebody poor. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh...That's the extent that I know that my father was involved. </sentence><sentence id="108">How he was...whether he was involved in the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> or I don't really know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about your daily life with your, as a child, with your siblings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, I was...uh...as I say, | was 13 when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="143">The last year of my life I went to <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, which is a <span class="building">high school</span>, name for a <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">I had finished six grade. </sentence><sentence id="145">I went to <span class="building">public school</span> until I was 12, and that last year I commuted. </sentence><sentence id="146">I went to <span class="populated place">B_dzin</span> which is a <span class="populated place">city</span> next to ours to a...a... <span class="building">Jewish Polish gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">I say Jewish because... uh ...the curriculum in the <span class="building">school</span> was dictated by the Department of Education in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">I am sure was a accredited, very fine <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">Uh...But the student population was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="150">Not all the teachers were Jewish, not all the professors as we called them. </sentence><sentence id="151">And, of course, the important thing is that one of the languages taught in this <span class="building">school</span> was Hebrew as a language. </sentence><sentence id="152">And then history, Jewish history, and bible. </sentence><sentence id="153">Uh... This was my first exposure to Hebrew, as a language. </sentence><sentence id="154">I had one year of Hebrew before the war. </sentence><sentence id="155">The reason I went to <span class="populated place">B_dzin</span> is because...we had a <span class="building">gymnasium</span> in <span class="populated place">Sosnowiec</span>, the same type of a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>; but my father came from <span class="populated place">B_dzin</span> and my father thought that the <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">B_dzin</span> was better. </sentence><sentence id="156">And I think he was right. </sentence><sentence id="157">It was a...a better <span class="building">school</span>, and he wanted me to go to a good <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I was not  happy about it. </sentence><sentence id="159">Many of my friends were going to a <span class="building">school</span> in my <span class="populated place">city</span>, and I didn't like going there. </sentence><sentence id="160">I used to get up in the morning and take a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">The <span class="building">train station</span> was very near my <span class="building">house</span>, because we lived one block away from the <span class="dlf">street</span> on which there was a <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">I used to run for the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, take my <span class="spatial object">train</span>, go to <span class="building">school</span>, come <span class="building">home</span> usually after 2:00. </sentence><sentence id="163">We had dinner. </sentence><sentence id="164">I usually...I remember that dinner was about 2:30 and this is one thing I had to be very prompt for. </sentence><sentence id="165">My father didn't... didn't like anybody being late for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="166">This was for our meal that we spent together as a family everyday. </sentence><sentence id="167">After dinner, my father used to go back to his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Uh... usually did my homework, played with some friends, fought with my siblings. ( </sentence><sentence id="169">Laughter) It was a very normal, usual childhood. </sentence><sentence id="170">I had a very happy <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">I came from a very... was...I was a very happy child...uh..-until the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: You'll have to move your hand over between the <span class="spatial object">mike</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="204">Uh...Can you tell me...uh...what recollections you have of the beginning of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Oh, I have very clear recollections because...uh...the war broke out on September Ist. </sentence><sentence id="209"><span class="building">School</span> was supposed to start on September Ist. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I was supposed to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Remember I told you I didn't like this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">I was very glad that the war broke out because I didn't have to go back to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">This is how stupid I was. </sentence><sentence id="214">I was just...it's amazing when I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="215">At 13, I think I should have been a little more...understanding, but I...I suppose I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="216">It's not fair to say. </sentence><sentence id="217">But there was also that feeling of relief that I don't have to go back to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">And there was also a kind of change in our life. </sentence><sentence id="219">For instance, we had come back from the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">We used to go...every summer we used to go to the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And we came back around August 25th, which is very late. </sentence><sentence id="222">War was in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">I mean we...we were in the <span class="country">country</span>, so we didn't hear that much. </sentence><sentence id="224">But in the <span class="populated place">city</span> things were going on. </sentence><sentence id="225">People were being drafted. </sentence><sentence id="226">Things were really going on. </sentence><sentence id="227">I know when we came back, my mom was trying to buy some food, just make sure that there's some food in the <span class="building">house</span> because she had survived the first World War and she knew that times are going to be rough in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="228">And she couldn't get any...any...any food that really was...any staple food. </sentence><sentence id="229">She couldn't get flour. </sentence><sentence id="230">She couldn't get potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="231">She couldn't get the kind of things that you need, starch, you know, to... and we were not <span class="building">home</span> so there was no...there was no food. </sentence><sentence id="232">But what she was able to...to get were all kinds of delicacies, because these were still available. </sentence><sentence id="233">So there were all kinds of canned foods and lots of chocolates and halva and...and all kinds of fancy cookies...uh...uh...dried fruit. </sentence><sentence id="234">She bought what she could. </sentence><sentence id="235">Well that was..., you know, for a kid that was also a little exciting. </sentence><sentence id="236">Uh...What was really strange is, it didn't take long for us to really get hungry for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was really something. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was... there was no bread. </sentence><sentence id="239">There was no...there was no meat... no...uh...there was no food, really. </sentence><sentence id="240">There was fun food, but you, you know, and, of course, my mom wasn't that...you know, she was holding on to it, too. </sentence><sentence id="241">She didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="242">I remember my brother being very...very unhappy when we finally were able to get some bread when the <span class="dlf">lines</span>, when we stood in <span class="dlf">lines</span> to get the bread after the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="243">How my brother was asking my mother for another slice of bread and my mom said, "No, just one slice of...slice of bread." </sentence><sentence id="244">It was...I remember it was so...it wasn't hunger yet. </sentence><sentence id="245">We weren't hungry. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was just the idea that things were missing. </sentence><sentence id="247">I do remember that the Germans walked into the <span class="populated place">city</span>, marched into the <span class="populated place">city</span>, on September 3rd, because you see we were so close to the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I remember (cough) that we were in the  <span class="building">house</span>, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="249">Everybody was...nobody was going out onto the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">People were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="251">We heard the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> rolling into the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was tremendous noise, shouting. </sentence><sentence id="253">There were some shots. </sentence><sentence id="254">People may have been caught in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">I didn't see any of it, but I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="256">| was afraid to go to the <span class="dlf">window</span> even though some of our <span class="dlf">windows</span> were going out into the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">And...uh...(Coughing) (drinking water) and I, as I said, I... just remember that we were in the <span class="building">house</span> in the beginning because apparently it was either we were not allowed to go into the <span class="dlf">street</span> or we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="258">And then I suppose we started going out into the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">I do remember two things. </sentence><sentence id="260">I remember apparently being told by my parents to go out early in the morning and try to get some bread in a <span class="building">bakery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">And I don't know...I don't remember whether I went with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="262">I think I may have gone with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="263">I know my mother didn't want my father out of the <span class="building">house</span>, and we went and I remember we stood in <span class="dlf">line</span> for a long time, and we did get a bread and came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">That was the first memory of...of something that was scary because it was dark outside and the <span class="dlf">lines</span> were long and the Germans were standing in a kind of making sure that nobody was getting into the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And...uh...everybody was allowed to buy one bread. ( </sentence><sentence id="266">Cough) About 10 days or 2 weeks after we were...after the Germans came into the <span class="populated place">city</span>...uh...they came into our <span class="building">house</span>...into our <span class="building">apartment house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">By the way, in our <span class="building">apartment house</span>...uh...I don't know how many tenants lived there, but not all of them were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="268">They came into the <span class="dlf">court yard</span> and they started to shout, "Alle Juden, Raus!", </sentence><sentence id="269">which means "All Jews Out!" </sentence><sentence id="270">They were telling us to come down to the <span class="interior space">court yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I remember my father and my mother, the four of us went down <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">I think our cook was still with us. </sentence><sentence id="273">She was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="274">She may have come down. </sentence><sentence id="275">She left shortly after that. </sentence><sentence id="276">She went back to her <span class="populated place">town</span>...to her <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">And they took my father. </sentence><sentence id="278">They took all the men, and we went back to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">And I don't...I don't remember how long my father was gone. </sentence><sentence id="280">I am sure it wasn't very long. </sentence><sentence id="281">Maybe a week. </sentence><sentence id="282">What I do remember is that my father had auburn hair. </sentence><sentence id="283">You have auburn hair, don't you? </sentence><sentence id="284">My father had auburn hair. </sentence><sentence id="285">When he came back, he was practically grey. </sentence><sentence id="286">I...1 do remember that. </sentence><sentence id="287">He was born in 1900, so he was 39 years old. </sentence><sentence id="288">He was grey. </sentence><sentence id="289">And...uh...I also remember that not all men came back, because we heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="290">Apparently, they...they killed some, just at random. </sentence><sentence id="291">But it was also at that time that they chose, that they asked the people who...who was a member of a committee of the Jewish...uh...Jewish Community. </sentence><sentence id="292">If...if..every <span class="populated place">city</span> had a Rabbi, had a <span class="building">Jewish Community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">And I do remember that...uh...no, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="294">I...I was told that the man who was chosen to be the head of our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was a man by the name of [Moinvek Meren (ph)]. [ </sentence><sentence id="295"><span class="populated place">Moinyek</span> (ph)] is a probably somewhat Polish name for Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="296">His name was Meren. </sentence><sentence id="297">He was a...he was probably also in his late 30s, maybe my father's age, and he had...he had worked for us at one time before the war as a...uh... don't want to call it traveling salesman. </sentence><sentence id="298">He was a salesman, and he was...he had a certain <span class="region">area</span> where he would...uh...go in and had customers he sold, you know, the products of my father's. </sentence><sentence id="299">You know, my father produced that was, you know, made in our <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">And he became the head of the committee of the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>, and probably other people. </sentence><sentence id="301">Uh...My father, as I said, came <span class="building">home</span>; and shortly after that something else happened. </sentence><sentence id="302">Two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="303">First our <span class="building">factory</span> was taken over by what the Germans called a "<span class="building">Treuhandler</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="304">Treuhandler" means somebody that the Germans could trust. </sentence><sentence id="305">It was a German who took over the <span class="building">factory</span>, but my father was working there. </sentence><sentence id="306">He was in effect probably teaching the Treuhandler and, you know, how to run the <span class="building">factory</span>. [ </sentence><sentence id="307">NB: German "Treuhandler" = trustee or custodian] And  he...uh....because of that, he was allowed some...he was probably getting some money for his work, and he was given ration cards, and so was his family. </sentence><sentence id="308">Everybody had to work. </sentence><sentence id="309">The fact that my father worked was very important because then we were allowed to get...uh...cards so that we could...we were able to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="310">It was all rationed, but we had the coupons to buy whatever was allowed for us to buy. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now let me tell you a little bit about our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because it was a little different then for instance, the <span class="populated place">Lodz ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">Until the end of 1942, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Sosnowiec</span> was what you called an open <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, which means that we were not...we were not walled in. </sentence><sentence id="313">And many of us stayed in our <span class="interior space">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">For instance, we stayed in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in 1940...at the end of 1942, except that they had...we didn't have the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> all to ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="315">We had to share it with other refugees, with other Jews who were.... We've had for instance a family living with us that came in from <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="316">They were German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="317">Uh...Some Jews had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="318">It depended on...some <span class="dlf">streets</span> became what you called "<span class="building">Judenrein</span>," "Free of Jews." </sentence><sentence id="319">Those... uh ...the people who lived on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> that became <span class="building">Judenrein</span>, that the Jews were not allowed, they had to be moved into the <span class="dlf">streets</span> where the Jews were allowed. </sentence><sentence id="320">My <span class="dlf">street</span> was still one of the <span class="dlf">streets</span> that was part of the open <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">And we lived in that <span class="dlf">street</span>, on that <span class="dlf">street</span>, as I say, until the end of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="322">And interestingly enough in our <span class="building">apartment house</span>, there were still the Polish tenants were still living there. </sentence><sentence id="323">So while we were not allowed into some <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and some of...and the Poles were allowed into some <span class="dlf">streets</span>, the Poles could come into the places where the Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="324">Because of that and, as I said, because it was that kind of an open <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there was a possibility for some barter, for some dealings with the Poles; and maybe even with some Germans, although I don't know, or "Volksdeutsch," half-German. </sentence><sentence id="325">And because of that situation in our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in terms of hunger, until about 42 was not that bad. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was...it depended...I shouldn't say that...it depended really on what your situation was because the rationing...uh...the food that you were allowed, legally, was really not much. </sentence><sentence id="327">But if you had some other means, you could if you had some hidden jewelry, you could get something on the <span class="building">black market</span> if you will. </sentence><sentence id="328">So you could supplement your rationing. </sentence><sentence id="329">And in that sense some people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> fared better than others. </sentence><sentence id="330">People who were poor to start with, did worse. </sentence><sentence id="331">People who had something, did better. </sentence><sentence id="332">Now that doesn't mean that people were able to keep everything they had. </sentence><sentence id="333">This brings me to the other story....uh...because also shortly, that was all in the fall of 1939, there was a knock on our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">And there was a German woman and two SS men were with her and she...they came into our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and she walked through the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and she turned to the SS men and she said, "Ich habe gernes. </sentence><sentence id="335">Alles." -- " </sentence><sentence id="336">I like it. </sentence><sentence id="337">All of it." </sentence><sentence id="338">And they send in some people a day later...uh...probably they brought in a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they unloaded, they took everything out of...out of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">I'm talking about our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">All our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, <span class="spatial object">rugs</span>, whatever...whatever she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="341">She was a nice...nice lady. </sentence><sentence id="342">She sent us an old <span class="spatial object">table</span>, some <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>, some old <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">Uh...<span class="spatial object">wardrobe</span>, probably what she had. </sentence><sentence id="344">She must not have been a very well-to-do woman, but you see she became rich because she was German. </sentence><sentence id="345">So we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> left then and, of course, the German I am sure you know that...that there were from the beginning, they were collecting everything. </sentence><sentence id="346">First you had to give...give away all your gold. </sentence><sentence id="347">Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents, I am sure, had to give away, but I am also sure that my mom, or my parents may have hidden some things, because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food  in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">Uh...Then it got much worse, and about a year...1939...19...in 1940, things were semi-normal. </sentence><sentence id="349">I shouldn't call it normal, but life just went on. </sentence><sentence id="350">My father was working. </sentence><sentence id="351">Then my mother had to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="352">But I and my sister and even my younger sister were privately tutored. </sentence><sentence id="353">That was not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="354"><span class="building">Schools</span>, of course, were closed. </sentence><sentence id="355">There wasn't....there were no <span class="building">schools</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="356">But my parents...my parents, you see, were hoping that the war is going to end. </sentence><sentence id="357">They didn't...they didn't envisage anything like that, and they felt that we needed to continue with our education so...uh...as little as they had, they paid. </sentence><sentence id="358">We had...there were some teachers, professors who used to teach in <span class="building">schools</span> and...uh...when I say I was privately tutored, I don't mean that I was tutored on a one-to-one basis, but what we had is we would go to our...to a teacher's <span class="building">home</span> during the day and there were, let's say, 12 of us, and we would learn. </sentence><sentence id="359">We would study Polish literature, history, geography...uh...some sciences, but that was difficult because we had no <span class="building">lab</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">Mathematics. </sentence><sentence id="361">I remember working very hard. </sentence><sentence id="362">This was, see, now I was very serious. </sentence><sentence id="363">This was important. </sentence><sentence id="364">I...I...I think I was in <span class="building">school</span> til the beginning...(sigh) "til the beginning of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="365">When I say in <span class="building">school</span> I was...I was getting...taking lessons, even though somewhere around "41, I think in the summer of 1941, I started working somewhere in a...in one of those <span class="populated place">ghetto resorts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">In other words, <span class="building">ghetto factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">But probably not full-time because I still had some time for lessons, and then I no longer could do it. </sentence><sentence id="368">I had to work full-time and I had to give up, but I know that I studied a lot, and I even took some...a lot of Hebrew during the war. </sentence><sentence id="369">Because it was important. </sentence><sentence id="370">I also tutored my younger, my kid brother who was only six when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="371">I taught him how to read and write. </sentence><sentence id="372">I taught him a lot of mathematics, and he was a whiz anyway. </sentence><sentence id="373">He was very good in mathematics. </sentence><sentence id="374">So I...uh...so in that sense there were some, there was a certain amount of normalcy in our life because my parents, as I say, believed in the beginning that things are going to be okay. </sentence><sentence id="375">And...uh...I don't think they realized what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="376">In the beginning, my father, I remember, used to listen to a <span class="spatial object">BBC radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">One of the neighbors had a hidden radio, and he would come back and tell us that <span class="country">France</span> fell; and then I think that it was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="378">Of course, we also had a curfew and we were not allowed into the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, I think after 7 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="379">And that, by the way, was good in one way for me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="380">I read constantly. </sentence><sentence id="381">There were still <span class="building">libraries</span> that you can borrow books from. </sentence><sentence id="382"><span class="building">Private libraries</span>, and I used to read. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think that I...I got a...1 got my really basic education during this because I was reading constantly. </sentence><sentence id="384">I...I suppose my parents encouraged it, but I really was always a bit of a bookworm and I... So this was, as I said, things started and...and nobody...nobody realized what...what was going to happen because, again, I am painting a...am giving you a kind of picture of...now, of course, with it...uh... things started to happen in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">People started to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="386">Mostly, at that point, young people were taken to...uh...<span class="populated place">work camps</span>, <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and...uh... and people would just disappear. </sentence><sentence id="387">They would be walking in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and they would be taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="388">People were also taken constantly to work in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">I remember coming back from somewhere and being...I was still young, so it didn't happen to me often, but it happened to my father a lot that they would take people who had to shovel show, clear the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">They were always looking for something. </sentence><sentence id="391">You know, in addition to the fact that people had to work, they were always catching people, if you will, for some additional work, but in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, as I say there was a militia and we were again, ...how shall I say? </sentence><sentence id="392">The governing of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was done by the....by the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="393">Now when my.... Okay. </sentence><sentence id="394">In 1942...Let me...I can't...I...you don't  want to take that long so... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="586">In...two things happened in 19...things started... things started to turn towards the end of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="587">The winter of 1941 was really a hard winter. </sentence><sentence id="588">The winter before was hard, too; but this winter started it was a very cold winter. </sentence><sentence id="589">It was difficult to get heating. </sentence><sentence id="590">Food was getting scarce. </sentence><sentence id="591">Things were getting rough. </sentence><sentence id="592">By...by the end of 1941, many people had been taken out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but again if they were taken to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="593">Most of them were young men and women taken to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="594">And in 1942, sometimes around March, they came and took some...the militia people, not even Germans, came to our <span class="building">house</span> and, with a list, and I was on that list, and they took me...uh...out of the <span class="building">house</span> to take me to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="595">Now in order to get to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>...uh...they didn't...we were not taken directly. </sentence><sentence id="596">We were taken to what was once a...the <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> in <span class="populated place">Sosnowiec</span>, which now served as a "<span class="building">Durchgangslager</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="597"><span class="dlf">Durchgangslager</span>" means a transition [<span class="populated place">transit] camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">We were put in there until, I suppose, the <span class="building">factory</span> owners or people from <span class="country">Germany</span> would come and select people for different ... uh ... activities or different work. </sentence><sentence id="599">And there was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for women, a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> for women, and for men, and that night they must have taken a lot of men and a lot of women. </sentence><sentence id="600">And...young, young.... I was not quite sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="601">I was..., this was the beginning of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was born in 1926, so I was 15 and a half, and my...uh...my parents were apparently devastated. </sentence><sentence id="603">They shouldn't have been. </sentence><sentence id="604">If they had known about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they should have been glad that I'm not being...that I'm going to <span class="country">Germany</span>, to work, but they didn't know about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they wanted to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="605">I was my father's favorite daughter. </sentence><sentence id="606">I don't think people should have favorites, but I think my...I was my...I was a favorite of my father. </sentence><sentence id="607">And he was...he was heartbroken. </sentence><sentence id="608">And he wanted to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="609">And at that time, there were still people who were able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="610">Now the way you did it is you paid money to a family that was poorer than you were, if you could afford it; and somebody--but this was a voluntary arrangement--and that somebody would go for you. </sentence><sentence id="611">And my father apparently found a family where they were terribly poor. </sentence><sentence id="612">There was...in other words, if we were hungry, they were hungrier, and my father apparently gave them whatever, promised to give them whatever he...I don't know, maybe he had a ring left... whatever he had...and their daughter...and I think my father.... That was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="613">Their daughter was about 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="614">She was a little older. </sentence><sentence id="615">I think what bothered my father..., I think he was very troubled, was that I was really basically still a kid. </sentence><sentence id="616">I was only 15 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="617">Now I wasn't the only one at 15 and a half taken; but for my father, this was...so they made arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="618">And she was supposed to come in in the morning to this <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, and say that she is my substitute, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="619">Now I didn't know anything about it except, because we were...there were...nobody was allowed to come and see us, except that I would come to the <span class="dlf">window</span> and my father would pass by and he kind of motioned to me that...that they're trying to get me out. </sentence><sentence id="620">And that morning my name was called, and L...and I was told to take my...whatever stuff I had because when they took me to this <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>, they permitted my parents to bring some clothing for me. </sentence><sentence id="621">So I had some clothing with me. </sentence><sentence id="622">I took my bundle, whatever I had and I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="623">I was walking out. </sentence><sentence id="624">And as I was walking out, I noticed that my sister--who was born 2 and 1/2 ...who was 13--was walking in. </sentence><sentence id="625">And I...I was... was...I was...first of all, I had  been in that <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> for...for a good week. </sentence><sentence id="626">I was tired and hungry and dirty and sleepy and...because it was not a very pleasant place. </sentence><sentence id="627">So I was very...I was...I was not quite there; but I did see my sister, and when I ran out and I...my father wasn't...people ...people are not allowed near, but when I crossed the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I saw my father and my mother, I started to cry and I said, "What happened? </sentence><sentence id="628">Why is Pnina...why is my sister...why did she go in there?What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="629">And they started to cry, and they told me that that morning when this woman who is supposed to go for me was supposed to come in and they were supposed to take her, she had changed her mind and they were desperate. </sentence><sentence id="630">They...they had made all the arrangements, but they didn't have the substitute; whereupon my younger sister, who was a real tomboy, always was, said, "I am going to go for Bella." </sentence><sentence id="631">And my father...my parents thought she's crazy. </sentence><sentence id="632">First, of all what kind of an exchange was that? </sentence><sentence id="633">I mean...and she said, "Don't you understand? </sentence><sentence id="634">I am 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="635">They are not going to keep me. </sentence><sentence id="636">They are going to send me right back." </sentence><sentence id="637">She was going to fool them. </sentence><sentence id="638">I don't know how my parents could ... I think that they were...I don't think that...I don't think that they were thinking clearly because it was...it was a crazy plan. </sentence><sentence id="639">But they allowed her to do it. </sentence><sentence id="640">And she was also very, my sister's a very strong person. </sentence><sentence id="641">She must have been very persuasive, and my parents were very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="642">They must have been in a very bad state, and she was very upbeat about it. </sentence><sentence id="643">I suppose, I...I wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="644">But I know that my sister went in there, and my parents expected her to be sent out a day later and she was sent to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Sudetenland</span>, which is in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="645">And...uh... I don't have to tell you how we all felt, ...how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="646">She went for me. </sentence><sentence id="647">And...uh...at that time, she was allowed to write. </sentence><sentence id="648">Once a month we would get a postcard from her, and she wrote cheerful notes; that she's okay, that she's the youngest in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, everybody's taking care of her. </sentence><sentence id="649">And lo and behold, three months after she was taken to this <span class="region">Sudetenland</span> we got...we received a letter from the <span class="populated place">Jewish Community</span> that she is coming <span class="building">home</span>, and two days later...really three months after she had left...she went...she left <span class="building">home</span>, she came in from German ... from <span class="populated place">Sudetenland</span> to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> with her belongings. </sentence><sentence id="650">One of those unusual things, but this is very German. </sentence><sentence id="651">Apparently...now then she told us what happened. </sentence><sentence id="652">When she got to this <span class="populated place">camp</span> she told the Commandofiihrer, the Lager...the German, that she was taken by mistake, that she's 13 years old, that she's a child, that she's not...and she wants to go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="653">And...uh...it took three months, but they arranged to send her back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="654">Now one of the...as I say, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was operating. </sentence><sentence id="655">They could have very...they could have sent her...they should have sent her to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="656">Anybody getting sick in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, anybody claiming not being able to work was always sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="657">I don't know why they didn't send her to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">I think it's...it was this German bureaucracy. </sentence><sentence id="659">Once she convinced the Commandofiihrer there that she didn't belong here and that there was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and her parents were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, she was sent back to her parents. </sentence><sentence id="660">And...uh...she became somewhat of a celebrity, I think, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because first of all, the fact that she managed...first of all that she went for me. </sentence><sentence id="661">Secondly, that she managed to come back. </sentence><sentence id="662">Very few people... no, I don't remember anybody coming back from a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="663">Maybe there was some case, but she did. </sentence><sentence id="664">And...uh...she was such a celebrity that...(sigh)... celebrity...that in this same year--1942, August, a very memorable time for...for me, for us--we were...orders were posted all...all over the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that all the Jewish inhabitants of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> have to come to the <span class="building">stadium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">We had a <span class="building">sports stadium</span> on the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="666">And we were all told to dress nicely and to  come to this <span class="building">stadium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">I remember there was a discussion in the <span class="building">house</span> whether we should go...uh...the warnings were that anybody that the...the German soldiers are going to go through <span class="building">apartment houses</span>...anybody hid...find...found hiding will be shot immediately, and I need to tell you that we had witnessed atrocities in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">It isn't that the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is without any incidences. </sentence><sentence id="669">If they caught somebody doing something that the Germans didn't think was legal, they would hang them in <span class="building">public</span> and people would have to come and watch. </sentence><sentence id="670">In fact, our neighbor...we had a neighbor who owned a little <span class="building">store</span>, and he was caught for something and he and his two sons were hung [hanged] and I remember that we were all forced to go and watch it. </sentence><sentence id="671">So the warning to come...that was...I don't know whether there are people who didn't come to the <span class="building">stadium</span>, but I know that the six of us went to the <span class="building">stadium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">And...uh...it was a very warm day. </sentence><sentence id="673">It was August. </sentence><sentence id="674"><span class="country">Poland</span> is not...doesn't have a very hot climate, but it was one of those real hot days; and we were standing for hours. </sentence><sentence id="675">We were supposed to be there at 8 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="676">In fact...in fact, 1 remember something else which was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="677">We were walking...they were walking us, not on the <span class="dlf">sidewalks</span>, but in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and the Poles...Polish people, non-Jews, were standing on both sides of the <span

and...uh...suddenly I...L..I probably wasn't the only one, I noticed that we were not alone. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Somebody's watching us. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And I turned my head very kind of slightly. </sentence><sentence id="1149">I was afraid to move. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And I noticed that one of the SS men was standing near us, and he was looking at her singing. </sentence><sentence id="1151">She was singing. </sentence><sentence id="1152">She didn't notice him. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And he was really looking at her with rapt...what you call you rapture or something. </sentence><sentence id="1154">He really was enchanted. </sentence><sentence id="1155">It was obvious. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I remember I was very scared. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And suddenly she must have noticed that he was looking at her, and she stopped singing. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And he walked towards her and kinda of pushed us to the aside and he...she was sitting. </sentence><sentence id="1159">He pulled her up and he started to beat on her. </sentence><sentence id="1160">He hit on her face. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Right, left. </sentence><sentence id="1162">He was beating on her. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And he was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1164">He was screaming so loudly. </sentence><sentence id="1165">He probably was maybe her age, maybe a couple of years older. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And he was  4 screaming, "You have no right to sing to like this. </sentence><sentence id="1167">You have no right to look like this. </sentence><sentence id="1168">You filthy Jew." ( </sentence><sentence id="1169">long pause) I remember something else that happened in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And that was...I don't know how much time I have and I...I want to tell you about <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> because I think it's important. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1336">She was in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, and by the time she made it to <span class="populated place">Graben</span>, she was at least for that time a different person. </sentence><sentence id="1337">Frieda was my <span class="populated place">camp</span> sister. </sentence><sentence id="1338">She was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="1339">She and I

strength and I would like to tell you about it, but this time...but when it came to Frieda, I never cheated on her. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I don't think she ever cheated on me. </sentence><sentence id="1348">In 1944, in the fall of 1944, we were evacuated from <span class="populated place">Graben</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1349">We heard rumors that the Russians are moving in, that they have occupied part of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1350">But these were rumors and we were sent on what you call the famous "Death March." </sentence><sentence id="1351">It was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1352">It was November I think. </sentence><sentence id="1353">It was cold, and we were marched for days. </sentence><sentence id="1354">I don't remember how long. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Then we were put into <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span> and...uh...I don't remember how long we were on the <span

chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1361">They didn't need any <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1362">It was a really <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1363">I remember we were brought into a big empty <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1364">There was only straw on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1365">We were pushed into that <span class="building">barrack</span> so that you could not stretch your legs. </sentence><sentence id="1366">We were sitting with our knees practically up to our...you know, next to our chins. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And...uh...and you couldn't stretch your legs and it was cold and we were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Uh...I want to tell you that it didn't take long and we could stretch our legs, because people were...people were dying. </sentence><sentence id="1369">Almost immediately people were dying all around us. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And...uh...we had to take out the dead people  6 and we had to carry them out on a...outside there were always big piles of dead bodies and I... carried many. </sentence><sentence id="1371">I don't know how I kept going. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I tell you I...people have some way of protecting themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1373">I know that I never...never looked at the faces, just didn't look at the faces. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Uh...One day somebody came looking for Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="1375">This was a Jewish woman, she was in her early 20s. </sentence><sentence id="1376">She had survived <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1377">She came to <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and she was in the...call it <span class="building">establishment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1378">She was not on a <span class="building">barrack</span> sitting on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1379">She probably had a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>; and she was working, maybe in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And she started calling around, "Is there a Frieda [Wringer (ph)] here? </sentence><sentence id="1382">Frieda [<span class="building">Wrinder</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And...I'm sorry...she didn't call Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="1384">She called "<span class="building">Tila</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1385">Tila was Frieda's older sister, and she was looking for Tila. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And when Frieda heard her name, she stepped out and she said, "I am not Tila," but I am her sister. </sentence><sentence id="1387">What do you know about <span class="populated place">Tila</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="1388">Because Tila was her oldest sister and she was taken out of their <span class="building">house</span> early in the war cause she volunteered...she was going to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, they thought, to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and she was one of the very early inmates in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1389">This is what Frieda found out from this girl. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And this Tila was apparently one of those unusual women that whenever she could save somebody in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> she did, and she saved this girl's life. </sentence><sentence id="1391">She literally pulled her out...out of the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1392">And this woman was looking for Tila because she wanted to repay a debt. </sentence><sentence id="1393">She wanted to...to find her. </sentence><sentence id="1394">When she saw Frieda, she said ...immediately, she believed her because apparently... I...I know, I met Tila after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1395">They looked exactly the same except that Tila was dark haired and the other one was blond, but Tila had the same eyes, the same face; and she said, "Yah, I believe you that you are her sister. </sentence><sentence id="1396">You look like her. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I am going to take you out of her because you will die here." </sentence><sentence id="1398">And Frieda said, "Then you have to take Bella." </sentence><sentence id="1399">And this woman looked at me and at Frieda and she said, "I'm not taking Bella. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I'm taking you. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I don't owe anything to <span class="populated place">Bella</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1402">If you want to come with me, you come right now." </sentence><sentence id="1403">And Frieda was hesitating cause she wasn't going to go without me, and I said to Frieda, "Frieda, for God's sake, go. </sentence><sentence id="1404">First of all if you can save yourself, why not? </sentence><sentence id="1405">And secondly, maybe you can help me if you get out. </sentence><sentence id="1406">You certainly won't be able to help me if you're here." </sentence><sentence id="1407">So she got out and she became a...a runner for a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Uh...And I think that because of it, she had a little easier time of it. </sentence><sentence id="1409">She had a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1410">She wasn't in this horrible place and she had a little more food, because food in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> was given very sporadically. </sentence><sentence id="1411">You never knew when you were going to get a piece of bread or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And again when she could, she would come in and bring me a potato or whatever she could. </sentence><sentence id="1413">I would get up every morning, I was covered with lice. </sentence><sentence id="1414">I wore one of those...uh...<span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1415">You know, they were grey and blue. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Well, in the morning you couldn't see the blue. </sentence><sentence id="1417">It was all grey. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I was totally covered with lice. </sentence><sentence id="1419">As long as I could I used to shake. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I used to take this thing off and I used to shake it out. </sentence><sentence id="1421">If I could get some cold water, I would wash. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Later on, I am sure I didn't wash. </sentence><sentence id="1423">I would shake out all the lice. </sentence><sentence id="1424">I would put that thing on, and half an hour later, I was covered with lice. </sentence><sentence id="1425">I had typhus; then I had typhoid, which is different. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Typhus is a stomach illness. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Typhoid is a fever, headaches. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I don't know how I made it. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And at the end of the war, I had paratyphoid. </sentence><sentence id="1430">But before that...before I had this paratyphoid, after I pulled through this both typhus and typhoid, ...uh...Frieda managed to find, for me, a job. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And she got me out of that <span class="building">barrack</span>, which was the worse, into a <span class="building">barrack</span> where I could have a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> which I shared with another girl. </sentence><sentence id="1432">So this was not great luxury, but it was a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> and I was permitted to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="1433">What was my work consisting of?
