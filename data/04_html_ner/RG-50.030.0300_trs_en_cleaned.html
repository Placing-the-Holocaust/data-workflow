<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Why don't you tell me your full name and your name when you were born, and when and where you were born and then a little about your childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Lisa Nussbaum Derman. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Raczki</span> <span class="country">Poland</span> in 1926. </sentence><sentence id="5">I was one of three children. </sentence><sentence id="6">I had an older sister Pola and a baby brother Busiek. </sentence><sentence id="7">My parents Herschel and Gittel Nussbaum and an Aunt Sarah that lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="8">I lived in a very small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">We were approximately five kilometers from the <span class="dlf">German border</span> in <span class="region">East Russia</span>, <span class="populated place">Ostpreussen</span>!. </sentence><sentence id="10">And this is where I grew up until the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="11">It was a <span class="populated place">town</span> with not that many Jewish families, 50 Jewish families, surrounded maybe by a 1,000 or 1,500 Christians. </sentence><sentence id="12">I grew up in a loving <span class="building">home</span>, a beautiful <span class="building">Jewish home</span> that instilled in all three of us children wonderful values that really kept me through the years and through this entire traumatic experience. </sentence><sentence id="13">I went to <span class="building">public school</span> as a child, and then I also went to a <span class="building">Hebrew school</span>, and when there were not enough Jewish children for a <span class="building">school</span>, my parents had a private tutor in the <span class="building">house</span>, a Hebrew tutor for myself and my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="14">My father was an exporter. </sentence><sentence id="15">He exported geese and lumber to <span class="country">Germany</span> and he was sort of involved within the <span class="region">German world</span>, so to say. </sentence><sentence id="16">When Hitler came to power, my father's business at <span class="populated place">Raczki</span> came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="17">He was not allowed to trade any more, and conditions had changed. </sentence><sentence id="18">We lived very close to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and we knew really, what went on in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> by this time. </sentence><sentence id="19">However, we were not so much yet affected by it. </sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="populated place">town</span> I grew up in was antisemitic. </sentence><sentence id="21">We suffered from Antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="22">Even though, I have to really tell, that my parents were sort of a very special family in this <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">My mother especially was giving of herself to absolutely everybody, Christians especially. </sentence><sentence id="24">They would come to her to write letters to <span class="country">America</span> because not that many people were educated and literate in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">And by the very same token they suffered from Antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="26">When my father's business came to -- abruptly to an end, my mother too had a business. </sentence><sentence id="27">My mother had a <span class="building">fabric store</span>, a large <span class="building">fabric store</span> and there were sermons in <span class="building">church</span> given very often to say not to buy from Jews, and especially even mentioned my mother's name -- my mother's name was Gittel but in Polish they call it Gitka (ph) -- especially to mention not to buy by <span class="building">Gitka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">Shortly after -- right after Kristallnacht there was already an influx of German Jewish refugees that came to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="29"> None of them came to my <span class="populated place">town</span> because we were too small of a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to accommodate Jews, but however, we heard from them about all the stories. </sentence><sentence id="30">Also, I wanted to be very much aware, even though I lived in this tiny little <span class="populated place">town</span>, there are people in <span class="country">America</span> call there a <span class="populated place">shtetl</span> of the kind people think maybe from the Fiddler on the Roof. </sentence><sentence id="31">No, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="32">It was not because we were quite really advanced in a way. </sentence><sentence id="33">We had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span> in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">We hada <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> in the <span class="building">house</span> and my father in his days when he conducted business traveled very far -- traveled to <span class="country">Germany</span> and to other places, and we really knew what went on in the world but very little, because my parents have done at the time to change what was coming? </sentence><sentence id="35">The war broke out " <span class="region">East Prussia</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="36"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="37">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="38"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="39"> in 1939 and <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided between the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and the <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>, and my <span class="populated place">town</span>, of course, was directly on the <span class="dlf">German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">And immediately the Germans came and occupied the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">I was not in <span class="populated place">town</span> when the Germans came to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="42">My mother sent my little brother and myself to my aunt that was only 15 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="43">I don't really know what was the reasoning and such, and low and behold, when they bombed the <span class="populated place">town</span>, my little brother and I had the measles and we were in a <span class="building">shelter</span> hiding from the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="44">And not even -- we both had such high fever that we didn't even know what went on. </sentence><sentence id="45">The <span class="populated place">town</span> was occupied and simultaneously, the Russians came and the two armies sort of met. </sentence><sentence id="46">And by rectifying <span class="dlf">borders</span> my <span class="populated place">town</span> remained under the Nazi occupation and the rest, 21 kilometers away from my <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Augustow</span> was already the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="47"> My parents had the foresight to leave with the Russians, because the Russians encouraged anyone that wanted to leave with them were able to leave. </sentence><sentence id="48">We left. </sentence><sentence id="49">We took part of our belongings, not everything but part of our belongings and we moved to <span class="populated place">Augustew</span>, which was a <span class="populated place">mining town</span> 21 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="50">On there we were already refugees. </sentence><sentence id="51">We found <span class="building">accommodations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">I started to go to <span class="building">Russian school</span> so that my sister -- my sister already at the time was in <span class="building">gymnasium</span> and much higher grades than I was. </sentence><sentence id="53">My sister was 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="54">And very shortly after -- 1 would not say that I myself as a child suffered much under Russian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="55">My parents provided us with everything that they could. </sentence><sentence id="56">And now we went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">We made new friends, and youth has a way of adjusting very fast. </sentence><sentence id="58">However, my parents had a much harder time, because my father being a businessman had a handicap under their -- the Communist regime. </sentence><sentence id="59">And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">And we moved away from <span class="populated place">Augustow</span> and we moved away to <span class="populated place">Slonim</span>, a <span class="populated place">town</span> which was <span class="country">Poland</span> after 1939, but then in the division of <span class="country">Poland</span> and the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> -- the <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> and <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, ended up under the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="61">We lived on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">town</span>, the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="62">And my aunt that lived with us, Aunt Sarah. </sentence><sentence id="63">We lived on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> on the <span class="env feature">river</span> --on the <span class="env feature">Shchara</span>, and our neighbors were Christians. </sentence><sentence id="64">Predominantly, <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> really was a <span class="populated place">Jewish town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">It was a magnificent <span class="populated place">Jewish town</span> because it had so many learning places, so many <span class="building">synagogues</span>, <span class="building">Yeshivot</span>? -- </sentence><sentence id="66">the famous <span class="building">Yeshiva of Slonim</span>, the rabbis of Slonim, two <span class="building">Jewish high schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">Really, a place that really did not lack of anything one would want to know or really to enjoy in a cultural way as a Jewish child. </sentence><sentence id="68">I had friends, Jewish friends and Christian friends, too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="69">and shortly the war broke out between <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> and the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, and it is there that I really met up with the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="70"> We lived on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">The <span class="populated place">town</span> was not bombed much, and we were not at all affected by the war per se from bombs. </sentence><sentence id="72">Very shortly after the war broke out on the 21st of June, very shortly after, there were announcements that Jews were not allowed to live in certain <span class="interior space">quarters</span>, in certain parts of <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> and we had to move right away. </sentence><sentence id="73">We moved closer in to the <span class="populated place">town</span>, and it is there where really the first of 1,500 men were selected and taken on this <span class="building">market place</span>, and 1,200 men were sent to their deaths, very shortly, as soon as the Nazis occupied the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was done by <span class="building">Einsatzgruppen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">I am sure we did not by that time -- the name. </sentence><sentence id="76">We called ? </sentence><sentence id="77">Plural of <span class="building">Yeshiva</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="79">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="80"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="81"> them the <span class="dlf">chapones</span>? </sentence><sentence id="82">in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="83">Chapen* means to grab someone, because they literally came; they grabbed men, regardless. </sentence><sentence id="84">Whoever looked to them -- they're of a certain age, young sort of -- grabbed them and killed them. </sentence><sentence id="85">My family -- my father and my little brother were not affected. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="86">They were hiding in a <span class="building">outhouse</span> outside in the <span class="building">house</span> where we really lived. </sentence><sentence id="87">But they did not come even to this part of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">Very shortly there was a law, we had to move again. </sentence><sentence id="89">It was still before the real <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was established. </sentence><sentence id="90">We moved again and again, we had to vacate the place because that too was a spot -- it was really the center of <span class="populated place">town</span>, quite prestigious, sort of to say, and we had to move again. </sentence><sentence id="91">And we moved to <span class="populated place">Podgorna</span>, which was the name of the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">And it is there where we moved that already the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was, even though a little bit larger yet than what it ended up at the end. </sentence><sentence id="93">But it was already surrounded by -- loose, loosely what they call -- they prided themselves -- loosely barbed wires. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="94"> And it is there that I witnessed while we lived, still the whole family intact, that I witnessed a massacre. </sentence><sentence id="95">The Germans called it an Aktion&gt;, an action. </sentence><sentence id="96">What it means is really slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I will tell what happened to me on this day. </sentence><sentence id="98">My father did not work as an artisan, as men that had skills. </sentence><sentence id="99">He was a businessman so he only went on slave labor, and he wasn't, quote unquote, "one of these desirable Jews" for a while that did certain, like the shoemakers that sewed their boots or that made their uniforms and such, that for a while yet they need them. </sentence><sentence id="100">On Thursday a sort of strange army came to <span class="populated place">town</span>, and because the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was so loose yet and you could see the <span class="dlf">roads</span> on the outside, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> have been seen and Germans and soldiers -- not only the ones that we knew that are Germans, that are the Einsatzgruppen and the <span class="dlf">chapones</span>, but also auxiliary forces that served the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="101">There came armies in black uniforms with sort of sleeves and with certain insignias on their sleeves that were Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="102">There were Latvians that served Nazis -- not all, but in great number Estonians some. </sentence><sentence id="103">And the panic started in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">What are all these armies invading coming to do in this <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence><sentence id="105">And on the very same day on Thursday, some people returned from work and they received a -- it was called, the German called it a schein(r). </sentence><sentence id="106">It means really, a passport, a tiny little card, an I.D. card that had the person's name and number and the stamp from the Gebietskommissar" which would be the equivalent to the governor. </sentence><sentence id="107">And a panic started. </sentence><sentence id="108">Only very few very, quote unquote, "desirable people" received it. </sentence><sentence id="109">The rest of us didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="110">My family didn't have it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="111"> And my mother, before we went to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, first spoke to our Christian neighbor, that if there is trouble in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> she wants to send her girls to her. </sentence><sentence id="112">Would she take her girls if there was trouble? </sentence><sentence id="113">And the woman said, "Yes, send them to me." </sentence><sentence id="114">When Mother had first visualized that there was danger, she really wanted to save her girls. </sentence><sentence id="115">In a haste we were dressed. </sentence><sentence id="116">She took us to the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> and, you know, it was loosely yet. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were not charged with any high 3 snatchers (Yiddish) 4 to catch (Yiddish) 5 action (German); term used for operations whose objective was the physical removal and destruction of Jews. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">deg certificate (German); term used for Nazi issued work permits. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="119">T regional commissioner (German)

thing of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="124">Mother took us to the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">It was November 13" of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="126">I was not quite 15 years old. </sentence><sentence id="127">My sister and I took off our yellow stars. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="128">Mother lifted the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">We snuck out. </sentence><sentence id="130">There were always guard around the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">All of us already had to wear marking. </sentence><sentence id="132">In <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> the first marking we wore was a round yellow patch, a round patch in the front of the garment and in the back of the garment, and we took it off naturally. </sentence><sentence id="133">Mother lifted the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">She stood inside in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">We stood on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="136">I turned my head back, and that was the last time I saw my mother because my mother was killed on this November 14". </sentence><sentence id="137">My sister and I -- it was already getting dark. </sentence><sentence id="138">I also want to say that other people tried to sneak out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">A lot of people tried to do it and many a times people were shot in the process. </sentence><sentence id="140">I guess you needed some luck too, sometimes not to be shot while you tried to sneak out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141"> It was already quite -- getting dusk, almost dark. </sentence><sentence id="142">We walked very confidently. </sentence><sentence id="143">I knew to keep my head up so nobody would pay attention of two girls walking with their heads down -- try to identifying them -- that maybe they're Jewish and such, because there was a lot of animosity outside. </sentence><sentence id="144">We walked. </sentence><sentence id="145">We came to the <span class="building">woman's house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">Nobody saw us walking in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">In fact, we made it a point not to walk into the <span class="building">house</span> with nobody noticing us. </sentence><sentence id="148">We came. </sentence><sentence id="149">She let us in and she kept us. </sentence><sentence id="150">She told us to go in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> to stay overnight. </sentence><sentence id="151">We did. </sentence><sentence id="152">Friday morning on November 14" there was a knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and a neighbor came to tell her that they are killing all the Jews in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and the woman became frightened and would not keep us as much we begged her. </sentence><sentence id="153">We cried. </sentence><sentence id="154">We just begged her to hide us somewhere -- to tell her that she is no danger -- that no one saw us come into this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">And also, a Jewish man had a much harder time surviving because only Jewish men were circumcised in <span class="country">Europe</span>, Christians were not. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="156">So this was right away identification that this is a Jew -- was a male -- was circumcised. </sentence><sentence id="157">The woman would not keep us as much as we begged her. </sentence><sentence id="158">I have to tell you that it was already cold. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="159">It was winter. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was already some snow on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and she told us to go hide into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, which we were really on the <span class="region">outskirts</span>, not far away -- not really far away. </sentence><sentence id="161">We had no alternative. </sentence><sentence id="162">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="163">What could we have done, two young girls? </sentence><sentence id="164">We went to hide in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="165"> We came into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and we stayed for a while. </sentence><sentence id="166">And all of a sudden there were bullets flying all over -- flying over our heads, and we ran deeper into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> to hide from the bullets. </sentence><sentence id="167">And as we came in deeper to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> we came to the scene of the massacre. </sentence><sentence id="168">It is in this <span class="env feature">forest</span> that on this Friday, 10,000 Jews were killed in open <span class="dlf">pits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">Shot. </sentence><sentence id="170">Of course, we ran from the scene -- the blood, the screams. </sentence><sentence id="171">We ran in opposite direction hoping that we will survive this massacre. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="172">As we were sitting there, both of us frightened, shaking, a ranger came in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">He wanted to know what we were doing in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and we told him that we came to collect some wood for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="174">At first he believed us and he let us stay. </sentence><sentence id="175">He came from the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">He had with him -- he came with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> from the <span class="dlf">road</span> -- he had a rifle slung on his shoulder and an axe behind his belt. </sentence><sentence id="177">We were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> staying and he walked in deeper. </sentence><sentence id="178">He heard all this shooting. </sentence><sentence id="179">He became curious. </sentence><sentence id="180">He walked in deeper and he saw the scene of the massacre. </sentence><sentence id="181">And he came with a rage to us -- that that we are Jewish -- we told him a lie.

in no danger. </sentence><sentence id="190">The viciousness of men. </sentence><sentence id="191">But he didn't take us to the <span class="dlf">pits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">He took us to the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">And as he took us to the <span class="dlf">road</span> -- leading us under the rifle -- and told us to meet up with the group of the Jews that were being led to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="194">The women and children were being walked, walked quietly, holding on to their children -- some carrying them. </sentence><sentence id="195">They were surrounded tightly with guards. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">By running out they would be shot immediately. </sentence><sentence id="197">Men were in <span class="spatial

realized that he is a distance from us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="198"> We ran from the scene to hide in the opposite side of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> away from the shooting

the <span class="dlf">field</span> in all different directions. </sentence><sentence id="225">Of course, the ranger in his rage threw the axe in the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">Then he began to shoot at us. </sentence><sentence id="227">As he threw the axe in the <span class="dlf">field</span> it hit the back of my sister's leg.

did what a human being is to do to the next one that is in kind of trouble that my sister and I were. </sentence><sentence id="253">The woman said, "God, if it should happen to my girls, please somebody, help them, too." </sentence><sentence id="254">And in this <span class="building">house</span> there was a father and two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="255">They were exactly my

</sentence><sentence id="262">Don't fall for it. </sentence><sentence id="263">It is not true." </sentence><sentence id="264">And at no time at all did she tell us to leave, no time at all.

on the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">They let us in. </sentence><sentence id="283">We told them that we are Jewish, that we want to change our clothes with them.

</sentence><sentence id="289">We stayed overnight in the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">Early in the morning before sun, we started out just walking in the <span

what kind of people we would meet up with. </sentence><sentence id="302">So we lived on the berry that we could find, the mushroom that we could find and we finally made our journey to this <span class="building">woman's house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">She took us in. </sentence><sentence id="304">She kept us there for several days. </sentence><sentence id="305">I think two days if I recall, and she kept us hidden; she was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="306">She kept us hidden and she was a very popular woman, a very popular <span class="building">farm house</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span> with children. </sentence><sentence id="307">Evidently, they were wealthy so everybody in the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, all the young people would gather there. </sentence><sentence id="308">So she told the young people when they asked her, "Who are these two girls?" </sentence><sentence id="309">She said, "Oh, I hire two maids to spin and to weave for the winter to make wool." </sentence><sentence id="310">So, she kept us there, and we begged her if the farmers go to <span class="populated place">town</span> to <span class="populated place">Slonim</span>, to see maybe somebody survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">Maybe they didn't kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="312">And she made it in such a way -- she was very clever, very clever -- she made it in such a way that there was no suspicion that she's hiding two Jewish girls or anything. </sentence><sentence id="313">And she told the farmer, "You know, I used to sell eggs and butter to some Jews. </sentence><sentence id="314">I wonder if somebody still survived." </sentence><sentence id="315">The man came back and he told her, "Yes, but they killed 10,000 Jews" -- he heard -- "but there are still Jews." </sentence><sentence id="316">He saw them returning from a nightshift from work. </sentence><sentence id="317">My sister and I immediately left the <span class="building">farm house</span> and we walked back on foot, back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to see if somebody from the family survived. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="318"> We never asked for a ride because we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="319">We would see farmers and such. </sentence><sentence id="320">We wouldn't approach them. </sentence><sentence id="321">We would run into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> to hide. </sentence><sentence id="322">You must also realize it was winter. </sentence><sentence

cold. </sentence><sentence id="325">We made our way back to <span class="populated place">Slonim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">We came back to <span class="populated place">Slonim</span>, and on the <span class="region">outskirts</span> we saw a group of Jews returning from work. </sentence><sentence id="327">We joined them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="328">We sort of ran into their

them to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">We were not counted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335">We just walked in. </sentence><sentence id="336">They kept us in the middle because we didn't have any stars on us and we came into that <span class="interior space">room</span> where the six of us lived, and as I opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> my mother was not there to greet me. </sentence><sentence id="337">Sol knew. </sentence><sentence id="338">My mother was killed. </sentence><sentence id="339">My aunt was killed. </sentence><sentence

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="351"> They shrank the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">They made it smaller and we moved in on the <span

</sentence><sentence id="355">There were two <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, a very rundown place, but -- however it was a little <span class="building">brick house</span> and it was close to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="356">In one <span class="interior space">room</span> the four of us lived, a

sort of thought that maybe, maybe one of us will survive or something. </sentence><sentence id="367">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="368">It wasn't told to us but I somehow had the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="369">And my father went to a slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="370">I did not work in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">I was too young. </sentence><sentence id="372">In fact, my little brother would run out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="373">He was blond and really, his Polish was so very good, and he did many, many times run out on the <span class="region">Christian side</span>, come back, would bring some food. </sentence><sentence id="374">And it is in this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where we first moved in. </sentence><sentence id="375">In December of 1941 a young man came into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="376"> Next to our <span class="building">house</span> was a <span class="building">wooden house</span>, larger, with more <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and naturally more people lived there -- crowded, one on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="377">And there was a young man that I knew that I really knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same <span class="building">school</span> that I did, but he was older. </sentence><sentence id="378">He was in a higher grade -- came in one evening and he brought with him a fellow that was, I thought, so much older than I was, and he introduced me and he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="379">He said his name Aron Dereczynski. </sentence><sentence id="380">They called him Arkie and he kept on coming, and there was a friendship that developed. </sentence><sentence id="381">He worked in the Verpflegungsamt(r). </sentence><sentence id="382">Did he have a chance really to have food? </sentence><sentence id="383">Do I really need to explain and to tell the value of food in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> when there was such hunger? </sentence><sentence id="384">When a slice of bread meant -- when everyone aspired to have enough. </sentence><sentence id="385">And my sister liked him right away. </sentence><sentence id="386">My father sort of -- since my mother was killed, my aunt was killed, my sister really sort of took the motherly part, even though she wasn't that all -- she was so wonderful to us, so caring. </sentence><sentence id="387">She was a student before the war and I never expected her to come in and to this role, but how beautifully she did it. </sentence><sentence id="388">How kind and nice she was to us. </sentence><sentence id="389">She wasn't really that much older than we were. </sentence><sentence id="390">And as a friendship developed, Aron would come. </sentence><sentence id="391">You know, there was curfew. </sentence><sentence id="392">Nowhere could you have gone or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="393">And meanwhile, terrible things were happening in the <span class="populated

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="396">They would kill somebody. </sentence><sentence id="397">They found a bottle of milk in his possession, and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was tense at the killings. </sentence><sentence id="398">And then --I guess it's a human quality -- people would sort of like relax and it was almost like normalcy. </sentence><sentence id="399">I really don't know why they thought it was normalcy, but the tragedy was a community tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="400">Everybody was in the same shoes. </sentence><sentence id="401">There was no family that wasn't touched. </sentence><sentence id="402">Everybody lost someone and maybe it was at this particular time easier to share the grief because everybody cried. </sentence><sentence id="403">Everybody was in the same position losing their loved ones. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="404">And I developed a friendship with Aron. </sentence><sentence id="405">It was more than a friendship, really -- more than a friendship. </sentence><sentence id="406">It was "boy and girl," even in this abnormal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="407">As time went on in the <span

keep you. </sentence><sentence id="936">You have to think about years, it's not days. </sentence><sentence id="937">This is why the righteous that saved, that kept Jews, some of them for years, are really people that are an exception in this society. </sentence><sentence id="938">They're giants. </sentence><sentence id="939">They are giants. </sentence><sentence id="940">They are to emulate -- a whole world must learn to emulate. </sentence><sentence id="941">They were the people with morals with consciousness and they wanted to help and to do -- do not kill. </sentence><sentence id="942">Do not kill. </sentence><sentence id="943">Be your brother's keeper. </sentence><sentence id="944">Aron -- Herschel parted with his father and his niece and his cousin. </sentence><sentence id="945">Aron went with him to the <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="946">By this time already Aron knew <span class="populated place">Tadek</span>, and the idea was when Herschel and Lutek will arrive to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> that they will send back a note with Tadek to tell everyone that they had arrived safely. </sentence><sentence id="947">Well, they arrived safely but they did not send the note, and Aron didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="948">So he was reluctant to believe Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="949">Tadek gave him the kind of story that either you want to believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="950">He said he took them to the Polish family. </sentence><sentence id="951">They were afraid to keep them because even though Lutek, his Polish was perfect, but he had Semitic looks, which is true by the way. </sentence><sentence id="952">It was true. </sentence><sentence id="953">And the family was afraid to keep them. </sentence><sentence id="954">So he said, "I took them to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to the perimeter of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="955">He says, "I show them where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is and they walked into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">They told me that they would come and give me a note to give back to <span class="populated place">Aron</span>." </sentence><sentence id="957">Says, "It poured, it rained. </sentence><sentence id="958">I waited and waited for the note and they never showed up. </sentence><sentence id="959">Here I come to tell you that they are in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> but I don't have a note." </sentence><sentence id="960">Well, Aron already had hesitations, "Should I believe him or should I believe him?" </sentence><sentence id="961">But he left it. </sentence><sentence id="962">Tadek kept on coming and kept on coming and bartering and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was not quiet any more. </sentence><sentence id="963">There were talks about <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and people already expected this <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, and already they begin to loom that these people are not going to be resettled. </sentence><sentence id="964">That there is some thought, "They're sending them some place, to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="965">And do you know what they do to most of them?That they gas them. </sentence><sentence id="966">Gas them in 20th century? </sentence><sentence id="967">It must be. </sentence><sentence id="968">How could it be? </sentence><sentence id="969">How could it be?Yes, yes, yes, yes, it can be, it can be." </sentence><sentence id="970">And it already begin to work on people and people already begin to believe. </sentence><sentence id="971">But so little could they have done to avoid the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">So little could they have done to avoid the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="973">One day Tadek came and tells Aron at work, "Aron, the <span

escaped the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> of 5,000. " </sentence><sentence id="976">They are taking the Jews to resettlement and I doubt if you will have a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="977">Come with me to <span class="populated

back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="982">Well, Aron listen to Tadek and he said, "What should I do? </sentence><sentence id="983">I have nobody in the world left. </sentence><sentence id="984">I left a mother and three sisters in <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> -- on the way to <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">The only person," he says, "that I really have ties to is Lisa. </sentence><sentence id="986">Should I leave her too and go to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>, to go to the unknown?" </sentence><sentence id="987">By this time already he almost has said he resigned. </sentence><sentence id="988">He said, "What is life altogether? </sentence><sentence

worked with sort of were suspicious that he might go away with this Christian, and they worried because they were counted. </sentence><sentence id="995">And this too -- was a tragedy that we are responsible one for another. </sentence><sentence id="996">If 10 people walked out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, 10 had to return. </sentence><sentence id="997">If nine returned, they took hostages and they killed people. </sentence><sentence id="998">And you had this tremendous responsibility of the whole <span class="populated place">community</span>, and it's not only said that they would take hostage. </sentence><sentence id="999">They did take hostages and they killed people. </sentence><sentence id="1000">They killed people. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They came

id="1864">A: We arrived in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> and we were able to go in into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> without any problem. </sentence><sentence id="1865">Tadek walked with us. </sentence><sentence id="1866">He told us to cover our faces with soot so we would look like railroad workers coming from work or something, and he said, "As soon as you see a group of Jews returning from the nightshift, from work, try to jump in, in their midst and walk into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1867">And we walked with Tadek for awhile and all of a sudden we see a group of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1868">Of course, worker Jews because they walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, not on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> and they all had yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="1869">We went into their midst and we walked in into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1870">This was the last time on this voyage that we saw <span class="populated place">Tadek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1871">We came in into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and Jewish police immediately took us over. </sentence><sentence id="1872">And as the Jewish police took us over they took us into Dessler!(r) and to <span class="populated place">Gens</span>" in order for us to receive rations, a piece of bread that everybody needed and a bowl of soup and also, a place where to put your head down. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I'm not talking about a <span class="interior space">room</span>, but a place, a piece of <span class="interior space">floor</span> to put your head down. </sentence><sentence id="1874">You had to be registered within the <span class="building">Judenrat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Dessler cautioned us not to tell anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Of course, we told him the story, that we are -- about the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> and we still had a story to tell him about <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> and then <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> about the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1877">Also, he said, "You have to be very quiet, not to tell people, not to put the <span

different. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Here it's different, and don't jeopardize your ration cards and do as we tell you to do." </sentence><sentence id="1881">Needless to tell you, neither of us listened to what he had to say. </sentence><sentence id="1882">We spoke our mind and told people exactly what happened in <span class="populated place">Slonim</span>, what happened in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, and by this time already people in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> knew too, because it was already after <span class="populated place">Ponar</span> and a lot of killings in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> but the situation there was still different. </sentence><sentence id="1883">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was still vital. </sentence><sentence id="1884">There was still quite a large <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1885">Icame in. </sentence><sentence id="1886">I was immediately -- I was told where my father and my little brother are and I immediately ran there to be with them. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Can you imagine the joy of my father to have me come to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1888">Now, Aron immediately found a group of people that came from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1889">They were together with me. </sentence><sentence id="1890">There were nine men and a girl. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I was the only girl. </sentence><sentence id="1892">So they all lived together and they were called in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> "The Grodno Group." </sentence><sentence id="1893">They all sort of were dressed the same and they were called "the Grodno Group" and they all lived ina <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1894">They had one <span class="interior space">room</span> with another married -- with a couple and the couple's sister. </sentence><sentence id="1895">So you can imagine how many people in one, in one <span class="interior space">room</span> lived. </sentence><sentence id="1896">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> -- people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that came to me as a total surprise. </sentence><sentence id="1897">There was a <span class="building">library</span> where you could go and take out books or sit and study. </sentence><sentence

id="1903">My father worked outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So did my little brother -- used to go out and I too, for the first time went out

Jews that worked there, so he wasn't very harsh on us. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And the Germans didn't watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1913">We somehow could always, always finagle a little bit, where we could steal a radish or a carrot and eat it real fast and try to get rid of the green part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And it is there where I worked. </sentence><sentence id="1915">The man that was our foreman, the Jewish foreman, always used to go away and leave us. </sentence><sentence id="1916">I was very, at times, angry. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I say, "Why does he do it? </sentence><sentence id="1918">Why does he do it?" </sentence><sentence id="1919">Little did I know. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Much later in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> where I met him that he was part of the Jewish resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1921">But I didn't know when I worked with him. </sentence><sentence id="1922">The man never told us or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1923">He evidently was trying to do something for the resistance on the outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1924">So I worked -- Aron worked inside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and very much our hope was only the resistance and the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1925">We knew that we can not survive in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And because it was still a large <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in numbers and there was still quite a young people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we tried to look every possible way to get in touch with the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Do you know, before the war was known for this -- it was called "the <span class="populated place">Wilno Jerusalem</span> of Lithuanian." </sentence><sentence id="1928">There was such a strong nucleus, culture in Jewish and in every, every aspect of Jewish life in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> that we were convinced that there must be an <span class="interior space">underground</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1929">And when Aron worked with one of the men in the <span class="building">shop</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> he realized that he's -- that they do something there. </sentence><sentence id="1930">That it's always producing a part, a part, a part and the minute the foreman, the German foreman, would walk in they would immediately hide. </sentence><sentence id="1931">He learned later that they were making some parts for armaments in this <span class="building">shop</span>, that they were really working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And besides Aron there was another man that had contacts in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> and from both sides, somehow, they contacted the Jewish resistance and the resistance took us in because they were all young men, unattached with no families, and we became part of the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1933">It was very, very secretive. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I could not tell my father, neither I could tell my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And then the story of <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span>"! </sentence><sentence id="1936">developed in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where a Communist, a Polish Communist was caught on the outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and within his torture he gave out <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> as the leader of the Jewish resistance in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Now, the <span class="building">Judenrat</span> played both ends of the picture. </sentence><sentence id="1938">They were with the <span class="spatial object">resistors</span> and they were with the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1939">Gens had a notion because in 1943 when we came to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the <span class="region">Russian Front</span> already and Gens had a thought that if the resistors do not bring in the destruction of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the people might survive. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors. </sentence><sentence id="1941">So he wanted to convince the resistance to "don't rock the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1942">And even though he knew there was resistance, so he played both ends. </sentence><sentence id="1943">But he convinced the population of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that, "the resistors will bring down your end." </sentence><sentence id="1944">And the population of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And then this tremendous play with <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> developed and as we know from history now from the <span class="populated place">Wilno ghetto</span> that <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> was turned over to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1946">He committed suicide and
