<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> was -- luckily <span class="populated place">Krakew</span> was not touched. </sentence><sentence id="97">It was not destroyed y -- like other <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">Like <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="99"><span class="populated place">Krakew</span> was not destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the Germans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where -- were mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th -- main thing to eliminate those things. </sentence><sentence id="100">So <span class="populated place">Krakew</span> wasn't destroyed, but our -- our da -- duty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people

</sentence><sentence id="103">Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were some who remained. </sentence><sentence id="104">But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people, but during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their grandfather was from <span class="country">Germany</span>, or great grandfather was a colonist. </sentence><sentence id="105">And e -- sometimes even if it was not true. </sentence><sentence id="106">They wanted to do it, why? </sentence><sentence id="107">Because doing this they became ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get a nicer <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and they could get a good job. </sentence><sentence id="108">Even the Polish people who were sent away to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and they were -- didn't have the rice, they had more rice, and they were the elite during the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="109">Now, as the Germans left, those people tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. </sentence><sentence id="110">So naturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. </sentence><sentence id="111">If they came from different <span class="populated place">towns</span>, if they started having new papers. </sentence><sentence id="112">So mostly this was our aim, and this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our place. </sentence><sentence id="113">So this was the main things that we had to have. </sentence><sentence id="114">Then I got an -- a special job. </sentence><sentence id="115">This was -- now we occupied <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>,

id="121">And the head of this group was Hewlett Johns -- Johnson. </sentence><sentence id="122">He was the Dean of <span class="populated place">Canterbury</span> from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">He was a archbishop and he was the head. </sentence><sentence id="124">And he had in his group mostly professors from different <span class="building">universities</span>, from <span class="country">countries</span> who were not a g -- who -- who didn't work with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="125">Like in Europe a lot of <span class="country">countries</span> collaborated, and they had armies like <span class="country">Hungary</span>, <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">Those were professors from places that they were always against the Germans, or the Germans were occupying their <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">We had professors from <span class="country">Russia</span>, from <span class="country">England</span>, from -- from <span class="country">Argentina</span>, from all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="128">And I was assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day's activity for this group where to go. </sentence><sentence id="129">We went to all <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, to -- like for instance, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> maybe two weeks after <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="130">Everything was fresh. </sentence><sentence id="131">The de -- the destruction of the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>, they we -- still were hot from -- from -- from fire. </sentence><sentence id="132">The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they were still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn't dry up. </sentence><sentence id="133">And then th-the -- the <span class="building">warehouses</span> from children's shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those thing. </sentence><sentence id="134">This was just in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="135">And we found in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> also, about 20 to thir -- 25,000 people who couldn't be sent out with the death marches like they did before the Russians occupied. </sentence><sentence id="136">So I went with this group for about four, five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="137">This is a verbatim

have the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and the transportation for the group. </sentence><sentence id="141">And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me out and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation from the Dean of <span class="populated place">Canterbury</span>, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those places. </sentence><sentence id="142">During the times that we went to the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, there was a other aim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very happy with the communists who came in. </sentence><sentence id="143">Now this, everything was staged, nothing was the truth. </sentence><sentence id="144">Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname, the Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-Russia. </sentence><sentence id="145">When he went, for instance to <span

Jews came back, they had nothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with them, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic, because in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman, each individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing, they didn't change.
