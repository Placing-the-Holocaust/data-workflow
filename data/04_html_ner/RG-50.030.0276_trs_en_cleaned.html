<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you be so kind to tell us your name, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is David Wasserman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: When and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="country">Romania</span> in the City <span class="populated place">Focsani</span> (ph) in March 14, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Please tell us a few words about your family, what was the profession of your parents, and your years during your childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, although I was born in <span class="populated place">Focsani</span>, we moved to <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> in 1937. </sentence><sentence id="14">My parents -- my father had a <span class="building">wine store</span>, and my mom was a housewife. </sentence><sentence id="15">I had two little brothers, they were twins. </sentence><sentence id="16">And we lived in that <span class="populated place">town</span> from 1937 until 1932, the day of my deportation. </sentence><sentence id="17">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">I went to the <span class="building">Gymnasium Comanesti</span>, which is a <span class="building">business school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">And there was no visible anti-Semitism at that time. </sentence><sentence id="20">I'm talking about "37, "38. </sentence><sentence id="21">Of course, this changed later on in 1939, 1940 when the political situation in <span class="country">Romania</span> changed to the extreme right. </sentence><sentence id="22">And then the anti-Semitism was more copious. </sentence><sentence id="23">The Jewish people were actually expelled from <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">We didn't have the right to study anymore, to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">I began to <span class="building">private school</span>, it was a small <span class="populated place">town</span> and we didn't have any <span class="building">private schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">In order to go to a <span class="building">private school</span>, we had to go to the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Botosani</span>, which was 40 kilometers from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">So when I was expelled from <span class="building">school</span>, it was very tragic moment in my life because I thought I had good friends with which I had been studying. </sentence><sentence id="28">And at the time when we were told that the Jewish people had no more rights to go to <span class="building">school</span>, I was chased out and beaten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: When did this happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: That happened in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="48">I was very depressed, and I was teenager at that time, and I was very depressed, as I said, by the fact that so quickly it can changed, the situation and the hate toward us for the only reason we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="49">This is a sad memory in my life pertaining to my education, so I just couldn't finish all my education at that time. </sentence><sentence id="50">I finished about, at that time, there was the fourth grade of <span class="building">Gymnasium Comanesti</span>, which is equivalent of eighth grade here or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Can you be so kind to describe to us a little bit, elaborate a little bit on what happened to you during the days when you were expelled from <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: When I was expelled from <span class="building">school</span>, my colleagues were going to <span class="building">school</span>, and we were actually had to go to our own with tutoring. </sentence><sentence id="58">I mean we just hired a tutor and he in his spare hours brought us up and updated to the education which we didn't have a chance to follow. </sentence><sentence id="59">And I just didn't lose too much in education because I just did it on my own, but many of my  colleagues didn't have the kind of ambition which I had. </sentence><sentence id="60">And then we had to go and perform various sort of work in order to maintain the sustaining a living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Did you go every day 40 kilometers to <span class="populated place">Botosani</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: No, I didn't go to <span class="populated place">Botosani</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">I did it in <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> with a private tutor. </sentence><sentence id="69">That's what I just mentioned because it was too far away, and we didn't have the money to spend to go every day for 40 kilometers, or to stay there would have been an additional burden. </sentence><sentence id="70">There were three children in the <span class="building">house</span>, and we just couldn't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="71">But I did it on my own, and I tried - - at that time we didn't know how long it would take this time. </sentence><sentence id="72">We hoped it was going to be a transitory period where Jewish people would be readmitted in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">But the truth was that the situation got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="74">The Iron Guard and and all this political  next day we just went out, and we found out about the atrocities which happened in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and in some <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">This I remember from my own, nobody has to tell me because I remember. </sentence><sentence id="76">I was at that time 16 years -- 15 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: Could you tell us what happened to you and your family when the military operations against <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> started in June 1941? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: In June 1941, it started already to aggravate our situation. </sentence><sentence id="90">First of all, there were orders to take away the <span class="building">stores</span> from the Jewish people and it was a process of nationalization or Rumanization where my father had to give away the <span class="building">store</span> and many of the Jewish merchants. </sentence><sentence id="91">And we had to move out from that location and move to a different location. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Can you elaborate a little bit on what happened to the business of your father . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: It was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="98">My father had to train first a certain individual who eventually took over the <span class="building">business</span> without any compensation. </sentence><sentence id="99">And because we lived with our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the same address, we had to move out. </sentence><sentence id="100">And we moved to another <span class="dlf">street</span>, a much smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, which we couldn't really afford anymore. </sentence><sentence id="101">We didn't have any income. </sentence><sentence id="102">There was no welfare or things like that there, and you had to live on your own or family or friends who wanted to help you. </sentence><sentence id="103">We didn't have too much help, just a little bit of saving that we had that we had to go through. </sentence><sentence id="104">And later on we heard that there's going to be a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but because of the situation and the position of <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>, we didn't have enough <span class="interior space">apartments</span> to accommodate the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="105">So we were locked in our <span class="building">houses</span>, and we were permitted only one hour a day to go and shop to the <span class="building">bazaar</span>, to the open <span class="building">bazaar</span>, the <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">From 8 to 9 in the morning, that was the hour when Jewish people in <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> could actually go and <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">And at that particular time the prices were so high because nobody else went to buy from 8 to 9 from the Rumanian population. </sentence><sentence id="108">And the prices were high, were speculative. </sentence><sentence id="109">And not only that, I remember that walking in those <span class="dlf">streets</span>, we were actually beaten and spit upon by our neighbors actually. </sentence><sentence id="110">That was the tragedy because we thought that we have good friends and good neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="111">But all of a sudden, this condition changed. </sentence><sentence id="112">So we had to run to the <span class="building">market</span> and <span class="building">shop</span> in one hour and run back. </sentence><sentence id="113">Go to the <span class="building">bakery</span>, there was no <span class="building">supermarkets</span> or <span class="building">grocery</span> like now -- we had to go to the <span class="building">market</span> to buy the food and vegetables and the meat and then the <span class="building">bakery</span> and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="114">So many times, like myself and my dad and mom, had to go in different places to <span class="building">shop</span> so we can have our products. </sentence><sentence id="115">This I remember also. </sentence><sentence id="116">So it was very sad that we had to go through that. </sentence><sentence id="117">And in 1941 -- coming back to your question -- 1941 was the first deportation from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> where people were told that -- at that time <span class="country">Romania</span> was occupying a part of <span class="country">Ukraine</span> by pushing the Russians back. </sentence><sentence id="118">And the <span class="region">territory</span> from the <span class="dlf">Dnestr</span> to the <span class="dlf">Bug</span> was given to the Rumanian administration. </sentence><sentence id="119">And the Rumanian government of at that time said that all the Jews in <span class="populated place">Bucovina</span> to be deported to  regard, regard, was included in <span class="populated place">Bucovina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">And, therefore, we had the unfortunate  them, and we were placed in a <span class="building">synagogue</span> until they collected more Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="121">And after that, we were transported to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and placed in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">And that was another disastrous event, this story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: When did this happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: This happened in June 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Can you describe how you were transported by <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> from where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: This is a really sad story because they locked us in in these <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">And we were pressed against each other there, and just locked in. </sentence><sentence id="157">Just locked in and left us there the whole night. </sentence><sentence id="158">We were there in the day, and we were staying there all night. </sentence><sentence id="159">And the people were screaming and knocking on the <span class="dlf">door</span> to let us out for personal necessities. </sentence><sentence id="160">They didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="161">There were Rumanian soldiers who were guarding us, and they threatened that if we really scream or so, they were going to shoot us all. </sentence><sentence id="162">So what I remember the stench, the urine all over, and all the bodily wastes in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> was absolutely disastrous. </sentence><sentence id="163">I believed that we were going to die that night without knowing where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="164">So in the morning the <span class="spatial object">train</span> moved and we stopped in an open <span class="dlf">field</span> -- I don't know exactly where it was -- but they let us go out for necessities. </sentence><sentence id="165">And even then, we were told that we have to be in a <span class="dlf">perimeter</span> close so that they can be watching us, the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="166">And everybody, men and women, had to perform their bodily function in front of each other. </sentence><sentence id="167">That was one of the worst degradations which I saw at that time through the eyes of a teenager, which I couldn't comprehend really. </sentence><sentence id="168">Water -- at the same time, there was a <span class="dlf">well</span> of water there, and we were running to the water to fill in some <span class="spatial object">bottles</span> that we had. </sentence><sentence id="169">And back to the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, beaten for no reason, and locked in again in those <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we were traveling for two nights, and when we arrived we saw that it was <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>, which I knew that was 60 kilometers from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">So what was the purpose of running with us for two nights, two days? </sentence><sentence id="172">Well, perhaps they wanted really to punish us in any way, possible way they could at a <span class="region">local level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">I remember there was instruction from the Chief of Police was Mr. McCure (ph), which I remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="174">He was a very bad guy. </sentence><sentence id="175">Either he gave the instruction to do this for us or instruction above his head, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="176">But anyway, once we arrived in <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>, we looked at each one, and we just couldn't believe what we see. </sentence><sentence id="177">Men unshaved and women with their hair and shaven and all these things, and it was really a tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="178">So we were placed on <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, horse and <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>, and we were told that we are going to <span class="populated place">Sagaguda</span> (ph) which was a suburban location near <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">We went through <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> through the local <span class="dlf">streets</span> -- <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> is a big <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">I don't know if you know. </sentence><sentence id="181">And we went through the local <span class="dlf">streets</span> and we were brought to <span class="populated place">Sagaguda</span> (ph) where we met other Jewish people there from <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> who were also prepared to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="182">That was another question. </sentence><sentence id="183">Their authorization was not respected, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="184">We spoke to people there, the authorization you took them from their <span class="building">houses</span>, there was not our case anymore. </sentence><sentence id="185">And in <span class="populated place">Sagaguda</span> (ph), we were permitted for the first time to go to a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and to wash our faces, which we realized how little it takes to degrade a person and to lower the morale, and just be happy to have a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">So from <span class="populated place">Sagaguda</span> together with the people from <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>, the Jewish people, we  were transported to the <span class="building">Stadium of Maccabi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">There. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Wait, where are they sending you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: In <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">In <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">There we were actually going through a kind of customs regulation, so-called, where we were told to give all our money and to be exchanged for Deutsche marks, German marks which were the currency in effect in <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">They were not Rumanian. </sentence><sentence id="227">And we were paid a certain amount of money, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="228">And the rest of them and all of us, we were told that from that point we will go over the <span class="dlf">Dnestr</span> to <span class="region">Transnistria territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">There is another tragedy there because when we arrived at the <span class="building">Dnestr</span>, they placed us in <span class="spatial object">rowboats</span>, no <span class="dlf">bridge</span> to cross. </sentence><sentence id="230">We're just in <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">Each <span class="spatial object">boat</span> had two <span class="spatial object">seats</span> and they pushed -- I don't know -- 10, 12 people in each <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">And they were rowing the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to the other side of the <span class="dlf">Dnestr</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">In the middle of the <span class="env feature">river</span>, the soldiers said if we were not giving them any kind of valuables we had with us, they will by mistake overturn the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">So people were panicking and whatever they had -- pens or <span class="spatial object">fountain pens</span> or watches or rings were given the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="235">And, finally, they brought us over. </sentence><sentence id="236">When everybody came in <span class="spatial object">boats</span> - - when everybody was over the <span class="dlf">Dnestr</span> already, we were left in an open <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">And luckily for us there was no rain or any kind of weather, which would have really been to our disadvantage. </sentence><sentence id="238">So we slept on the <span class="dlf">field</span> until the next day when they told us that <span class="spatial object">trains</span> will come and pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="239">Already we were afraid of all these things and the conditions, but we have no choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Do you remember the name of the place (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: So let's continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: And the next day after we slept -- after we slept overnight outside, they packed us in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> in exactly the same conditions which we were afraid of would happen. </sentence><sentence id="264">But the distance wasn't very great probably. </sentence><sentence id="265">We arrived, I think the next day. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we were brought to a place where they called <span class="populated place">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) and <span class="populated place">Liege</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">It's a small place there. </sentence><sentence id="268">We understood at that time that this place was a former <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> for the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> for their inmates. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Can you tell us <span class="building">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) means in English when translated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: <span class="dlf">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph) means <span class="interior space">stone caves</span> where people used to break the stones and use them for construction, apparently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: And this was in <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: We did perform any work there, no. </sentence><sentence id="282">This was in <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span>, in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">There was a Rumanian officer, I don't know the name of this guy, there was a very discouraging speech. </sentence><sentence id="284"> They told us that he has orders or information or anything to do with us, and we would stay there indefinitely and probably were going to die. </sentence><sentence id="285">That was the welcome speech which he gave us, so they placed us in the long <span class="building">barracks</span> there on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">And we were there for about four weeks, four, five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="287">And the only thing -- there was no food, and it was just by the <span class="env feature">River Bug</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">We could go and wash ourselves in the <span class="spatial object">Bug</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Do you remember the month? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: The month? </sentence><sentence id="300">Yeah, it was July -- end of June or July because it happened really immediately after our deportation from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">So the officer told us that he will make a favor and permit the local farmers to come on a specific day of the week to give us -- to sell us food. </sentence><sentence id="302">And we had to arrange with them whatever we can on a barter exchange or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="303">And for that accommodation he asked for some kind of compensation, which one of the people became a leguer (ph) and went to collect whatever we had to give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="304">So after about four, five weeks we were there, we just didn't have any more what to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we figured out that since there's no other food and no other provision, we are going to die, especially the farmers told us that in this place died many people before we arrive there. </sentence><sentence id="306">So there was no secret at all that our fate would have been just to die there. </sentence><sentence id="307">One day, it was in August, a small <span class="spatial object">German car</span> arrived with SS officers. </sentence><sentence id="308">They had a skull and the bones and that. </sentence><sentence id="309">And they ordered the Rumanian officer to summons us and bring us up for counting, so we were counted. </sentence><sentence id="310">The counting was just a regular routine, and they told us that they need workers for them to work. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they promised us good accommodations and good food in exchange for work, which it sounded very good at that time in our condition. </sentence><sentence id="312">And we just kind of accepted this offer, we had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="313">Either we die there or we go and work and getting something for it. </sentence><sentence id="314">Little as we knew at that time what the Germans were actually doing and what they did with the Jews in <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">So the next day was a program to transport us to the Germans, which the Rumanian officer told us that the next day we're going to be ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="316">So they brought some <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> -- again, horse and <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> for the bags that we each one had, and the people had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="317">Where, we didn't know where. </sentence><sentence id="318">We were told that we were going to a point where the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> will wait for us to bring us to the various locations. </sentence><sentence id="319">So the guards were Lithuanian, which were by themselves were very bad people, and they supervised us to walk. </sentence><sentence id="320">And we were walking and they ordered us to walk faster and faster and running. </sentence><sentence id="321">There were some people there, there were elderly people, there were women, there were children; they couldn't run. </sentence><sentence id="322">So some people fainted or were exhausted and they fell to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, which we witnessed and we were actually told to move. </sentence><sentence id="323">We heard some shots, we assumed they were warning shots for the people to run faster. </sentence><sentence id="324">But when we arrived at that place we realized that those people who fell didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="325">There were some questions, where were those people? </sentence><sentence id="326">They said they would bring them later with the <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">They never did. </sentence><sentence id="328">And when we came there and we saw the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> lined up, <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And we were told to go and pick up our belongings which were in a big pile. </sentence><sentence id="330">And each one tried desperately to pick up their own <span class="spatial object">bag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">They gave us half-hour to identify our <span class="spatial object">bag</span> and take possession of them. </sentence><sentence id="332">And there was really -- terrible sad how people were actually jumping on each other to just pick up the <span class="spatial object">bags</span> and find them and go. </sentence><sentence id="333">We heard laughing, we saw people photographing us, and finally we were pushed in those <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">We  tried to keep together, my parents and my brothers because they were taking just people and pushing them in the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> without relation or family connection or something. </sentence><sentence id="335">So we tried to keep together and we were together. </sentence><sentence id="336">And we were pushed in those <span class="spatial object">truck</span> -- I don't remember how many <span class="region">territory</span> people in one <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, the Lithuanian, the same guards. </sentence><sentence id="337">And we crossed the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="338">For the first time we saw a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and we were told by them that we're going to a <span class="populated place">city</span> named <span class="populated place">Giessen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">It meant nothing to us. </sentence><sentence id="340">When we arrived there and we saw already the condition there. </sentence><sentence id="341">We saw the people that were in the same condition as we were when we got out of the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="342">And we realized that this is going to be our future, and forget about the good food and the -- giiten essen, giiten flagel (ph). </sentence><sentence id="343">We used to say good food and good <span class="building">accommodation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">So two <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came in, and we were waiting to be tried and brought over. </sentence><sentence id="345">After a wait for about 15, 20 minutes, they came and they told us that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was full and they had no <span class="interior space">room</span> for us anymore and they have to bring us to a different location. </sentence><sentence id="346">So the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> turned around, and we moved back to the same <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">And on the way back, I witnessed -- we witnessed a really big tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="348">Because there was a beautiful young girl about maybe 15 or so, and the Lithuanian were looking at her all the time. </sentence><sentence id="349">And finally the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> stopped in the <span class="region">middle of nowhere</span>, and they pulled her out, both she and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="350">They both starting to scream, terrible, and they raped her, all four guards. </sentence><sentence id="351">So when she came back, she looked terrible, poor girl. </sentence><sentence id="352">She was one of our group which eventually -- I want to relate -- eventually she was killed later on. </sentence><sentence id="353">But this is later on. </sentence><sentence id="354">Sorry about that. </sentence><sentence id="355">So when we were brought back almost the same place as we start, and crossing back the <span class="spatial object">Bug</span>, little as we know -- little as knew at that time that that was our chance to survive the Holocaust is because we did not -- we were not admitted in <span class="populated place">Giessen Camp</span>, where we found out that nobody survived in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">Everybody was shot and killed. </sentence><sentence id="357">So we were brought back over the Bug back, and we were told that the <span class="populated place">town</span> where we are there, it's called <span class="populated place">Brasov</span>, which, again, meant nothing to us at that time. </sentence><sentence id="358">In this little <span class="populated place">town</span> with about 2,000 people that we lived, they had two <span class="populated place">German camps</span> run by the <span class="building">Tort Organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">One <span class="populated place">camp</span> was <span class="populated place">Dortmund Camp</span>, we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="360">And the other one was <span class="populated place">Herzogenbusch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">We were placed in <span class="populated place">Herzogenbusch Camp</span>, all together were about 2,000 people, and ours was the bigger <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which we realized later on. </sentence><sentence id="362">And when we were brought there, the same thing like in <span class="populated place">Giessen</span>, the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> with the same unfortunate people which we saw already there. </sentence><sentence id="363">And we realized that those were people from <span class="populated place">Brasov</span>, Jewish people who lived in <span class="populated place">Brasov</span> and in the surrounding <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">And they were the first to be locked in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">So when we came in, we saw all the Lithuanian guards there. </sentence><sentence id="366">A whole army, I mean just many, many of them. </sentence><sentence id="367">And they said that this is going to be our <span class="building">place of work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">They put us in <span class="dlf">line</span>, they counted us again, and then they told us that we are going to be separated men from women. </sentence><sentence id="369">They would be given separate <span class="building">dormitories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">And the sanitary facilities was an open <span class="dlf">trench</span> where men and women together had to use it. </sentence><sentence id="371">The degradation was getting from bad to worse. </sentence><sentence id="372">We were told by the German commander that this is the place where we're going to work. </sentence><sentence id="373">We are going to work six days a week. </sentence><sentence id="374">We are going to walk to work about five, six kilometers, I believe it was the distance. </sentence><sentence id="375">And they expect us to perform to their standards. </sentence><sentence id="376">And if not, then we're going to pay with our lives. </sentence><sentence id="377">The food rations was a half a bread per person per week distributed on a Sunday when we were not working. </sentence><sentence id="378">Every morning we used to get a cup of hot water called tea. </sentence><sentence id="379">I think they put some branches and leaves from the local <span class="env feature">trees</span>, no sugar. </sentence><sentence id="380">And at <span class="building">work</span> we used to get a soup a day at noontime, mostly peas. </sentence><sentence id="381">I ate  so much peas in those years and no meat. </sentence><sentence id="382">And when we came <span class="building">home</span>, back walking <span class="building">home</span> we got the same ration as in the morning, a cup of hot water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: What kind of work did you perform there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: We broke stones. </sentence><sentence id="470">We went again to a <span class="populated place">Cayara di Piatra</span> (ph), where we really had to work at the <span class="env feature">stones</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">Where -- the purpose of this work really, we realized after a year and a half of working there, we realized that those stones practically never used, but were only a reason for killing us. </sentence><sentence id="472">Because if you didn't perform -- the Germans used to measure the cubic feet of stones, how much each one is supposed to make. </sentence><sentence id="473">And if you didn't make it, they marked you down and the which they had, the first of the people -- the first one was the one  0 you never knew that the 10th is always picked out. </sentence><sentence id="474">So you never knew when it was going to be your day to be killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="489">A: There a guy there -- you see, that the Tort Organization, which had this jurisdiction over our <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, they were not SS people. </sentence><sentence id="490">They were just -- I don't know what kind of -- auxiliary army. </sentence><sentence id="491">They wore some brown khaki uniform, not **marked, not a green one or SS.And the commander who was in charge of day-to-day activity and day-to-day killing was a guy named Karl Rheinger (ph). </sentence><sentence id="492">He, although he was not an SS, he enjoyed very much to have this kind of jobs and the opportunities to come and kill. </sentence><sentence id="493">He killed personally people which I'm going to tell you later on. </sentence><sentence id="494">And together with Mikel Cromer (ph), which was an SS policia, the auxiliary SS who actually was the commander, the field commander. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't know exactly what grade the rank was. </sentence><sentence id="496">And he was responsible for the SS people, but Karl Rheinger was in charge of the day-to-day operation. </sentence><sentence id="497">Later one we had another German guy, <span class="building">SS policia</span>, his name was Tomachek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="498">He was just a great guy. </sentence><sentence id="499">I have to say that he saved actually lives which I'm going to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="500">It's a lot of story which I can tell. </sentence><sentence id="501">In our place if anybody tried to escape and escaped, 10 people were shot. </sentence><sentence id="502">And this we knew and they told us that we have to watch each other should not escape because if this guy will escape then 10 of us will die. </sentence><sentence id="503">So in addition to the selection at random, in addition to not performing to the standards, we had to think of 10 people to die for one who escaped. </sentence><sentence id="504">Well, I remember a sad story about the six people who were actually killed in our place. </sentence><sentence id="505">They escaped and at the morning count when they saw that the six people are missing Karl Rheinger told us that when we come back, 60 would be shot and now go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="506">So can you imagine how we did work on that day? </sentence><sentence id="507">How we did walk to the <span class="populated place">working place</span> thinking that when we come back, 60 people would be dead, and so you couldn't help it really. </sentence><sentence id="508">So that day they came at lunch hour and they picked out 10 -- no, they picked out six men from our ranks from the work, and they were crying and begging for their life. </sentence><sentence id="509">They thought that, and we thought that they changed their minds and instead to kill 60, they would just kill the six. </sentence><sentence id="510">And they took them -- there was real tragedy the way they were screaming. </sentence><sentence id="511">And they took them to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and they told them to dig a <span class="dlf">grave</span> outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, just outside the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">And they did thinking that this is that way. </sentence><sentence id="513">I mean this is normal to think that if you don't see anybody and you know that six people were away and you know that you are selected, so you think that you will die. </sentence><sentence id="514">And those six people after they finished the <span class="dlf">grave</span>, they saw the six people who ran away being brought in. </sentence><sentence id="515">Those people were disrobed, were naked. </sentence><sentence id="516">The original six people were caught on the <span class="dlf">road</span> and brought back. </sentence><sentence id="517">This nobody knew at that time. </sentence><sentence id="518">And they made them run through the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> where they escaped naked. </sentence><sentence id="519">There were four women and two men. </sentence><sentence id="520">And instinctively they covered their <span class="region">private parts</span> and they didn't let them. </sentence><sentence id="521">They told them to run with their hands up. </sentence><sentence id="522">And they were brought and placed in the <span class="dlf">grave</span> face down, and the Lithuanian had the opportunity to kill them one by one, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="523"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="568">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="569">I remember the name of the victims because we worked together with them. </sentence><sentence id="570">Well, let me tell it to finish that story is that one of the ladies who were shot and those people were throwing the <span class="env feature">soil</span> on top of them, she realized apparently that she was not dead. </sentence><sentence id="571">And she got up and she begged the Commandant Karl Rheinger to spare her life, and he actually took his pistol and shot her personally and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="572">So the name of the people, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="573">There was a couple, their name was Mr. and Mrs. Ganzer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="574">Another lady was Mrs. Rosenbaum. </sentence><sentence id="575">The other lady was Mrs. Gotismann (ph). </sentence><sentence id="576">There was a guy, his name was Mr. Goldschmidt; he was a musician I remember in <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> because I used to walk with him to work. </sentence><sentence id="577">And another young lady who her parents were killed. </sentence><sentence id="578">I don't remember the last name, I remember the first name. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was <span class="populated place">Gusta</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="580">And unfortunately those people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="581">I did not relate this event to a previous event where the husband of Mrs. Gotismann was killed previously in the winter of 1942 when Karl Rheinger came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in the middle of the night, and he told us to run around the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="582">Just to run, just to entertain him. </sentence><sentence id="583">And shots were heard, and we didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="584">So when we were pushed back in the <span class="building">barracks</span> and each one knew each other, Frau Gotismann realized that her husband is not there. </sentence><sentence id="585">By the way, he a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="586">It's not important really, but he was a dentist, a professional. </sentence><sentence id="587">And she knocked on the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and asked for her husband. </sentence><sentence id="588">And she was told to keep quiet or she will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="589">So in the morning, she asked again, and he told her the same thing so she kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="590">That was the same Frau -- I say Frau, Mrs. Gotismann who actually decided to run away and she was caught. </sentence><sentence id="591">The other lady, Mrs. Rosenbaum, had an unfortunate situation with her husband previously had a mental breakdown, and he started to scream day and night and he was shot. </sentence><sentence id="592">Again, she felt like doesn't have anything to live for, and she was one of the people who got together to escape. </sentence><sentence id="593">The couple of Mrs. and Mrs. Ganzer, I remember them very well because they two little girls, twins like my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="594">And their daughters together with my brothers were killed and they felt again that they have nothing to live probably. </sentence><sentence id="595">And they tried to take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="596">Now, Goldschmidt, he was a musician. </sentence><sentence id="597">He was very depressed because the Germans crushed his accordion, and for a musician it is terrible thing, apparently, to have this done to you. </sentence><sentence id="598">And again he was very weak. </sentence><sentence id="599">He was very weak. </sentence><sentence id="600">I used to walk with him, and he used to tell me story. </sentence><sentence id="601">I believe he told me that he came to look for some relatives, and he was caught in the avalanche and brought into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="602">And the other lady, the young lady Gusta, which I don't remember the last name. </sentence><sentence id="603">I am very good with names, but I don't remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="604">I was not very familiar with her. </sentence><sentence id="605">Her parents were also killed previously, and she was all alone and she also tried to escaped. </sentence><sentence id="606">I related the tragedy of the six people before the story which I have to tell, but that affect us personally when my little brothers were taken away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: How old they were? </sentence><sentence id="647"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: They were seven years old. </sentence><sentence id="651">They were twins, and they were seven years old. </sentence><sentence id="652">That happened September 23rd, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="653">It was two day after Yom Kippur, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="654">It's a Jewish holiday, Day of Atonement. </sentence><sentence id="655">And from the time we arrived in August until September, they had time to analyze us and prepare listing so everybody who they intend to kill. </sentence><sentence id="656">Incidentally, when we arrived there one of the people who were inmates told my dad that the next day when they will ask you the name and how old you are, be sure that you say that you less than 40. </sentence><sentence id="657">Because they kill everybody who is older than 40. </sentence><sentence id="658">My father was 45 at that time, and my mom was 41. </sentence><sentence id="659">See, at this age you can you are 37 or 36, but people who are 50 or 60 it's very hard to cheat to say that you're 39, so they were doomed. </sentence><sentence id="660">So sure enough, when they asked the name, " ," how old you are and what is your name, my parents told them  3 say that my mamma should have some peace. </sentence><sentence id="661">She was very optimistic and she used to say that we will come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="662">And people thought that mom was maybe out of her mind in thinking that we can ever, every going <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="663">But I believed her and said that eventually we could go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">You know, when you're in a condition like that and you lose your courage, you've lost everything. </sentence><sentence id="665">You have to be courageous, but it's very hard in a sense. </sentence><sentence id="666">So that when I think back really, if I would have to go through this again, I probably wouldn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="667">So we were just practically naked, and my mom made for me a pair of socks from an empty bag of potatoes which used to be thrown away from the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">Potatoes, peas. </sentence><sentence id="669">So I had a pair of pants made of a <span class="spatial object">bag</span>, and I didn't have any shoes, so I had rags wrapped around my feet. </sentence><sentence id="670">I had one day my nose and face frozen, and I could see my nose getting white and they told me that even my face. </sentence><sentence id="671">So I remember that I thought that I'm going to have a <span class="dlf">hole</span> where my nose is, and I'm going to be disfigured. </sentence><sentence id="672">And my dad rubbed my face with snow. </sentence><sentence id="673">He said don't touch with your hands because you may damage your skin. </sentence><sentence id="674">And we were walking in any weather. </sentence><sentence id="675">Rain or snow or frost. </sentence><sentence id="676">I remember some days the Bug was frozen, and the Germans didn't feel like walking so they brought a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="677">And they packed us in the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they drove across the <span class="spatial object">Bug</span> just on the <span class="env feature">ice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">And we were afraid that if something happened, we are going to be the first to die. </sentence><sentence id="679">But it was such a tremendous frost, the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with all those people crossed over and it didn't break. </sentence><sentence id="680">So in this type of condition we had to come back and those days, we couldn't collect any beets from the <span class="dlf">road</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="681">So we had to really be satisfied with what we had. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="682">A: Really, you would be surprised how little you need to survive if your mind is there and hope for the best. </sentence><sentence id="683">This is -- the story is repeated every day, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="684">And there was cases when they were beating their -- a guy who stole from somebody else something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: So you stayed for the whole period of the war under German administration under the Tort Organization Administration? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="690">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="691">Until end of December 1943. </sentence><sentence id="692">At that time there was another important day in our life. </sentence><sentence id="693">We were told that the Rumanian Jews will go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="694">By the way, we didn't have any information about what happened at the front. </sentence><sentence id="695">We realized later that the Germans started to get beaten, and the Russians starting an advance toward their own, recapturing their own <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">And the order came that the Rumanian Jews will be readmitted to <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="697">When we were told that, we just didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="698">We didn't believe it for the only reason that it was not believable that we should go back while the war is still on. </sentence><sentence id="699">And, by the way, we were only 27 survivors in <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>, and the only survivors from any <span class="populated place">labor concentration camp</span> was by the <span class="spatial object">Bug</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">I know for a fact now; at that time we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="701">Nobody survived from the <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="702">Our lucky day was at that time was when we were not admitted in <span class="populated place">Giessen</span> and we were brought back. </sentence><sentence id="703">Although we were under German jurisdiction for all this time, but we were on the <span class="region">Rumanian territory</span> of <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="704">And in <span class="populated place">Brasov</span>, the Rumanian commander, receiving orders probably from the <span class="building">high command</span>, was searching for as many Rumanian Jews as they possibly can find. </sentence><sentence id="705">And they requested the German commanders to look and find out if there is any Rumanian Jews there, and they were told there were 27.Apparently, the Germans could have very easily say that they don't have anybody from  4 <span class="country">Romania</span>, but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="706">So at that day when the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> came in, the same type of <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and they called out names. </sentence><sentence id="707">And they told us the Rumanian Jews should step out from the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="708">We thought that this is the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="709">We thought that this is the time when now the Rumanian Jews are specifically chosen to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="710">And there was really, I remember crying and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="711">But, at the same time, we were already hardened, and said, "Well, if we have to die, we have to die. </sentence><sentence id="712">What can we do?" </sentence><sentence id="713">So we were placed in this <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, the 27 people, and taken out and waving to the other people because I have to say that the <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> Jews and Ukrainian Jews who were with us, they remained there. </sentence><sentence id="714">I believe that there were about a hundred or so people still there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: If my understanding is correct, they tried to bring back only the Jews from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Right, only from <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> and from the and the <span class="dlf">Oder</span> and they tried to correct  5 as we are not killed. </sentence><sentence id="744">And from there they told us that we will go <span class="building">home</span>, and we should forget everything what happened here. </sentence><sentence id="745">And they brought us to the <span class="populated place">Dnestr</span> again with the <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="746">And there they -- I don't know exactly the place where they brought us, and we were brought back to <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747">The <span class="dlf">road</span> and the <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, in the <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> was almost the same thing as when we came back. </sentence><sentence id="748">We realized that -- we didn't realize what happened. </sentence><sentence id="749">Why are we brought <span class="building">home</span> in the same condition as we were brought in? </sentence><sentence id="750">And, but we learned how to wait and have hope and see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="751">So when -- making a long story short, when we were brought back to <span class="populated place">Dorohoi</span> and we saw the name of the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, we were extremely happy. </sentence><sentence id="752">But the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> were still locked, and the same police officer, McCure, was there. </sentence><sentence id="753">And he didn't open the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> for us, and we were there I think the whole night again until the next morning when we were transported with some horse and <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="754">And since nothing changed politically in <span class="country">Romania</span> at that time, we were brought to the same condition as actually when we left. </sentence><sentence id="755">We could not really go to our <span class="building">homes</span> because they were occupied by local population there. </sentence><sentence id="756">So we were accommodated to a <span class="building">synagogue</span> where they transformed in a <span class="building">dormitory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">And we slept in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> for all those months until the Russians actually broke through. </sentence><sentence id="758">I don't remember what month it was. </sentence><sentence id="759">February or March 1944. </sentence><sentence id="760">And at that time many Rumanian families evacuated, being afraid of the Russians, apparently. </sentence><sentence id="761">So then we found our <span class="building">house</span>, but it was empty because the people who lived there took everything out and moved before the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="762">So really our condition didn't change too much, but one of our friends told us to live in his <span class="building">house</span> because he is leaving. </sentence><sentence id="763">So he gave us all his <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and that's where we stayed until in August 1944 when we came back to <span class="populated place">Focsani</span>, back to our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
