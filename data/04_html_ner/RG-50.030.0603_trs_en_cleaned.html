<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: So that probably happened shortly after the Anschluss, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Beforeactually before the Anschluss. </sentence><sentence id="249">It was in between the marchin (ph) because when she left, the man who stamped her papers told my mother, "Be sure to go to the <span class="building">embassy</span> and vote about the Anschluss." </sentence><sentence id="250">He was thinking, Good Aryan, she'll vote yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: For the Anschluss, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: So it was part of, you know, this interim period. </sentence><sentence id="257">And then I have a memory that must have been around Kristallnacht, because I remember comingwalking with my grandmother, and we passed where my <span class="building">kindergarten</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="258">And as I said, it was run by a Jewish organization, and I saw a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> pulling away with the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> from the <span class="building">kindergarten</span> and broken things on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and broken glass. </sentence><sentence id="259">So I think that probably was around that time maybe, Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then the next thing, my father took me to the <span class="dlf">parkI</span> think it was right before he was going to leaveand at first he had thought he would take me along but then </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: To <span class="country">Russia</span>, right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: No, to <span class="country">France</span>, to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">And then I think he got a little bit more realistic, that a sixyearold trying to climb illegally over the <span class="env feature">Alps</span> into <span class="country">Switzerland</span> wouldn't work too well. </sentence><sentence id="264">So that was when he tried to teach me a few words of English, thinking my mother is more likely to be able to get me to join her. </sentence><sentence id="265">My parents realized immediately that there was not a hope if they didn't each go out as quickly as possible and then try and bring me out. </sentence><sentence id="266">So my mother, in <span class="country">England</span>, was trying to get papers for me to join her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
