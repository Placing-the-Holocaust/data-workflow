<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell me your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Barbara Rodbell, currently. </sentence><sentence id="6">My maiden was Lederman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, September 4, 1925. </sentence><sentence id="12">My mother's name was Else <span class="spatial object">Citroen Citon</span>, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from <span class="country">Holland</span> had come from -- to <span class="country">Germany</span> from <span class="country">Holland</span>, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon Sileppe. </sentence><sentence id="13">Her name was Sileppe in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">And so that is how the Dutch family lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because that's where they married. </sentence><sentence id="15">They were three children, the old-- four children actually, the oldest died very -- at 18. </sentence><sentence id="16">She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child, and she had a brain tumor and died. </sentence><sentence id="17">It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he has never seen his mother in anything but black ever after. </sentence><sentence id="18">So I saw her in other clothes, but he never saw her in anything but black as he grew up. </sentence><sentence id="19">At least that's how he sees it. </sentence><sentence id="20">People sees things in different ways. </sentence><sentence id="21">My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively happy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter. </sentence><sentence id="22">Didn't pay attention to anything but painting and art. </sentence><sentence id="23">And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a brother, Hans who also survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="24">The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="25">Each of them had their own story, but they all survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="26">We lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and I had a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="27">And we -- my father was a lawyer, born in <span class="populated place">Hisberg</span>, <span class="region">Silesian</span>, over <span class="region">Silesian</span>, and in <span class="country">Germany</span> and studied in <span class="populated place">Verslomberland</span>, later in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> for his Ph.D. in law. </sentence><sentence id="28">And he had a good practice. </sentence><sentence id="29">And he was quite old really. </sentence><sentence id="30">He was 35 when he married my mother. </sentence><sentence id="31">My mother was 20. </sentence><sentence id="32">That was done that way, that way, in those days. </sentence><sentence id="33">Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my childhood in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> as being wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was -- my father loved <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and we went all over <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> as soon as I could walk. </sentence><sentence id="35">And he showed me absolutely everything. </sentence><sentence id="36">Every little <span class="dlf">corner</span>, and he liked history and music and we went to <span class="building">museums</span> and I still remember where the Rembrandt hung in this <span class="building">museum</span> in Ber-- in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because he loved it so. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I remember the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> from <span class="spatial object">Casovillan trains</span>, and the stories he told me about how <span class="populated place">Casovillan</span> used to have big dinners in those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and he was a very faster easter, <span class="populated place">Casovillan</span> was. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">Nobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was served and everybody had to leave very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="39">This was one of my father's story, stories. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="40">And my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="41">We always went to <span class="country">Holland</span> on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="42">And in 1933, when we went to <span class="country">Holland</span> on vacation, one of my many cousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in <span class="populated place">The Hague</span> said to my mother he felt that she should not go back. </sentence><sentence id="43">This was 1933. </sentence><sentence id="44">And Uncle Biet had, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he had been sent to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> to cover a trial. </sentence><sentence id="45">And nobody in <span class="country">Holland</span> paid in attention to this trial. </sentence><sentence id="46">And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, "Why are you making such a fuss?" </sentence><sentence id="47">And he said, "You pay attention to this trial. </sentence><sentence id="48">This is going to end up  being something quite awful and better everybody pay attention." </sentence><sentence id="49">It was Hitler's trial in 1923. </sentence><sentence id="50">And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="51">Took 10 years til things really heated up. </sentence><sentence id="52">So my mother, who always listened to my father because my father was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, "I think we shouldn't go back." </sentence><sentence id="53">And my father said, "What does a lawyer do in a <span class="country">foreign country</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="54">That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="55">And she said, "Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="56">You'll find something to do. </sentence><sentence id="57">It's -- I really think we should not go back." </sentence><sentence id="58">And so father said, "Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do." </sentence><sentence id="59">I mean he had -- I think he graduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="60">I mean it was -- it was practically impossible for him to start over. </sentence><sentence id="61">He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="62">He got to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and he went into his <span class="building">office</span> and there were his secretaries and his assistants and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="63">There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he could only have Jewish clients. </sentence><sentence id="64">My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish clients. </sentence><sentence id="65">I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had. </sentence><sentence id="66">But he had things like the <span class="building">Mid- European Watch Industry</span>, a___, <span class="building">Swiss Watch industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">He had big companies that were his clients, and now he could not represent them anymore. </sentence><sentence id="68">He packed up. </sentence><sentence id="69">And we could still -- [mean he could <span class="spatial object">ship</span> as much as he wanted to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">And we had two <span class="spatial object">grand pianos</span>, and he sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough <span class="building">house</span> or an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> big enough to hold <span class="spatial object">grand pianos</span> so there was a big change in our standard of living. </sentence><sentence id="71">I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and French and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">And when we got to <span class="country">Holland</span>, of course, we had a little <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">My father had to go back to <span class="building">school</span>, to the -- to the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">He worked for a Dutch . </sentence><sentence id="75">He worked for a Dutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course. </sentence><sentence id="76">He handled the clients who were very much like him who had come to <span class="country">Holland</span> and, you know, he couldn't practice along because he didn't have the Dutch degree. </sentence><sentence id="77">So he went to the <span class="building">university</span>, and I think he was now -- how old was he in "34, 35? </sentence><sentence id="78">He graduated in three years in a foreign language. </sentence><sentence id="79">I was -- we were very proud of him. </sentence><sentence id="80">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="81">He also worked at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="82">There was a big party and everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="83">We are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to <span class="country">Holland</span> and I got to my first <span class="building">school</span>, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank. </sentence><sentence id="84">And they lived right behind us on the . </sentence><sentence id="85">We lived at the which was the back of the same kind of development that they lived in. </sentence><sentence id="86">And we -- we always played at____. </sentence><sentence id="87">That's how we met. </sentence><sentence id="88">And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from <span class="country">Germany</span> the same year and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of course, the kids played. </sentence><sentence id="89">As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Without her, I would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was -- wanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else. </sentence><sentence id="91">So without her saying, "Today, we study," I wouldn't have been able to get through. </sentence><sentence id="92">So here we are in <span class="building">school</span> and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well. </sentence><sentence id="93">She was very smart. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="94">And my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was. </sentence><sentence id="95">He would've like me to become a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my thing. </sentence><sentence id="96">I was more the way my mother's family was. </sentence><sentence id="97">More playful and -- and liked imaginary games and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="98">Let's see, where shall we go now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood. </sentence><sentence id="100">Did you meet Ann Frank too? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know. </sentence><sentence id="102">And Ann came to the <span class="building">house</span> a lot and we went to her <span class="building">house</span> a lot. </sentence><sentence id="103">When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same kind of thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="104">You -- you go around to the people in your <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and you work together for the <span class="building">schools</span> and you do various things and My sister was a lot more serious than Ann was. </sentence><sentence id="105">Anne liked games the way I did. </sentence><sentence id="106">And she liked to play and have imagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily upset, and -- . </sentence><sentence id="107">My sister tried to get along with all that, but it wasn't always easy. </sentence><sentence id="108">Ann was a very difficult child, an extremely difficult child. </sentence><sentence id="109">And not just for her family, but in <span class="building">school</span> and she went to a special <span class="building">school</span>, a <span class="building">Montessori kind of school</span> I think or <span class="populated place">Dalton</span> in one of those two kinds of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">And she did very well there. </sentence><sentence id="111">Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if you ask me. </sentence><sentence id="112">But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at least what I always saw of her was very calm, very deliberate, very, very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="113">Margaret was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="114">Had great big brown eyes -- a very serious person. </sentence><sentence id="115">She would have made a real mark in the world. </sentence><sentence id="116">I know that. </sentence><sentence id="117">Just like my sister. </sentence><sentence id="118">My sister -- .I can't even imagine how wonderful she would have been. </sentence><sentence id="119">She was so smart and so sweet and -- and she was very anxious to be very close to me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="120">She wanted to see what I was doing and later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very -- a lot of good advice for me. </sentence><sentence id="121">This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was just -- and she was so sensible. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was amazing! </sentence><sentence id="123">One of the letters I gave you is from her, and there you will see all that. </sentence><sentence id="124">It's a very good letter. </sentence><sentence id="125">Very, very young girl! </sentence><sentence id="126">Anyway, we had a normal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter and a Dutchman, a Dutch painter, with a enormous German accent, but his nationality was Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="127">He was born in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but at 18 he had to choose whether he wanted to be German or Dutch because he was born in <span class="country">Germany</span> but -- but he had a Dutch passport because of his father. </sentence><sentence id="128">And something in him made him make the right choice and he chose <span class="country">Holland</span> and he went to <span class="country">Holland</span> and -- and lived there even since, and became quite a well known painter and had a very happy life in -- in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">Married a beautiful woman, had a daughter, and I have two very close relatives about my same age. </sentence><sentence id="130">One is his daughter, Paulinka, and one is the daughter of my Uncle Hans, the younger brother of my mother who is Tamara and she is in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">She lives in <span class="country">Israel</span> with her family. </sentence><sentence id="132">And now why was I telling you all this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Family and friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Family and friends. </sentence><sentence id="168">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Can we go back a little bit? </sentence><sentence id="172">I would like to go back just cause it has some relevance to your childhood. </sentence><sentence id="173">There was a group of friends with you and Ann Frank and Margo. </sentence><sentence id="174">You had talked Hanna. </sentence><sentence id="175">You had talked about <span class="populated place">Tummi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And there's a picture all of you playing at the <span class="building">party</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="184">Well </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Tell us about that <span class="dlf">circle</span> and tell us about that party. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Well, these were -- these were mostly -- mostly, because on some of those pictures are also a lot of Dutch kids who were playing also who only were living in the same <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">By the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> was entirely mixed. </sentence><sentence id="188">Wasn't all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="189">Was a completely mixed <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">And as far as I knew the Dutch Jews and the Germans Jews got along very well. </sentence><sentence id="191">And I have just read a book which said that they were really pretty separate when it came to it..you know when things got tight. </sentence><sentence id="192">But I personally have never -- have never experienced that. </sentence><sentence id="193">And when I got to think about it not until I got in with a group of young people who were stridently trying to survive was it really all German? -- </sentence><sentence id="194">at that point I realize it was all German. </sentence><sentence id="195">It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but it was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a <span class="building">German Jewish circle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">This was when we were trying to save ourselves, you understand? </sentence><sentence id="197">As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and was very good relationships between everybody. </sentence><sentence id="198">I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank, who by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had any kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people. </sentence><sentence id="199">And, of course, I was half Dutch anyway. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to <span class="country">Holland</span> and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left <span class="country">Holland</span>, while the Germans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed -- we had a great curfew. </sentence><sentence id="201">We were not allowed in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">And my grandparents and my neighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and everything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not -- not as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food except very limited periods of time during the day. </sentence><sentence id="203">It was the first time that I realized that "Hey. </sentence><sentence id="204">Hey. </sentence><sentence id="205">I'm really German. </sentence><sentence id="206">I'm not really Dutch." </sentence><sentence id="207">I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even aware of it, except when I came from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">I was in the -- I was in the 3rd Grade. </sentence><sentence id="209">I was put into the 3rd Grade. </sentence><sentence id="210">I was eight years old. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I had to write what they called in which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write it down. </sentence><sentence id="212">I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="213">I think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had. </sentence><sentence id="214">That was -- you know, there I realized, you know, that it..that it was hard. </sentence><sentence id="215">And my clothes were all wrong. </sentence><sentence id="216">Because <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was very -- we were very elegant in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="217">I had fur coats and a hat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in those days. </sentence><sentence id="218">In <span class="country">Holland</span>, the kids were pretty much more still more ____, more plain, even in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate. </sentence><sentence id="220">So at some point there, I said to my mother, "This is it. </sentence><sentence id="221">That coat goes." </sentence><sentence id="222">I had a Russian -- I had Russian coat which was embroidered with a Russian hat, you know, with the embroidery around and stuff and I said, "Never am I going to wear this thing again." " </sentence><sentence id="223">You give it away to somebody in <span class="country">Germany</span>." </sentence><sentence id="224">I mean I -- I -- it was too embarrassing. </sentence><sentence id="225">Nobody wore clothes that. </sentence><sentence id="226">So I had to get used to, you know, a lot of things like that. </sentence><sentence id="227">But I had lot more freedom than I had in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">I mean <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was a big <span class="populated place">city</span> and playing out in the <span class="dlf">street</span> was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="229">And it -- it - - it was a very different life. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was a certain kind of freedom and relaxation. </sentence><sentence id="231">I didn't have a  nurse or a governess with me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="232">I could go, you know -- I wasn't supposed to, but I go more or less where I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="233">And it was a more relaxed life. </sentence><sentence id="234">It was very hard for my mother, although I didn't hear her ever complain. </sentence><sentence id="235">And my -- I have a cousin who came to visit the other day from <span class="country">Holland</span> and she's much younger. </sentence><sentence id="236">She was much younger than my mother, and she said that my mother never complained. </sentence><sentence id="237">Never! </sentence><sentence id="238">Never! </sentence><sentence id="239">And -- my mother -- I mean she'd had a -- a cook, a cleaning woman, a maid, a nurse for governess for us. </sentence><sentence id="240">You know, she never had anything like that to do. </sentence><sentence id="241">She did that social work. </sentence><sentence id="242">That's what people did. </sentence><sentence id="243">And of course, not for pay. </sentence><sentence id="244">I mean she did social work and now she had to learn to cook. </sentence><sentence id="245">My mother never knew had to cook. </sentence><sentence id="246">So she -- her mother was there. </sentence><sentence id="247">My -- my grandmother had gone to <span class="country">Holland</span> before my -- my -- my parents and she taught my mother how to cook because my mother didn't know how. </sentence><sentence id="248">And she -- she had -- I think she had some help every day for a few hours, but that was -- I mean for her, it must have been an enormous change. </sentence><sentence id="249">An <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, it had two stories but it was still a relatively small <span class="interior space">apartment</span> compared to what she used to have and -- Of course, she was surrounded by family which she had not -- never had her own family. </sentence><sentence id="250">She had a lot of my father's family, but never much of her own. </sentence><sentence id="251">And here it was very different. </sentence><sentence id="252">And because the family was Dutch, of course, we slid very fast into the Dutch way of life and aside from my father and my mother and for the children, it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="253">So I loved it in -- in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: Well, to my great surprise it seems they were much closer than -- than I had thought because again this cousin from <span class="country">Holland</span> who came to visit recently and who told that my mother was -- was never complaining and working very hard and really wasn't very strong, she was telling me that my sister, Susannah, used to bring Anna -- Ann Frank with her every time they came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="380">And they would visit in -- in <span class="populated place">The Hague</span>, and they would visit in <span class="populated place">Glebare</span>, where they had a little <span class="building">summer house</span>, and they would stay for weeks and she describes on the tape, which by the way, I do have but I didn't bring with me she describes how difficult Anna was. </sentence><sentence id="381">And she says how -- now they were older then. </sentence><sentence id="382">I think -- let me see -- I'm -- I was 16 so my sister was 13, and Anna was maybe 12 at that time. </sentence><sentence id="383">So this is a later period that we are actually talking about now. </sentence><sentence id="384">And she describes that Anna was so very much more developed than my sister. </sentence><sentence id="385">Although my sister was only a year older, and how her interests were so very difficult and how difficult it was to keep her calm and interested and uncomplaining and -- and just regular you know. </sentence><sentence id="386">It's a very cute tape actually that little piece of it about Ann. </sentence><sentence id="387">It -- it was amazing to -- to most people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="388">I mean the book is, but - - but I could see a little bit of that I could see that she was thinking about many things. </sentence><sentence id="389">She thought about boys way before Susie ever dreamed of boys. </sentence><sentence id="390">And -- and she -- she would tell me that Susie is really very childish. </sentence><sentence id="391">Susie would say to me, "Ann is just silly. </sentence><sentence id="392">Always with these boys. </sentence><sentence id="393">Who watches that," she says. </sentence><sentence id="394">You know, she didn't want to play. </sentence><sentence id="395">So that's why I was surprised when I heard that at the very end even Ann would go with Susie visiting of -- our family and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="396">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="397">The families were very close. </sentence><sentence id="398">I mean it was due to the fact that it got -- .they're at the time and they were in the same same age more or less. </sentence><sentence id="399">The children were the same age. </sentence><sentence id="400">The interests were a lot alike. </sentence><sentence id="401">My father was a lawyer and -- and Otto, of course, had a business. </sentence><sentence id="402">I don't know if my father worked for him or anything or if he did any of his work, but I'm sure he helped him if there were any problems. </sentence><sentence id="403">So there were a lot of -- a lot of reasons that our families were close. </sentence><sentence id="404">One forgets, you know. </sentence><sentence id="405">One forgets how -- how logical these things develop. </sentence><sentence id="406">There's nothing special. </sentence><sentence id="407">On that other tape that I gave you, Barry Spaanyard keeps asking the mother of Hanna -- Hanna's mother -- keeps saying, "Now how come you didn't know Anna so well? </sentence><sentence id="408">Anna's family. </sentence><sentence id="409">How come you didn't know the <span class="building">Frank's</span> so well? </sentence><sentence id="410">Or how come you didn't -- " And she finally gets impatient with him and she said, "Well, we were families with the Ledermann's and it was just through them that Anna Frank came to play with us." </sentence><sentence id="411">They were not that friendly. </sentence><sentence id="412">I mean it's just -- why should be friend -- nobody is friendly with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="413">So there was no special reason or dislike or like or anything. </sentence><sentence id="414">You know, people know each other or they don't know each other. </sentence><sentence id="415">So that's was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: What..what were the the Frank parents like. </sentence><sentence id="454">Otto -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Uh Well, I said already, you know, how fantastic Otto was. </sentence><sentence id="456">He was wonderful with children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: The <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="803">The <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="804">Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big speech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free <span class="country">country</span> and we shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and. </sentence><sentence id="805">Anyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody, of course, told on him. </sentence><sentence id="806">They were fascists in the <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="807">And then one started to hear about fascists right and left. </sentence><sentence id="808">And one started to hear about our neighbors <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> who turned out to be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the other <span class="region">side</span> -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not. </sentence><sentence id="809">Boy, they're lucky. </sentence><sentence id="810">I mean things

that. </sentence><sentence id="812">As far as the <span class="building">school</span> was concermed, I think we could go to <span class="building">school</span> for a little while, but then, again, there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the <span class="building">school</span> and go to a -- a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, and have be separated from the others. </sentence><sentence id="813">And I went to my parents and -- and I said, "I don't want to go to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence

id="816">And I can just see my children coming to me and saying I'm not going to go to this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">You know, I can just see the shock. </sentence><sentence id="818">I -- it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="819">I was really impossible. </sentence><sentence id="820">I got to be very, very rebellious in every way, and I would not go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="821">My sister did. </sentence><sentence id="822">She went to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">And it was very frightening because what the Germans started to do is to isolate the Jews into various groups. </sentence><sentence id="824">I mean they -- at a later date, not right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids in the <span class="building">school</span>, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and that was the end of that you know. </sentence><sentence id="825">Some people were then sent <span class="building">home</span> again if their parents had good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers. </sentence><sentence id="826">But I was -- every time I heard that the <span class="building">school</span> -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch

to that <span class="building">school</span> and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to me, "The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere is not go there." </sentence><sentence id="828">You know, I  1 mean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know, about how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself. </sentence><sentence

dumb. </sentence><sentence id="833">I was plain old dumb. </sentence><sentence id="834">But it was very frightening to have my sister in a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> separated in the

They looked very authentic. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Now mine was of a 22 year old girl. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I was 17 maybe and I looked like 13. </sentence><sentence id="1296"><span class="dlf">Pigtails</span>, little. </sentence><sentence id="1297">So they were unlikely papers. </sentence><sentence id="1298">If anybody really stood there and looked as it said, this girl is 22 years old you know. </sentence><sentence id="1299">So those were my papers. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And I had them. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And then one night -- oh, he also, Monfred also -- then I told Monfred I had the papers and he looked at them and he said, "They're not bad. </sentence><sentence id="1302">They're not bad. </sentence><sentence id="1303">They're very good. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Keep them where you can get to them." </sentence><sentence id="1305">And then we went to another party, and there he had organized that one of the escaped communists from <span class="country">Germany</span> was there and he took off his shirt and it was, you know, he had welts and -- and x-cuts and I mean it was pretty bad to look at it. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And he -- and this guy told us that, you know, that he'd gotten that in one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, you know, and he had -- I think <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1307">He had escaped and he was, he was telling us about the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And he was telling us about the <span class="dlf">salt mines</span> and he was telling us about all sorts of things, you know, that and when we were through with that, Monfred said to me, "Do you believe me now?" </sentence><sentence id="1309">I believed him. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I believed him! </sentence><sentence id="1311">And I came <span class="building">home</span> and I said to my father -- I told my father I had the papers, my false papers and I said to him, "I'm not going. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Whenever they call me, "I said, "I'm not going." </sentence><sentence id="1313">And my father said, "You have to go." </sentence><sentence id="1314">He said, "What will happen to us." </sentence><sentence id="1315">And there came this beautiful guilt was put on me like a hood you know, all over. </sentence><sentence id="1316">If you try to save yourself, that's what it meant, you know, we will all die. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Because in that -- in <span class="populated place">Westerborg</span>, they had various kinds of <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They had <span class="building">barracks</span> for -- the normal <span class="building">barracks</span> for people were picked up normally, and they had <span class="building">barracks</span> that had a big S on it for <span class="populated place">Straasburger</span>, and in those <span class="building">barracks</span> were the people who had been bad, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And that would -- would be them. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And those people would go on <span class="spatial object">transports</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="1321">They would -- in during the selections. </sentence><sentence id="1322"> 7 I think because I know very well that some of them escaped and some of them got out and some survived just as much I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1323">Maybe a less percentage, but just as much as anybody else, which in <span class="country">Holland</span> wasn't good. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So for months, I tried to live with that, you know, and say, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I can't kill my family." </sentence><sentence id="1326">And my father, he felt he had calmed me down. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And then one night we were sitting on our big <span class="dlf">window</span> in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> and we were looking out. </sentence><sentence id="1328">It was -- already it was curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1329">There were curfews at night. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And all of a sudden, we see <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> come out. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Long rows of <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And they're starting at the at the -- at the <span class="building">high rise</span> that you saw in the picture. </sentence><sentence id="1333">On the not on the on where we lived -- and they were coming out. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And I -- I mean I couldn't believe what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1335">They were pick -- going into every -- the way this -- and the <span class="dlf">street</span> is set up that they were -- every <span class="dlf">entrance</span> had steps going up to a platform, and then a wide staircase going up to another platform and on that <span class="dlf">platform</span> were six <span class="spatial object">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1336">I think there were six. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And they would -- at that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1338">They -- they came with lists and they picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked up old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay. </sentence><sentence id="1339">But they picked up his mother. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And she could hardly walk. </sentence><sentence id="1341">She was a very old lady, and I -- my stomach -- they were good friends of ours. </sentence><sentence id="1342">My stomach just turned. </sentence><sentence id="1343">They picked up all the people I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1344">And they stopped about two <span class="dlf">stoops</span> before ours -- two -- you know, two <span class="spatial object">platforms</span> before ours. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And, however, <span class="populated place">Monfred</span> always knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1346">And he knew -- he lived in another part of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1347">And he knew that they were doing our <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And he sent this Leo Vial that I mentioned -- the guy. </sentence><sentence id="1349">He had good false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1350">He was a German civilian -- German soldier of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="1351">He had -- wore a long leather coat and he was on a <span class="spatial object">motor bike</span> and had hood on. </sentence><sentence id="1352">I mean you can imagine he looked like. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And right in the middle of all this going on, the <span class="dlf">door</span> bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought they were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come. </sentence><sentence id="1354">You know, the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> aren't this far away. </sentence><sentence id="1355">They aren't at our <span class="building">house</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="1356">How come? </sentence><sentence id="1357">What's going on?And it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me. </sentence><sentence id="1358">Monfred had sent him to get me. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Right in the middle of all this thing going on. </sentence><sentence id="1360">This curfew and everything! </sentence><sentence id="1361">Right? </sentence><sentence id="1362">So I put my false papers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1363">I took it off. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And I said to my father, "Goodbye." </sentence><sentence id="1365">He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and Leo drove off and told Monfred, "I can't get her. </sentence><sentence id="1366">She -- they won't let her go. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I can't make a fuss. </sentence><sentence id="1368">If I make a fuss, I get arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1369">So I can't, you know, make a fuss." </sentence><sentence id="1370">So he left and I was left there and, of course, that -- as I said, they stopped two <span class="spatial object">platforms</span> before us so nothing happened to us that night. </sentence><sentence id="1371">But that was -- after the next getting together I went to and I talked to all the people there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and everything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, "Hide her if you can." </sentence><sentence id="1372">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Monfred's father had a <span class="building">factory</span> where they made cosmetics, I think, and <span class="spatial object">soap bottles</span> and all this little stuff, and the first night I spent -- I was hidden in the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And it was right close to <span class="populated place">Ann Frank</span> were -- the <span class="building">Ann Frank house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1375">I mean it was on the same kind of a <span class="dlf">canal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I don't know if it was on the Frank's <span class="building">house</span>, but it was on one of the <span class="dlf">canals</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1377">It was the same <span class="building">building</span>, the same situation. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And I stayed there, but they weren't planning for me to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1379">They couldn't have people stay in that <span class="building">house</span>, so some how Monfred had arranged for me to go to a <span class="dlf">paisson</span> where the woman didn't know anything about me. </sentence><sentence id="1380">She got my false papers and she thought I was that person and she registered me with the police under that  8 name and the police didn't you know, they just registered me and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And I lived there and that's where you have the pictures from -- the pictures of Monfred and me. </sentence><sentence id="1382">They were taken in my <span class="interior space">room</span> at that <span class="dlf">paisson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1383">That was -- that was my first underground place. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And I even got mail. </sentence><sentence id="1385">They arranged even for me to get mail so the woman wouldn't get suspicious that I was alone -- a loner and that maybe, you know, there was something wrong with me. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And she got my coupons. </sentence><sentence id="1387">I got food coupons, which Monfred somehow got. </sentence><sentence id="1388">I had everything. </sentence><sentence id="1389">I went to <span class="building">ballet class</span>, a different <span class="building">school</span>, of course, not -- because Alice Kayser had already been picked up, so I went to a different <span class="building">school</span> and I will tell you about that <span class="building">school</span> later, but in any case, I lived a relatively normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I was no more hungry than anybody else and -- and it wasn't so bad then anyway during that early period. </sentence><sentence id="1391">And Monfred and I became very good friends and, you know, I couldn't go to anymore, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1392">I was finished with that part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1393">| was <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1394">My parents were still there. </sentence><sentence id="1395">You know, I forgot -- let's see. </sentence><sentence id="1396">My parents were picked up twice. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And the first time it might have been before I finally left, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Maybe it was. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1400">It might have been before I finally left. </sentence><sentence id="1401">That was when Ike said, "Now you need papers." __ </sentence><sentence id="1402">said -- . </sentence><sentence id="1403">Yes it was before I finally left. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Again, I was sitting -- and was up in the <span class="interior space">attic</span> with a girl from next <span class="dlf">door</span> who was half Jewish, and we heard all that noise. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And there was this during the day and the green police were picking up everybody in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, everybody who was Jewish on that <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And what they hadn't done -- they hadn't stopped the <span class="spatial object">traffic</span> and they hadn't stopped the <span class="spatial object">trollies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1407">They hadn't stopped every -- anything. </sentence><sentence id="1408">It was during the day and everything was going on normally and they were just having themselves a little rautsey_ there. </sentence><sentence id="1409">And I -- the girl next <span class="dlf">door</span> went over the <span class="dlf">roof</span> to her <span class="building">house</span> and I went down and my father wasn't <span class="building">home</span> because it was a working day, you know, and I took off the J and I took my false papers and I went -- no, I didn't have false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1410">I had nothing! </sentence><sentence id="1411">That's right. </sentence><sentence id="1412">I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1413">And I went down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and again with the pig tail, you know, the whole works. </sentence><sentence id="1414">I came on the lower <span class="interior space">platform</span> and two German soldiers jumped up on it. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And I was standing there in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Little German girl in pig tails. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Right? </sentence><sentence id="1418">Little <span class="spatial object">bag</span> that said <span class="building">gym class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And they said to me, "Get the Hell out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1420">We've got work to do" or some kind of thing. __ </sentence><sentence id="1421">That's what they said. ____. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And it -- and I went and then I went on the <span class="spatial object">trolley</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1423">I mean the <span class="spatial object">trolley</span> was running. </sentence><sentence id="1424">I went on the <span class="spatial object">trolley</span> and I went -- I went to -- to <span class="building">Ike mother house</span> -- <span class="building">mother's house</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1430">They had taken them in some <span class="interior space">gym room</span> of a <span class="building">high school</span> where they assembled them. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2310">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2311">I stood in <span class="dlf">line</span> for food. </sentence><sentence id="2312">I also did a few other things. </sentence><sentence id="2313">I was -- as -- as I say, they had to be careful with me because I was pretty stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And I -- they put me to work -- they put me -- I was a dancer. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Right? </sentence><sentence id="2316">And there was a ballet company in <span class="populated place">Amsterdan</span> run by Evan Geeorgi, -- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> or <span class="populated place">Hanover</span> -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans in into the Dutch large <span class="building">state theater</span> to run the <span class="building">ballet company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2317">I went into her <span class="building">ballet school</span> and took classes and I was then asked to join the company. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And I asked if -- the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, "Was it alright?" " </sentence><sentence id="2319">Oh, Yes!" </sentence><sentence id="2320">Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And that way I could help shift people from one hiding place to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were <span class="interior space">underground</span> -- . </sentence><sentence id="2323">And let me tell you how this was  4 done. </sentence><sentence id="2324">There were no more <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, <span class="spatial object">taxis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And there were very few <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, because there was no gasoline for them to use. </sentence><sentence id="2326">So what they had was people on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> pulling, you know, like in <span class="region">third world countries</span>, they would pull little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> behind them. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Some of them were covered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in <span class="country">Holland</span>, you know, people wouldn't get wet. </sentence><sentence id="2328">And others were open. </sentence><sentence id="2329">All sorts of various ways of transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2330">And the few people that I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew. </sentence><sentence id="2331">With them being the <span class="spatial object">bench</span> and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on top on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with make-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police stuck their head in there and saying, "What is this?" </sentence><sentence id="2332">you know. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Curfew is on -- you could -- I would have a smile and papers. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And I shifted a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="2335">That way! </sentence><sentence id="2336">You know, from one <span class="region">hiding place</span> that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And I did little things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2338">Also, Monfred would distribute the ____ which was the <span class="building">communist newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2339">Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other <span class="building">newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2340">And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots on top. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, "You bring this to a certain little <span class="dlf">portal</span> with and just somebody will come and get it." </sentence><sentence id="2342">I didn't know who was going to get it. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I didn't know when they were there. </sentence><sentence id="2344">If they were there before me or after me. </sentence><sentence id="2345">I -- you know, I would go. </sentence><sentence id="2346">I would watch the <span class="dlf">portal</span> and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and not ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right people, I would walk up with the bag. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And if they took it, they were the right people. </sentence><sentence id="2348">If they didn't, I would walk on. </sentence><sentence id="2349">Little things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly short of money of course. </sentence><sentence id="2351">That was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="2352">And Monfred in his letter to me just now said that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry that was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell. </sentence><sentence id="2353">It was sold to Dutch people who, you know, wanted it as an investment. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And the money was used for us to eat and -- and live, rent and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="2355">Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2356">We tried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to <span class="country">Germany</span> to work in those <span class="building">factories</span>, not particularly in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, just in <span class="building">factories</span> while their own people went to the various <span class="dlf">fronts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2357">And we would mix-up these. </sentence><sentence id="2358">We would have Frenchmen in <span class="country">Holland</span>, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the French would say, "We were sent here to work in -- in <span class="country">Holland</span> and for the Dutch -- for the German industry," And the Dutchman in <span class="country">France</span> would say, "But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the <span class="building">French industry</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2359">I mean it was a total mix-up. </sentence><sentence id="2360">Some people also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Spain</span> into <span class="country">Portugal</span> and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the <span class="building">British 8th Brigade</span> in <span class="country">England</span> if one would be able to get there. </sentence><sentence id="2361">But our Leo only took them to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Well, on his way <span class="building">home</span> he would often bring <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> full of lipsticks and , you know, all these wonderful French things that you couldn't get. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And perfumes and other things that the French and that <span class="country">Holland</span> didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And then me, I would be sent to sell them. </sentence><sentence id="2365">And I would go to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them <span class="populated place">downtown</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And people would buy them like crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2367">I mean I didn't -- I sold them wholesale. </sentence><sentence id="2368">I sold the whole <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> full all at once, and we would eat. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And one time I came <span class="building">home</span> and I saw the Dutch police all over the place, watching -- in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Well, I knew enough,  5 Thank God, not to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2371">So I stood on the <span class="dlf">corner</span> watching til they came back out and -- and they had made a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Of course, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2373">I don't know what Monfred did, but he got rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="2374">And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments, you know, where you think, "Now, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="2375">This is it." </sentence><sentence id="2376">And also one time I drove -- rode my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> up a <span class="dlf">one-way street</span> the wrong way. </sentence><sentence id="2377">I..I was really confused. </sentence><sentence id="2378">It was <span class="populated place">downtown</span> and there was a lot of traffic. </sentence><sentence id="2379">And I got stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2380">And, of course, they looked at my papers. </sentence><sentence id="2381">By that time, I had much better papers. </sentence><sentence id="2382">Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told Evan that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but she knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="2384">Never! </sentence><sentence id="2385">She called -- did call me in and she said, "It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on further trips." </sentence><sentence id="2386">She put that very well. </sentence><sentence id="2387">She never said, you know, "I put you into this <span class="building">company</span> because you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?" </sentence><sentence id="2388">She said exactly what I told you. </sentence><sentence id="2389">She said, "A little more training would be good for you, so just go to <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2390">So that she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered. </sentence><sentence id="2391">And the strange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me. </sentence><sentence id="2392">Was a different group of people. </sentence><sentence id="2393">It was Maria Austria and her friend, , who are all in the book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't want me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And I wouldn't listen. </sentence><sentence id="2395">And so that's how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="2396">They went and they told Yvonne Geoorgi_ about that. </sentence><sentence id="2397">So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorgi which she had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left. </sentence><sentence id="2398">I never did believe that was really a fascist. </sentence><sentence id="2399">She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as much character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2400">I -- who's going to throw the first stone. </sentence><sentence id="2401">She didn't kill me. </sentence><sentence id="2402">She was good to me. </sentence><sentence id="2403">Really. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's the big festival after we were liberated -- liberated? </sentence><sentence id="2405">I was not allowed to march because I had worked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever said: But she did it because of the papers. </sentence><sentence id="2406">The <span class="interior space">underground</span> didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2407">Monfred didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2408">Nobody -- I mean, <span class="populated place">Monfred</span> probably didn't think it was very important. </sentence><sentence id="2409">I thought it was terrible! </sentence><sentence id="2410">I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this is after war stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2411">That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was -- was, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2622">So anyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course, the Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know, from -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> would come flying. </sentence><sentence id="2623">They were full of bombs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And on the way <span class="building">home</span>, he might have a bomb left. </sentence><sentence id="2625">And they would drop a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2626">They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="2627">So sometimes the Germans got one of those <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, and we got somebody to hide -- English, American, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2628">New Year's Eve, the American went on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and shot off his gun. </sentence><sentence id="2629">I mean I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2630">Ohhhh! </sentence><sentence id="2631">So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got to the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And they let the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> drop food in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> -- in and around <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> -- we had flat <span class="dlf">roofs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2634">You know, the <span class="dlf">roofs</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> behind the decorations are flat. </sentence><sentence id="2635">So they dropped cases of food on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span> or in the <span class="dlf">parks</span> or in <span class="interior space">open space</span>, and the Germans were so scared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and -- I -- the food was distributed evenly, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2637">You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your <span class="dlf">roof</span>, you know, you better take it. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And we were all starving. </sentence><sentence id="2639">We were really -- the bread was  8 -- had gone sour. </sentence><sentence id="2640">We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And then the -- we heard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us. </sentence><sentence id="2642">I haven't told you about <span class="populated place">Akmier</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2762">Q: I'd like you to go back and tell us about <span class="populated place">Akmier</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2764">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2765">Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the <span class="spatial object">Dutch underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And Monfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should, perhaps, if it was alright -- it was my <span class="interior space">apartment</span> -- right? -- </sentence><sentence id="2767"><span class="building">Akmier</span> should come to us. </sentence><sentence id="2768">Well, <span class="populated place">Akmier</span> came to visit -- to see if that was alright. </sentence><sentence id="2769">Well we also arranged a girl for him to come that he might like. </sentence><sentence id="2770">We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him. </sentence><sentence id="2771">We didn't want him to get into trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2772">Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to stay where he was he felt for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And the <span class="interior space">underground</span> came to him to <span class="populated place">Monfred</span> and said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is where he is now, we might have to send him back to <span class="country">Germany</span> or anyway he'll be in deep trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2774">And so they sent me to get him. </sentence><sentence id="2775">And I went over there I said you have to come and stay us and you have to come. </sentence><sentence id="2776">You have to come. </sentence><sentence id="2777">So <span class="populated place">Akmier</span> came. </sentence><sentence id="2778">And then I heard his whole story. </sentence><sentence id="2779">He -- he was a German -- was involved in a <span class="populated place">Munich</span> story where the six people were hanged. </sentence><sentence id="2780">Six students -- they turned over a whole <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> full of pamphlets on -- on an assembly in -- of <span class="building">Munich University</span> full of anti-Hitler propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="2781">And in one -- of course, they all got caught. </sentence><sentence id="2782">I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2783">So -- so in one of their books was his name? -- </sentence><sentence id="2784">in one of his -- the <span class="spatial object">notebooks</span>, <span class="spatial object">address books</span> was his name, and somehow they managed to get him out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2785">He had just finished his medical studies and he was sent to <span class="building">Villemina Hot Towers</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, which is a <span class="building">mental institution</span> and <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry. </sentence><sentence id="2786">He wanted to go into psychiatry. </sentence><sentence id="2787">So he studied there and worked there, and he started working with the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2788">And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2789">He got us a piece of soap once in awhile. </sentence><sentence id="2790">He he helped people. </sentence><sentence id="2791">He moved people from one place to -- he did a whole lot probably that I don't even know about. </sentence><sentence id="2792">And then the Germans shifted him to <span class="country">France</span> because there were big battles going on in <span class="country">France</span>, and they needed psychiatrists -- some people to help. </sentence><sentence id="2793">And in <span class="country">France</span> and once -- once he got there, the situation was so disastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers it was worthwhile fighting for <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2794">It was worthwhile fighting. </sentence><sentence id="2795">And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic. </sentence><sentence id="2796">It was ridiculous to fight. </sentence><sentence id="2797">And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for him -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you know. </sentence><sentence id="2798">And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely lost his mind. </sentence><sentence id="2799">He just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2800">That was not his nature. </sentence><sentence id="2801">He couldn't stand -- stand it. </sentence><sentence id="2802">And so toward V-J day, he had a little <span class="spatial object">Fiat</span> -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one person like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode. </sentence><sentence id="2803">He got to <span class="country">Belgium</span> and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on -- on all the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> that went through. </sentence><sentence id="2804">So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you know, why should I have a mark like that on my <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2805">And he went to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> and he washed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole  9 lot of <span class="spatial object">cars</span> with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> being shot, one after the other. </sentence><sentence id="2806">Deserters. </sentence><sentence id="2807">Shooting the deserters! </sentence><sentence id="2808">He didn't have a zero on his <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and he made to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And in <span class="country">Holland</span>, he called the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and the <span class="interior space">underground</span> -- the <span class="spatial object">car</span> had broken down so he had to walk a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2810">And in <span class="country">Holland</span> the -- the underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and took him to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and hid him. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much then because he could -- what could he do, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2812">He was, himself, endangered. </sentence><sentence id="2813">And -- and then after the wa, Akmier stayed in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2814">He got this -- you know, the Queen said he was a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous. </sentence><sentence id="2815">But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know. </sentence><sentence id="2816">He didn't -- he worked as a psychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share. </sentence><sentence id="2817">He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know, "Don't you share with others? </sentence><sentence id="2818">Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?" " </sentence><sentence id="2819">Uh- huh." </sentence><sentence id="2820">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2821">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2822">Just sit. </sentence><sentence id="2823">And </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2886">A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the <span class="country">States</span> anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2887">No, I -- I wanted children and <span class="populated place">Akmier</span> did not want children. </sentence><sentence id="2888">He said, "This is not a world" -- this is one of the things that was done to him. </sentence><sentence id="2889">I mean, what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="2890">He couldn't get passed it, shall we say. </sentence><sentence id="2891">He said this is not a world for -- for any children. </sentence><sentence id="2892">And he ended up marrying a woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2893">I mean he really looked for somebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood disease that she couldn't have any more children then. </sentence><sentence id="2894">He -- he -- it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2895">It really was so sad. </sentence><sentence id="2896">And he -- he had such talent. </sentence><sentence id="2897">You know, he played the violin, and he was very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="2898">His father was an incredible person. </sentence><sentence id="2899">His father -- there were three sons. </sentence><sentence id="2900">Now let me just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans. ____ </sentence><sentence id="2901">His father was the headmaster of a <span class="building">school</span> and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father called his three sons and he said, "There's only one God." </sentence><sentence id="2902">They were all Catholic.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2956">Q: Tell us -- tell us about the day of liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2958">A: Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the  0 last. </sentence><sentence id="2959">You might have already have heard about that where the <span class="interior space">underground</span> had been able to absolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so frustrated. </sentence><sentence id="2960">I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you know, or -- or blow up some <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2961">I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2962">But they had all these weapons. </sentence><sentence id="2963">And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and they really wanted that. </sentence><sentence id="2964">And in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were coming and -- and everybody went downtown to the <span class="building">Dom</span>, which is the big place in front of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2965">And on the <span class="dlf">Dam</span> also was the <span class="building">German officer's Club</span>, right -- I mean the <span class="building">Palace of the Queen</span> is, shall we say, to the north and <span class="building">officer's club</span> just a little <span class="dlf">street</span> apart, maybe 10 feet, 12 feet. </sentence><sentence id="2966">There was the <span

</sentence><sentence id="2969">I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody had a big shotgun in -- in the <span class="building">Palace</span> -- the <span class="interior space">underground</span> had a big shotgun and shot into the <span class="building">club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2970">And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many people standing right there in the <span class="building">Dom</span>, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many Germans died. </sentence><sentence id="2971">I mean it was totally useless. </sentence><sentence id="2972">It was one of those things that happened in total confusion and fear on both sides, fear and loathing on both sides, and just a horrible, stupid, awful thing. </sentence><sentence id="2973">Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready. </sentence><sentence id="2974">You knew you could already go on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2975">You knew you didn't have to be as afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And they were coming. </sentence><sentence id="2977">And they did come. </sentence><sentence id="2978">They came. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And I remember looking at the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> coming and full of these healthy pink and blond

</sentence><sentence id="2982">I mean it was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="2983">And, of course, we went out there and screamed. </sentence><sentence id="2984">We just screamed. </sentence><sentence id="2985">And all my dance buddies, you know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends. </sentence><sentence id="2986">They all got boyfriends, and this and that. </sentence><sentence id="2987">I, of course, had a friend and I did not. </sentence><sentence id="2988">I had always been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any kind of soldier. </sentence><sentence id="2989">Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person. </sentence><sentence id="2990">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="2991">It was -- I mean it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2992">It was heavenly, and it was scary. </sentence><sentence id="2993">Very, very scary! </sentence><sentence id="2994">Because I didn't really know where I belonged then, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2995">I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn because I got into the <span class="building">ballet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2996">The ballet 1945 was started right then. </sentence><sentence id="2997">It had already been started for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet. </sentence><sentence id="2998">But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the <span class="building">Ballet</span> 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2999">Then later we came to the <span class="country">States</span>, <span class="building">Ballet Company</span>, grew out of that. </sentence><sentence id="3000">And then they had a festival, a wonderful festival. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And, of course, there were no lights. </sentence><sentence id="3002">There was not yet any electricity. </sentence><sentence id="3003">By that time we had to go down and get water to the <span class="interior space">third floor</span> in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water in buckets and we were pretty starved. </sentence><sentence id="3004">I mean during that we ate from the <span class="interior space">fox kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3005">We ate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> came up with, that's what we ate. </sentence><sentence id="3006">You know, you had three little <span class="spatial object">pots</span> and one of you had to go and get it. </sentence><sentence id="3007">And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained much more than the people who formerly had money. </sentence><sentence id="3008">It was very, very funny. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And the articles in the paper were a riot. </sentence><sentence id="3010">But hunger was not funny. </sentence><sentence id="3011">And we would go up and get up in the morning and have -- have a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>'s cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things, and we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death. </sentence><sentence id="3012">I was always cold. </sentence><sentence id="3013">I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear. </sentence><sentence id="3014">I can stand hunger better  1 than cold. </sentence><sentence id="3015">It was terribly cold. </sentence><sentence id="3016">We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> -- we would go all in one <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and put everybody's blankets and <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> on top of us and we still were cold, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3017">And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only cold water to wash with. </sentence><sentence id="3018">And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat -- heat the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, which by the way was the only thing to cook on. </sentence><sentence id="3019">Remember gas wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3020">So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from outside and -- and we brought -- we had a whole <span class="interior space">room</span>, small <span class="interior space">room</span>, <span class="interior space">storage room</span> full of peat. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And we used the <span class="env feature">peat</span> to -- to cook on the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> which was just a little heating, which also heated the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And that <span class="env feature">peat</span> was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger. </sentence><sentence id="3023">And one night I caught 84 fleas. </sentence><sentence id="3024">I killed 84 fleas. </sentence><sentence id="3025">1 mean we were covered, and actually we didn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then. </sentence><sentence id="3026">I mean I don't think there even. </sentence><sentence id="3027">I mean it was just in total disaster. </sentence><sentence id="3028">We were hungry, cold, and full of fleas by the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3029">It was outrageous. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And then there was this wonderful festival where they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at night we had lights and <span class="spatial object">boats</span> were laid across the <span class="dlf">canals</span> and you could walk from one side from one __ to the other just over -- over the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3031">I was in love. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3033">It was the most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember. </sentence><sentence id="3034">And I didn't think -- I didn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And then afterwards, I said, "Now what? </sentence><sentence id="3036">Now what?" </sentence><sentence id="3037">And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists. </sentence><sentence id="3038">They are lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists. </sentence><sentence id="3039">Well, Monfred said to me then, "Don't believe it." </sentence><sentence id="3040">And I -- I already hated him with a passion. </sentence><sentence id="3041">Right? </sentence><sentence id="3042">Because he had done all these horrible things. </sentence><sentence id="3043">And he said, "Don't believe it." </sentence><sentence id="3044">And I said, "I'm going to believe it." </sentence><sentence id="3045">We then knew -- we knew about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3046">In "45.So I started going to the <span class="building">train stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3047">And, of course, I stood there. </sentence><sentence id="3048">When I had the time, I stood there and I stood there and I stood there. </sentence><sentence id="3049">I asked -- and when I see these films, you know, they are films made by the French. </sentence><sentence id="3050">They were wonderful French films, but and -- and they're these people going to -- other people coming out of <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, you know, and they have their shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from <span class="populated place">camps</span> and you ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so? </sentence><sentence id="3051">Did you know so and son? </sentence><sentence id="3052">No. </sentence><sentence id="3053">No. </sentence><sentence id="3054">No. </sentence><sentence id="3055">Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's name to get back to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3056">I'm sure of it. </sentence><sentence id="3057">And recently somebody showed up with my sister's name. </sentence><sentence id="3058">And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone. </sentence><sentence id="3059">I mean there was nobody to find. </sentence><sentence id="3060">And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people. </sentence><sentence id="3061">I had girlfriends who met Americans and who married them. </sentence><sentence id="3062">And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war. </sentence><sentence id="3063">And I was waving goodbye to them because they were marrying American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3064">What do the American soldiers know?They know nothing! </sentence><sentence id="3065">And if they had known, what would it have mattered? </sentence><sentence id="3066">They were in love. </sentence><sentence id="3067">You know, such is human nature. </sentence></p></dialogue>
