<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: So, when the war started, you -- you were on the <span class="region">Soviet side</span>, or you were on the <span class="region">Polish side</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="67"> take him to <span class="country">Russia</span>, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="68">And we thought that maybe ca -- jer -- he thought that maybe ki-- when the Germans came in, they didn't -- they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="70">And after awhile, which I don't really remember how long, they formed a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and everybody from all the <span class="populated place">villages</span> and different <span class="populated place">neighborhoods</span> -- our <span class="building">house</span> was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="72">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don't know how long it took after the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was forming, but on our <span class="dlf">doorstep</span> there would be dead people that have -- from hunger, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="73">And they were looking in <span class="spatial object">garbage cans</span> for potato peels or onion peels. </sentence><sentence id="74">And we basically, since we were in our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, I imagine my -- my parents may have stored some food, so I don't remember being hungry at that point. </sentence><sentence id="75">Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti -- akejas they call it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="76">The first one we -- we had relatives outside of <span class="populated place">town</span>, they -- we went there, to outside of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">My father, I think, remained in <span class="populated place">town</span>, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father's father was killed, right across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">He was shot right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he -- they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="81">And after a day or two, he will come and get us. </sentence><sentence id="82">And it took about a week and he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="83">It is not the primary

their -- wherever they hid us, in their <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And they were shotti -- shooting after us, you know, when we -- they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="89">And we went back to our <span class="building">home</span>, but eventually this <span class="building">akeja</span> must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our <span class="building">house</span> and they chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="90">Out of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab -- she had a -- her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it -- to take that. </sentence><sentence id="92">As a child I was able to sneak by with that. </sentence><sentence id="93">And this is basically -- that eventually saved our life. </sentence><sentence id="94">And then they made <span class="populated place">Judenfrei</span>, our <span class="populated place">town</span> was <span class="populated place">Judenfrei</span>, but my grandmother on my father's side had survived, and then an aunt, my father's sister. </sentence><sentence id="95">And we went into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and we --I guess my mother must have known that across this <span class="env feature">river</span>, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="96">And you -- you were able to get there. </sentence><sentence id="97">So we were in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> right acro -- from the <span class="env feature">river</span>, and hiding in there, and a young student came across. </sentence><sentence id="98">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the <span class="env feature">water</span> gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and -- and take you across. </sentence><sentence id="99">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had -- whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we came to a little <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Potok Zloty</span>, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there. </sentence><sentence id="102">And we went on to <span class="populated place">Buczacz</span>, and in <span class="populated place">Buczacz</span> we lived with a family that was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="103">And there were also many This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="104">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

id="107"> <span class="building">akejas</span> and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. </sentence><sentence id="109">And right after the <span class="spatial object">akeja</span> I'd come out and they'd say, the children are dead, they're -- they're gone. </sentence><sentence id="110">Or -- and one day I came out and I saw a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> full of dead children, with bleed -- blood coming out of the -- the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">You know, when -- so I was always ready, I was afraid I'd be left behind, being the -- the youngest one. </sentence><sentence id="112">So as soon as they -- I'd be -- at night or whatever, I'd be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="113">And basically after this -- you know, after -- I'm--I'm not sure of how much time passed, they made that <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Judenfrei</span>, and my -- and we had an-another little <span class="populated place">town</span>, my ki -- father's relatives, cousins were there, and they -- I don't how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there. </sentence><sentence id="114">And we went to <span class="populated place">Kopyezynce</span> was that name. </sentence><sentence id="115">And we went in -- we stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="116">And of course then it started over there; the -- the killings started over there. </sentence><sentence id="117">And my f--- relatives" son, they -- he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> from that <span class="building">house</span> that we lived in to under the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> it was camouflaged, in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, and we were there. </sentence><sentence id="118">There were a couple of <span class="spatial object">akejas</span> there, but this was like the last one. </sentence><sentence id="119">We we -- all went into this <span class="building">bunker</span>, we were 30 some odd people that went in there. </sentence><sentence id="120">And they must -- they built a air -- you know, some type of air, to give us air in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we -- that there was a -- that we -- there was a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> under there, so they started digging from

class="building">house</span>, you know, that we -- how we got in there. </sentence><sentence id="127">So they discovered us on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="128">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">And basically, I don't know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="130">A -- but I was holding onto my brother. </sentence><sentence id="131">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us. </sentence><sentence id="132">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there. </sentence><sentence id="133">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr -- they thought that he was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="134">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. </sentence><sentence id="135">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="136">And then we -- we -- when -- after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people. </sentence><sentence id="137">At night we snuck out of there, went into a -- into another <span class="building">building</span>, out onto a <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">We stayed there for a long time without any food. </sentence><sentence id="139">Being the
