<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: <span class="populated place">Teplice</span> was a very good <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">I mean, I grew up there; went to <span class="building">elementary school</span>, went to <span class="building">high school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="33">And what's amazing about it is, | never encountered anti...antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="34">I mean, I never knew, even... Matter of fact, I never even knew I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="35">Because I didn't know Judaism is a connotation with a religion, or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="36">So I was Jew by religion, but it was not part of my personality. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I must have been, maybe, 11 or 12 years old and my best friend ...

Sagal. </sentence><sentence id="84">I made two movies with him...with him; and a actress at that time which was very, very popular in Europe--[Barsa Nirosi (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="85">By the way, the reason also I got the job is because I was at that time bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="86">So the movies, at that time, were made in Hungarian and in German. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I could speak both languages. </sentence><sentence id="88">So when we took one take, I didn't have to  change roles. </sentence><sentence id="89">I could stay in the same role for the German take and for the Hungarian take. </sentence><sentence id="90">And...and plus we played with Hans Virbis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="91">He's supposed to make a picture with Martha Eggar, except at that time she fell in love with Jan Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="92">And she came to <span class="country">America</span>, and she left the Jan Kippur in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And...and this was my youth, "til my parents came...also came to <span class="country">Hungary</span>; and it was getting... because <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> became very unpleasant at that time. </sentence><sentence id="94">And...uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: What was happening to your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Uh...My parents came and tried to settle in..in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">They felt this maybe in Hungarian, because at that time <span class="populated place">Horthy</span> was more fascistic. </sentence><sentence id="123">So they felt that maybe Hitler's gonna spare <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And plus, my father had a older brother living in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And he couldn't get any...in that between <span class="country">Hungary</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, it was not very pleasant circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were already talking about war rumbling. </sentence><sentence id="127">So...uh...it was very rough, and my father couldn't get the papers to, uh...couldn't get papers to become a citizen or...or allowed to be stayed...allowed to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, through some acquaintances, my mother knew Mr. Beck. </sentence><sentence id="129">I think...I think Beck was at that time Foreign Minister of <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">| And she went to his <span class="building">office</span>, and she bribed him quite--I don't know, let's call it bribe--when she gave him a tremendous amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="131">At that time, this was a big money for us; because it's all what my parents almost had. </sentence><sentence id="132">And after this, she gets an invitation and my father gets an invitation to a dinner which is in honor of Mr. Beck. </sentence><sentence id="133">So they were very elated, because they thought this gonna be the chance that he'd finally...he'd gonna give a...the papers which they needed to stay in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">So during the conversation... During this dinner, he knocked on the <span class="spatial object">glass</span>; and he says, "I have another question to ask. </sentence><sentence id="135">I want to ask Mr. Helmer how come he gave me this tremendous amount of money." </sentence><sentence id="136">So it's a good thing that my father said, "I'm giving it to the <span class="building">Hungarian Red Cross</span>." </sentence><sentence id="137">And with this sentence, he lost all his money. </sentence><sentence id="138">Because Mr. Beck didn't take the money. </sentence><sentence id="139">The <span class="building">Hungarian Red Cross</span> got the money. </sentence><sentence id="140">And my parents were deported. </sentence><sentence id="141">And it was my parents, my brother and my sister; and they were deported to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because they had a chance to go to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">You had a chance to go to any <span class="dlf">border</span> they choose; and they choose <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">And shortly after this, I was deported also. </sentence><sentence id="145">Matter of fact, I shall never forget; I came <span class="building">home</span> from a movie which I saw--Modern Times, with Charlie Chaplin. </sentence><sentence id="146">This was the movie I saw. </sentence><sentence id="147">And I came <span class="building">home</span>; and they woke me up during the night and arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="148">And they deported me to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I wound up in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of _6d_. </sentence><sentence id="150">Always almost exactly the Friday before the war. </sentence><sentence id="151">And before the war. </sentence><sentence id="152">So we stayed in somebody's <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">I don't know who it was, where it was <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">By that time, the German war started. </sentence><sentence id="155">I think it's October Ist, 1939." </sentence><sentence id="156">The occupation was immediate. </sentence><sentence id="157">We couldn't escape anyplace, anyways. </sentence><sentence id="158">And, uh...because of financial difficulties, at that time was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="159">So...because a lot of people escaped. </sentence><sentence id="160">So we found a place in _6d_ on...in a <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">Matter of fact, it was...the <span class="interior space">attic</span> was so low that I don't think we ever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
