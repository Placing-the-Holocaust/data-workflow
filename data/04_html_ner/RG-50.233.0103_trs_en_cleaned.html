<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems. </sentence><sentence id="124">I hate to say that. </sentence><sentence id="125">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on. </sentence><sentence id="126">She was in a way, she was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="127">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn't make it easiest in life, and she suffered. </sentence><sentence id="128">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date. </sentence><sentence id="129">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn't have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that. </sentence><sentence id="130">They fortunately I would say, had no children. </sentence><sentence id="131">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">Both he and she were good speakers. </sentence><sentence id="133">They taught Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="134">Her Hebrew was much better than mine. </sentence><sentence id="135">They were planning to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">I don't recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in <span class="country">Holland</span> and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war. </sentence><sentence id="137">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> until July "deg43. </sentence><sentence id="138">They were sent in the same <span class="spatial object">transport</span> as I to <span class="populated place">Westerbork</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">They also were put on the <span class="country">Palestine</span> list. </sentence><sentence id="140">With the <span class="country">Palestine</span> list they came to <span class="populated place">Bergen Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the <span class="spatial object">Palestine transport</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: That was in July 1944. </sentence><sentence id="164">She has a terrible time in <span class="populated place">Bergen Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in <span class="populated place">Bergen Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">We didn't see each other too much because I worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same <span class="spatial object">train</span> in those <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> in April 11, 1945 leaving <span class="populated place">Bergen Belsen</span> and going to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">She was liberated together with me in <span class="populated place">Trovitz</span>, near <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span> and must have died two days after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="169">I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn't tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170"> Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child? </sentence><sentence id="171">Did she play any <span class="spatial object">instruments</span>? </sentence><sentence id="172">Did you have any pets in the family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: We never had. </sentence><sentence id="174">Yes, we must have had cats somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="175">I remember something about cats. </sentence><sentence id="176">But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don't recall at all that we had pets. </sentence><sentence id="177">We all played an <span class="spatial object">instrument</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">One of the things I do recall is notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="179">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="180"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="181">I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste. </sentence><sentence id="182">But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument. </sentence><sentence id="183">I don't remember what my sisters learned, but I'm sure they did too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: She was friendly, she had a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="199">Her friends circled around the same friends we had. </sentence><sentence id="200">Mostly of the Zionist groups. </sentence><sentence id="201">I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get. </sentence><sentence id="202">Maybe at that time already I felt more I was a member of the <span class="building">basketball club</span>, which had about twenty percent Jews. </sentence><sentence id="203">Or eighty percent non-Jews then. </sentence><sentence id="204">Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent. </sentence><sentence id="205">Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don't think she went out to the <span class="region">non-Jewish world</span> as much as I did. </sentence><sentence id="206">Of course having worked at the <span class="building">Carlton Hotel</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, it made me also better understand the importance of the <span class="region">non-Jewish world</span> to the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="207">But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life. </sentence><sentence id="208">That was ninety percent of her life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="223">The only thing I can say is that I do recall that in March 1945, she was very hungry and I had a little piece of bread and she asked me for that piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="224">I never gave it to her. </sentence><sentence id="225">Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tremendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life. </sentence><sentence id="226">I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn't give it to my sister. </sentence><sentence id="227">But I still think about it. </sentence><sentence id="228">It wouldn't have saved her life anyway, but things like that, you know, stay for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="229">That was about the last time I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="230">One of the horrors of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
