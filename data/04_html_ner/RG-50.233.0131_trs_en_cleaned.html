<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="851">A: We heard rumors that when they had to leave, they liquidate the <span class="populated place">camps</span> with the people. </sentence><sentence

anything good, so I said I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="857">She didn't ask me anymore. </sentence><sentence id="858">At one time all of a sudden it was at night, they shut off the lights, we were in the <span class="building">factory</span>, we were working the night shift. </sentence><sentence id="859">It was sometime in <span class="dlf">deg44</span>, the end of 44. </sentence><sentence id="860">What's that? </sentence><sentence id="861">I said, I don't know, I couldn't find anything, I couldn't find any excuse. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="862">Naturally, we thought for the

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="864">My wife asked me that time, what's that? </sentence><sentence id="865">This was when it went through the minds, this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="866">I

</sentence><sentence id="877">Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. </sentence><sentence id="878">The end of "44 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="879">There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">We had there a German boss which it didn't bother him. </sentence><sentence id="881">He said you don't bother me, I don't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="882">I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="883">He was foolish, but it didn't bother him any, didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="884">Then they took him away and came in another one. </sentence><sentence id="885">They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy . </sentence><sentence id="886">He was crazy, foolish. </sentence><sentence id="887">You couldn't talk to him anything, couldn't talk to him, there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="888">So the boys said let's try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="889">So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. </sentence><sentence id="890">Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, sometimes a <span class="spatial object">shell</span> we would find on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, or whatever it was he hit her. </sentence><sentence id="891">He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. </sentence><sentence id="892">And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. </sentence><sentence id="893">One time I passed by she said was it night? </sentence><sentence id="894">She was crying, I said what's the matter she said I don't know, everything was going perfect. </sentence><sentence id="895">He hit me with a screwdriver. </sentence><sentence id="896">So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you're trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. </sentence><sentence id="897">Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="898">Which it meant if we won't be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="899">As weak as I was I said no, not enough. </sentence><sentence id="900">I don't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="901">And I find in between two <span class="spatial object">machines</span>, he was a short fellow, he wasn't taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him. </sentence><sentence id="902">I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="903">If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I'll be able to take a beating, but don't hit her. </sentence><sentence id="904">And he started beating me up. </sentence><sentence id="905">While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don't hit my wife. </sentence><sentence id="906">It's unbelievable because he didn't have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place. </sentence><sentence id="907">But apparently, he didn't do it and since then he didn't touch her again. </sentence><sentence id="908">This was before Christmas time "44, about three, four weeks before. </sentence><sentence id="909">Then the 15" of January in the morning, they didn't took us out from the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="910">We remained in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="911">Like normally, we used to go out to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="912">A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before. </sentence><sentence id="913">At that time it looked, it didn't look good. </sentence><sentence id="914">At one time before, like I said I had my sister in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, <span class="country">America</span>, <span class="building">home</span> I never used to write the letters to her. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="915">But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5", <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, <span class="region">Pa.</span>, <span class="country">USA</span>. </sentence><sentence id="916">At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address. </sentence><sentence id="917">I used to say it in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="918">I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this. </sentence><sentence id="919">When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister's address. </sentence><sentence id="920">If we'll survive there we're going to meet. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="921">This happened the 15" of January, the 15". </sentence><sentence id="922">So in the morning we didn't go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before. </sentence><sentence id="923">Later on around 9 o'clock or so, 10 o'clock, we had to go out to the <span class="spatial object">appel</span> and stand up in the <span class="dlf">line</span> and the bosses came around to take us to work. </sentence><sentence id="924">We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man. </sentence><sentence id="925">Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman. </sentence><sentence id="926">Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in German, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you clothes. </sentence><sentence id="927">To take in the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="928">Like he knew  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="929"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection other one, higher than him, and I told him my wife they're going to take out, do something. </sentence><sentence id="930">He said I'm powerless, there's nothing I can do. </sentence><sentence id="931">There was, the main engineer from the whole <span class="building">factory</span> there, the <span class="building">ammunitions factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">So the main engineer from the whole <span class="building">factory</span>, in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look. </sentence><sentence id="933">Terrible, terrible man. </sentence><sentence id="934">At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him. </sentence><sentence id="935">Why, it was plain and simple. </sentence><sentence id="936">They were trying to take out the people and people were running back. </sentence><sentence id="937">Nobody wants to go away. </sentence><sentence id="938">Everybody wants to stay in the place and they were taking them out and they were running back. </sentence><sentence id="939">So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could. </sentence><sentence id="940">And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as it may sound, how I did it, I don't know, but I did something. </sentence><sentence id="941">I went over to him and I said, engineer, I'm here from the first moment when the place started, now they're going to send out my wife. </sentence><sentence id="942">If they're going to send her out, I'm going to go with. </sentence><sentence id="943">I scared him off. </sentence><sentence id="944">So he said, where is the boss? </sentence><sentence id="945">He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too. </sentence><sentence id="946">He said do you know her?. </sentence><sentence id="947">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="948">Is she a good worker, he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="949">He said remain here. </sentence><sentence id="950">Another boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained. </sentence><sentence id="951">How I did it, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="952">But it was a rumor just imagination it was, supposedly you're supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here. </sentence><sentence id="953">So somehow I did it and that's how we remained together. </sentence><sentence id="954">Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="955">So I said if we'll survive, there is going to be a place where we met. </sentence><sentence id="956">O.K. Then we are still in the <span class="building">factory</span>, we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> to bring in the lunch for the group. </sentence><sentence id="957">Then we got a lunch and I sat down on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> near the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="958">So I didn't pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn't pay attention yet, but then it didn't took long another few minutes we heard more banging. </sentence><sentence id="959">So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, I said now I'll put away the food what I had, let's pay attention what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="960">So after awhile we saw the Germans through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, we could see that they start running. </sentence><sentence id="961">Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what's going on with you don't you see what's doing outside already? </sentence><sentence id="962">Stop the work. </sentence><sentence id="963">So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="964">There was a <span class="building">factory</span> , a <span class="building">munitions factory</span>, a bigger one than ours. </sentence><sentence id="965">When the Russians came close to that they  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="966">A: Around 10 o0'clock, at first we were in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, then we started to move out to go out from the <span class="building">barracks</span>, after that incident at the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, the push back was like I said before and so we start to spread and we were in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, we were outside, because we heard the shooting and wondered what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="967">Around 10 o'clock the <span class="spatial object">fire engines</span>, the fire people from the fire engine company they came around and told us now you are free, just watch out from <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> from the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="968">It was only a wild dream to be able, I don't know whether I even identify, but subconsciously there was some kind of hope in the back of the conscience that maybe, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="969">This was the moment what we heard, now you are free just watch out from the top. </sentence><sentence id="970">So I still had my <span class="spatial object">can</span> with my lunch and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="971">So some people did smart things. </sentence><sentence id="972">They were going around in the <span class="building">German homes</span> and did whatever they could do, take whatever they could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
