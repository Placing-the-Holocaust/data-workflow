<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell us about your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My parents had a checkered career. </sentence><sentence id="12">They were both immigrants, they arrived from different <span class="populated place">communities</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> in approximately 1907. </sentence><sentence id="13">My father was married at the time he arrived. </sentence><sentence id="14">And he and my mother met and they fell in love. </sentence><sentence id="15">And eventually they were married. </sentence><sentence id="16">But a lot of sturm und drang! </sentence><sentence id="17">over many years. </sentence><sentence id="18">And so I, I, I was born in 1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What do you know about the <span class="populated place">towns</span> -- the <span class="populated place">villages</span> where your parents came from and why did they want to come here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. </sentence><sentence id="30">His mother died when he was very young. </sentence><sentence id="31">I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A Century of Time." </sentence><sentence id="32">And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the <span class="interior space">kitchen area</span>, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children. </sentence><sentence id="34">He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's <span class="building">bakery</span> in the winter and putting it under his coat and running to the edge of <span class="populated place">town</span> and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. </sentence><sentence id="35">So it was that kind of poverty. </sentence><sentence id="36">He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century. </sentence><sentence id="37">And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another <span class="populated place">town</span>, owning a <span class="building">bakery</span> of his own, hiding inside the <span class="building">bakery</span> arms of the anarchist movement -- and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. </sentence><sentence id="38">Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the <span class="country">United States</span>, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother came from another <span class="populated place">town</span>, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. </sentence><sentence id="40">I picked this up at the <span class="building">Museum of the Diaspora</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">The population of the <span class="populated place">town</span> declined by half -- 25, 3,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="42">And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65. </sentence><sentence id="44">And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. </sentence><sentence id="45">And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little <span class="building">butcher shop</span> to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for <span class="interior space">room</span> for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. </sentence><sentence id="46">And the son-in-law, husband of sis-- my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. </sentence><sentence id="47">So she was sent to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">So, it's a story of great poverty, the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Can you tell us both of their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Can you tell us both of their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="76"> A Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the family name. </sentence><sentence id="77">And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out the grandparent's names. </sentence><sentence id="78">Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. </sentence><sentence id="79">His father's name was Israel Feivel. </sentence><sentence id="80">My mother's father's name was, I had it and I lost it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: You'll remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: And the names of the <span class="populated place">towns</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: My mother came from <span class="populated place">Ivye</span> and my father came from <span class="populated place">Drozgenik</span> which was a sort of a small <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I, someone at the <span class="building">New York Public Library</span> gave me some alternative names to try to trace through Lithuanian sources. </sentence><sentence id="95">Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: What did your parents do here? </sentence><sentence id="101">When you were little, how did they make a living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="104"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="105">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="106"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Well, my father became a baker. </sentence><sentence id="108">My mother became a dressmaker. </sentence><sentence id="109">They happened to meet in a small <span class="interior space">tenement apartment</span> on the <span class="region">Lower East Side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">My father's older brother lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother's, but older than my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little baby at the time. </sentence><sentence id="111">And to keep things going they had <span class="interior space">boarders</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, there was a group of male boarders in one <span class="interior space">room</span> where my father stayed. </sentence><sentence id="113">And my mother stayed with two or three female boarders in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">And that's how they met and shacked up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. </sentence><sentence id="126">They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it. </sentence><sentence id="127">Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way. </sentence><sentence id="128">And -- but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, we grew up in a <span class="building">secular household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar mitzvahed. </sentence><sentence id="130">We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through <span class="building">Workman's Circle schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? </sentence><sentence id="132">and reads that. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I went through the Workman's Circle <span class="building">elementary schools</span>, <span class="building">high school</span>, and even into their sem- the <span class="building">seminary</span> for several years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Tell us what that is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, the <span class="building">elementary school</span> was somewhere in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: No, I mean the <span class="dlf">Workman's Circle</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: <span class="building">Workman's Circle</span> was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist movement, the Bund". </sentence><sentence id="150">And so, in, particularly at the <span class="building">high school</span> level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. </sentence><sentence id="152">Mendele,* Peretz,deg Sholom Aleichem, Ash", poets, but not taught Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="153">And it was an anti- Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. </sentence><sentence id="154">Anti- stateism, stateists. </sentence><sentence id="155">And I -- when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. </sentence><sentence id="156">After the war ended in <span class="country">Europe</span>, I got myself transferred to <span class="building">military government</span> and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection it. </sentence><sentence id="157">And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war. </sentence><sentence id="158">And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the <span class="building">Workman's Circle</span> complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into <span class="building">Workman's Circle</span> activity again. </sentence><sentence id="159">Because I felt I had been misguided, politically. </sentence><sentence id="160">And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky", who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you. </sentence><sentence id="162">And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion(r) and Labor and Mapai? </sentence><sentence id="163">and <span class="populated place">kibbutzim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism -- Zionist Poison." </sentence><sentence id="165">So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: What, in what way had they misguided you? </sentence><sentence id="185">What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. </sentence><sentence id="189">They were anti-stateist. </sentence><sentence id="190">They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl!deg and Weizman!"! </sentence><sentence id="191">and that group also. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a <span class="region">state</span> and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">They were the ones who were organizing the <span class="dlf">underground routes</span> to bring them to <span class="building">European ports</span> and transferring them to <span class="spatial object">ships</span> and sneaking them into <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194"><span class="country">America</span> was not open, the anti-- there were no anti-- there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into <span class="building">UNRRA</span>, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of <span class="country">Palestine</span> with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person. </sentence><sentence id="196"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my <span class="populated place">camp</span> on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the <span class="building">military</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="211">How did you go into it? </sentence><sentence id="212">Where did you go at first? </sentence><sentence id="213">What did you see and how did that affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="215">There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two. </sentence><sentence id="216">But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I remember us going to a <span class="building">naval recruiting station</span>, oh like 1943, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="218">And the fellow across the <span class="spatial object">desk</span> is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight?" </sentence><sentence id="219">And we're; "uh, huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for <span class="spatial object">LST</span>, for <span class="spatial object">landing ship tanks</span>, you know, to run the <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we leave the <span class="building">building</span> and one of us says to the other, "You know, I prefer <span class="env feature">terra firma</span>, the firmer the better." </sentence><sentence id="221">So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">I arrived at the <span class="dlf">beaches</span> in <span class="country">France</span>, moved to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: The year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: 1944, then, September. </sentence><sentence id="237">And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the <span class="region">ninth Division</span> at the <span class="dlf">Belgian boarder</span> -- <span class="env feature">Hiirtgen Forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">And overnight the <span class="env feature">Hiirtgen Forest</span> had some very special qualities; it was a tall <span class="env feature">forest</span> and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the <span class="env feature">trees</span> and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you. </sentence><sentence id="239">And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, that was my initiation into combat. </sentence><sentence id="241">But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I was with the <span class="building">ninth Infantry Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the <span class="region">area</span> in which the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> I went later, was in. </sentence><sentence id="244">My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries. </sentence><sentence id="245">And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="246">Anyway, so I was in battle for <span class="populated place">Aachen</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span> which is closest to the <span class="dlf">French border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">I crossed the <span class="env feature">Ruhr River</span>, <span class="populated place">Diiren</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">I was in the Battle of the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="249">We then moved into the <span class="env feature">Rhine</span> when that was over. </sentence><sentence id="250">And we were in <span class="populated place">Bad Godesburg</span> which is just south of <span class="populated place">Bonn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">Home to many governmental, <span class="building">German governmental offices</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the <span class="dlf">Remagen bridge</span> and they have sent people over it and we are put onto <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the <span class="dlf">site</span> and we're crossing the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> under direct fire from the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection other <span class="env feature">hills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">Like the <span class="env feature">Palisades</span> in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, crossing <span class="populated place">George Washington</span>, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we establish a <span class="dlf">beach head</span> on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="257">Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, was in the <span class="building">public relations unit</span> of the <span class="populated place">division</span> that took the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> originally. </sentence><sentence id="258">And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces. </sentence><sentence id="259">By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders. </sentence><sentence id="260">In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the <span class="region">American divisions</span>, moving through the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, bypassing the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Remagen</span>, came to the heights there above the <span class="env feature">river</span>, they look out and they see the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> is still standing. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was the only <span class="dlf">bridge</span> still standing. </sentence><sentence id="262">And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley!" , </sentence><sentence id="263">General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, "Shall -- which battle plan -- shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> standing?" </sentence><sentence id="264">And Ike says, "Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across." </sentence><sentence id="265">Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people. </sentence><sentence id="266">And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, get" -- he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on." </sentence><sentence id="267">And that shortened the war by two or three months. </sentence><sentence id="268">And so -- and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the <span class="env feature">Hiirtgen Forest</span> -- basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders. </sentence><sentence id="269">I adored Bradley. </sentence><sentence id="270">I adored Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="271">I thought they were the greatest in the world. </sentence><sentence id="272">And, and anyway, I fought all the way to <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">We could have moved on to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="275">And I, I feel great about having been a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="276">I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded. </sentence><sentence id="277">It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier. </sentence><sentence id="278">I been, you know, battle after battle. </sentence><sentence id="279">I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the <span class="region">Ruhr Valley</span>, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was part of the rotation scheme. </sentence><sentence id="281">Letting different soldiers take a few days from the <span class="dlf">front line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">And I went to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I'm walking -- I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story -- I'm walking along the <span class="dlf">Champs-Elysees</span>, and word spread that Roosevelt had died. </sentence><sentence id="284">Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he died. </sentence><sentence id="285">And then two days later I was back at the front. </sentence><sentence id="286">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="287">Anyway, then because of my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection prior education and <span class="building">settlement house</span> experience, I succeeded in getting myself transferred to military government. </sentence><sentence id="288">There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. </sentence><sentence id="289">And [had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. </sentence><sentence id="290">We were in, in a <span class="region">county</span>, incidentally, <span class="populated place">Landkreis</span>!, </sentence><sentence id="291">at <span class="populated place">Ginzburg</span>, which was between <span class="populated place">Ulm</span> and <span class="populated place">Augsberg</span>, and it happened to be the <span class="populated place">city</span>, I didn't notice at the, time, from which the Mengele family"* comes. </sentence><sentence id="292">I didn't know this. </sentence><sentence id="293">And as part of my duties for a few months, I set up a <span class="building">hospital</span> for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease. </sentence><sentence id="294">And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular encounter. </sentence><sentence id="295">And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. </sentence><sentence id="296">I set up the <span class="building">hospital</span> and then I would drive to the particular <span class="populated place">community</span> and try to identify the woman. </sentence><sentence id="297">I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever, "Who's Daisy around here?" </sentence><sentence id="298">And I'd bring her in. </sentence><sentence id="299">And all the way she would complain, she's "eine anstindige Frau,!*" </sentence><sentence id="300">she's a respectable woman, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="301">And then I'd bring them in, go on the <span class="interior space">ward</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">We had a group of nuns taking care of them. </sentence><sentence id="303">They were tested. </sentence><sentence id="304">Then by three days later they weren't giving me any argument that they were respectable women.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="387">Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. </sentence><sentence id="388">Which is my inspecting a -- some <span class="building">hospital facility</span> somewhere in this <span class="populated place">county</span> we were in, which was a <span class="building">hospital</span> for Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="389">I have absolutely no recall about it. </sentence><sentence id="390">If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP's, I would have said "no." </sentence><sentence id="391">Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of <span class="building">Harlem hospital</span> in 1961. </sentence><sentence id="393">It's a subliminal yearning I have. </sentence><sentence id="394">Anyway, so, anyway, that <span class="populated place">county</span> experience was a very interesting experience. </sentence><sentence id="395">And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I was called to serve at <span class="building">Supreme Headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> military government. </sentence><sentence id="396">They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish -- two years of German in <span class="building">college</span>, and Yiddish -- I was used as a translator of German documents into English. </sentence><sentence id="397">And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to <span class="populated place">Wetzlar</span> north of <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> to supervise the <span class="building">military government printing plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">That was printing military government documents. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it. </sentence><sentence id="400">And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the <span class="building">settlement house</span> that I had lived in for a year and a half while going to <span class="building">graduate school</span>, was in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and with <span class="building">UNRRA</span> and he was in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">So, occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I was to <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. </sentence><sentence id="402">And then, in November, I learned that he was leaving <span class="country">Germany</span> for, the States. </sentence><sentence id="403">He was going into the <span class="building">State Department</span> Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in <span class="populated place">Wiesbaden</span> one weekend, which was <span class="building">zone headquarters</span> for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and his name is Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. </sentence><sentence id="404">He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the <span class="country">Unite States</span> Mission to the United Nations, right after it was formed. </sentence><sentence id="405">A very able fellow. </sentence><sentence id="406">Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a <span class="building">printing

paper. </sentence><sentence id="1224">So, I, I decided I would go to the <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span> telephone book and look up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the <span class="building">Klausenburg Rabbi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And what was his first name. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1227">So I go to the

</sentence><sentence id="1229">And I see <span class="populated place">Halberstam</span>, it's almost a <span class="spatial object">column</span> long. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And what I see in this listing of <span class="building">Halberstams</span> is how many have attached to their name, "Rabbi." </sentence><sentence id="1231">So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Forty-three percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names. </sentence><sentence id="1233">That's the Halberstam lineage, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1234">I use statistics to illuminate, not lie. </sentence><sentence id="1235">I mean that is such a powerful fact, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1236">So, anyway, we're back.

id="1278">I had to choose. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And, and, I made that choice. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I mean, I don't recall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but it was that incident, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Now, let me just say, not only was the <span class="building">black market</span>, this problem. </sentence><sentence id="1283">You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1284">But, the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration

I've been to the <span class="building">National Archives</span> and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the <span class="building">National Archives</span>, trying to get some better understanding of the context. </sentence><sentence id="1287">And, incidentally, you find some very interesting material there on that. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I mean, for example, you come across cables, in late "45, the <span class="building">State Department</span> is cabling all the ambassadors in every <span class="country">country</span> in the world, asking on a top secret basis, "Is there any <span class="interior space">room</span> in your -- in the <span class="country">country</span> you are designated to, is there any <span class="interior space">room</span> for Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="1289">And then you see cables coming back -- I don't think I've read all the cables coming back -- but substantially, the answer is "no." </sentence><sentence id="1290">But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the <span class="building">State Department</span>, under pressure from the British with regard to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, want to explore what are the options? </sentence><sentence id="1291">Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the <span class="region">Eastern countries</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>, <span

<span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> and he's telling him about what he found. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Anyway, you come across all this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. </sentence><sentence id="1296">I've been exploring this in order to understand what I was in the middle of, you see? </sentence><sentence id="1297">Finally, I don't remember the date now, there's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy, whose the chief political officer at the office of military government, he was Ike's?"

what you're dealing with is the fact that the Jews don't want to live in a <span class="country">country</span> that was a <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> to their people, their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1300">They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim <span class="dlf">property</span>, there are killings. </sentence><sentence id="1301">They know that the

you'll see, there are understandable humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And it's a completely, it was a completely different outlook. </sentence><sentence id="1583">You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI's were fraternizing with German girls and German women -- widespread, extensive.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3119">A: Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before. </sentence><sentence id="3120">See, I'm, I'm an amalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. </sentence><sentence id="3121">And, I believe very strongly in this. </sentence><sentence id="3122">But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the existence, and probably the necessity, for the "we/they" relationships. </sentence><sentence id="3123">So, when I think about the "we/they" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it means to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification, values. </sentence><sentence id="3124">But, in a certain sense, as "we," we shouldn't kill them. </sentence><sentence id="3125">We should find a way of relating to the "they." </sentence><sentence id="3126">All "they's" should find ways of relating to the "we's." </sentence><sentence id="3127">So, ina certain sense in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the "we" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for balance in the "We/they" phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="3128">And the Army that I was dealing with -- which I don't generalize to the whole Army, became the they, more than the Germans -- became the they, in a sense -- and that probably does make me feel a little uncomfortable -- because for me, I strong -- I believe strongly that all people need to have a "we" relationship, but they shouldn't convert that "we" relationship into a hostile, hostility to "they." </sentence><sentence id="3129">You see? </sentence><sentence id="3130">I mean, if you take for example, that thing I went through quickly with you, about <span class="building">Harlem hospital</span>, where I was going in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days later, five days later was from their "we" into an act of aggression against the "they." </sentence><sentence id="3131">And it was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. </sentence><sentence id="3132">And, so you get this all the time, and, and because, sometimes it's because of the way in which they act. </sentence><sentence id="3133">That is the Katyisha*(r) <span class="spatial object">rockets</span> make our we act in certain ways. </sentence><sentence id="3134">And that distresses me, even though I accept the counteraction. </sentence><sentence id="3135">But, I basically prefer for the <span class="dlf">walls</span> to come down a little bit more among people. </sentence><sentence id="3136">Even though they need for their well-being, a "we" relationship. </sentence><sentence id="3137">So, in, in -- at <span class="building">UNRRA</span>, because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were building up some of the <span class="dlf">walls</span> in me that I feel uncomfortable with. </sentence><sentence id="3138">But, hell, even Rabbi Halberstam had a little bit of that, right? </sentence><sentence id="3139">So, I -- but I've learned -- what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the "we/they" relationships. </sentence><sentence id="3140">I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million things, focus on <span class="country">Sri Lanka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3141">I've been watching the <span class="country">Sri Lanka</span> phenomenon for 20 years,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 now. </sentence><sentence id="3142">I always find these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me, but show how difficult it is to deal with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
