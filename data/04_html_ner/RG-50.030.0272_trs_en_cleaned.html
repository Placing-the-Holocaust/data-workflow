<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: My father was born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> in 1888 and was an Austrian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="20">He served in the <span class="building">Austrian Navy</span> during the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="21">He studied engineering and was a mechanical engineer and at the time I was born, he was living in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> working for a <span class="building">multi-national company</span> that had <span class="building">offices</span> in a number of <span class="country">countries</span> and that's, as I said, where I was born. </sentence><sentence id="22">My mother was born in <span class="country">Germany</span> in what is today part of <span class="country">Poland</span> and I think it's in <span class="populated place">Silesa</span> or <span class="populated place">Pomerania</span> and she married my father I believe two or three years before I was born. </sentence><sentence id="23">I don't have the exact date and according to then existing European convention and laws she became an Austrian citizen the moment that she married my father and I, although born in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, automatically acquired the citizenship of my father. </sentence><sentence id="24">So, I was Austrian also. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: We were very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="181">As far as I can remember at least in 1934 or 1935, I think we had at least two servants in the <span class="building">house</span> and my father drove a big fat <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">If I had it today, it would be worth a fortune and we lived a very very comfortable life going on summer vacations either to the <span class="env feature">seashore</span> or the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span> or travelling to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">We lived well. </sentence><sentence id="184">No question about that. </sentence><sentence id="185">We had a <span class="building">villa</span> at first. </sentence><sentence id="186">Later on we moved into an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> before we left and we were in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> until about 1936, until about the middle of 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: You mentioned that your father's attitude was that he didn't think that what was happening applied to him. </sentence><sentence id="195">Were your parents observant Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="199">Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="200">I mean there was . . . </sentence><sentence id="201">Judaism was not practiced, no religion was practiced. </sentence><sentence id="202">I remember as a child, I think the only time that I ever set food in a <span class="building">synagogue</span> was for the wedding of a friend or a relative of my parents and apparently I scandalized everyone when in the middle of the ceremony I loudly said to my grandmother, "Grandma, look at my beautiful brand new black patent leather shoes." </sentence><sentence id="203">I seemed to have interrupted the ceremony but that's about the only thing that I can remember about it. </sentence><sentence id="204">We never had a <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> in the <span class="building">house</span> or <span class="spatial object">mezuzah</span> at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">This was unknown. </sentence><sentence id="206">The only other symbol or connection to Judaism if you will was at Easter time, at Passover time, there was usually matzo at <span class="building">home</span> which my father used to love. </sentence><sentence id="207">He loved to eat and also it was broken up into pieces and put into a <span class="spatial object">bowl</span> and then you poured coffee, milk and sugar on top of it and eat it that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Did you, as a child, did you know that you were Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="219">Did you think about that at all? </sentence><sentence id="220">Did you have Jewish friends or was it just not a concept that was mentioned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: It didn't mean anything to me. </sentence><sentence id="225">It was not something I was aware of. </sentence><sentence id="226">I don't recall ever having been harassed in <span class="building">school</span> while I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> during the first year. </sentence><sentence id="227">The name Feigl is a very common Austrian name and if you look in the <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> telephone book today, you'll probably find something like 30 or 40 Feigls listed there spelled the way ours was spelled. </sentence><sentence id="228">F-E-I-G-L. F-E-I-G-E-L would have been a more Jewish name but G-L was a typical Austrian name, almost as common if you will, as Smith in the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Can you tell me how it was then that you all came to leave <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence><sentence id="230">Do you remember very much of that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Yes, about "36, mid-"36, my father was told to go to <span class="populated place">Prague</span> and close down the <span class="building">branch office</span> in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">Apparently, this <span class="building">office</span> didn't do very well. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was not profitable. </sentence><sentence id="234">So, the entire family moved to <span class="populated place">Prague</span> and the move was totally unrelated to what was going on politically in <span class="country">Germany</span> at the time and we lived in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> for a year. </sentence><sentence id="235">I certainly found myself thrown into a <span class="region">Czech-speaking environment</span> which I apparently picked up within six months, I was speaking Czech in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="236">I was seven years old and we lived in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> for one year and then went back to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">When I say back to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> to my father's birth place and where what I thought was the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the <span class="building">company</span> and established <span class="building">residence</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and it must have been in early 1937. </sentence><sentence id="238">At that point, the problem of Jewish persecution and so forth must have concerned my father because at that time he decided to have me baptized Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="239">Over 95-percent of the Austrian population is Catholic and he thought that as an Austrian being a Catholic certainly couldn't do me any harm and so at the age of nine, I'm sorry, eight and a half, I was baptized by a Cardinal Innitzer. </sentence><sentence id="240">He had arranged to have the Cardinal baptize me and I went into <span class="building">catechism school</span> and basically thought of myself as Catholic at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: This was the first religious training that you had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: That's right, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Did you go to mass? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: I, well, I went to mass for communion when it was required and for confession and so forth in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="258">Subsequently, I didn't go because my parents didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="259">Later on in the 1940s when I was in <span class="country">France</span> and various <span class="building">children's homes</span> and so forth, suddenly being Catholic became useful again and in some places where the children were marched off to go to mass in the morning, I tagged along and then some places I was even, was alter boy and served mass. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Were you in a <span class="building">public school</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Yes, I was in a <span class="building">public school</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and I guess about one year until the Anschluss came in March of 1938 when <span class="country">Germany</span> annexed <span class="country">Austria</span> and at that point my father actually on the day of the Anschluss was outside the <span class="country">country</span> on one of his many business trips and my mother was hoping that he would remain abroad so that he could send for us but after struggling for three days, my father managed to appear  back <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> triumphantly that he had managed to smuggle himself back into <span class="country">Austria</span> on a cold <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, inside a cold <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, coming out of <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and he was all covered with soot and looked like a chimney sweep and there he was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Do you remember him... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: I remember it because it was a big fight between my mother and my father at that time. </sentence><sentence id="270">My mother was furious that he had returned. </sentence><sentence id="271">She thought he was an idiot for not having stayed abroad and just calling for us to join him and he on the other hand was trying to defend his actions that he couldn't just leave us and abandon us and there was no guarantee that he could get us out and that's what he gets for struggling and risking his life to come back to get us. </sentence><sentence id="272">It was a big argument. </sentence><sentence id="273">I also remember that on the day of the Anschluss in 1938, so I had just turned nine years old, I left that morning and we lived in the vicinity of the <span class="building">city hall</span>, the <span class="building">Vienna Rathaus</span> and I went down there and I saw these tens of thousands of people on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and all the German flags and the music and the band and everything else and I was in there with the mass of the people shouting my head off like everybody else, "Ein <span class="env feature">volk</span>, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer", one people, one Reich and one leader and I actually saw Hitler on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> up there on the <span class="building">Rathaus</span> and when I finally got <span class="building">home</span>, my mother was beside herself, she didn't know, "Where have you been?You've been gone for six hours you know?" </sentence><sentence id="274">And I said, "I saw our Fuhrer." </sentence><sentence id="275">Where upon my mother slapped me left and right and said, "Never call that SOB again "Our Fuhrer". </sentence><sentence id="276">He is not "Our Fuhrer"." </sentence><sentence id="277">And I guess that's the first time that I came to the realization, wait a minute, some how I don't fit in, we don't fit into the grandiose schemes of this maniac but as I said, at nine I really, I wanted to have a uniform like all the other kids who were going, who were joining the Hitler Jugend. </sentence><sentence id="278">You know, and have a little dagger and sand brown belt and march to the music and the <span class="spatial object">drums</span> and all this is fascinating and hypnotizing for a young kid. </sentence><sentence id="279">But shortly after that I think within a matter of two weeks, my father managed to get himself transferred to <span class="country">Belgium</span> and we immigrated hurriedly and left most of our <span class="dlf">property</span> in <span class="country">Austria</span> and fled to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Do you remember were there other relatives, what they were thinking at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="295">Were there discussions among the family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I was a child and in those days children were told you're here to be seen, not to be heard and I really . . . </sentence><sentence id="297">I cannot recollect any discussions about the dangers and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="298">I don't think that this is something that dawned on me until we left very hurriedly from <span class="country">Austria</span> to go to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">I believe that my father at some time, some where got the German authorities mad at him because he refused to cooperate on importing some materials which they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="300">| think it was <span class="spatial object">aircraft engines</span> to which  he had access and I believe that they were trying to get him to import <span class="spatial object">aircraft engines</span> either into <span class="country">Belgium</span> or into <span class="country">Austria</span> and then transship from there as agricultural machinery into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">I know the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, <span class="country">Germany</span> was prohibited from importing any war materials and so forth and he felt at the time that as an Austrian, they couldn't harm him and he more or less told them to go to hell and he then realized that now that the Germans are in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, I'm probably on their black list and they'll want to get even which I think was the primary motivating force behind his leaving hurriedly and getting out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What about your <span class="building">school</span> during that Spring of that year? </sentence><sentence id="309">Did the teachers talk about, do you remember any mood or change? </sentence><sentence id="310">Was it obvious to you as a child that something was happening or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: I can't really say that I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="315">I mean, yes, all of a sudden there was swastika flags in the <span class="interior space">school room</span> and Hitler's picture was up on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> but other than that, no, I remember that I wanted to be like the others and I knew that the large majority of my classmates were either joining the Hitler youth or other activities and my parents sent me to the boy scouts and I didn't think that their uniforms were as attractive as the uniforms of the Hitler uniform, so. </sentence><sentence id="316">But... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Did the other children taunt to you in any way for not joining? </sentence><sentence id="321">Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="325">I know, I think in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> I think, a couple of times I was busted in the nose by some of the kids in <span class="building">school</span> who called me a Jew and it really upset me because my answer was I'm not a Jew, I'm Catholic but other than that I can't really say that I was aware of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: But they were somehow? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: I guess they were. </sentence><sentence id="331">Obviously anti-Semitism was rampant but I also know that at one point my mother was paraded through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> after the Anschluss and they hung a sign around her neck saying that this pig woman bought in a Jewish- owned <span class="building">store</span> and my mother apparently tried to tell them that she was Jewish and they wouldn't believe her. </sentence><sentence id="332">They paraded her through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> with a <span class="spatial object">sign</span> around her neck. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: Who did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: I guess the local Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was just a few days after the Anschluss. </sentence><sentence id="340">I also remember  my mother being very upset. </sentence><sentence id="341">We had moved into a brand new <span class="building">apartment building</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">At that time it was brand new and downstairs on the <span class="interior space">street level</span> there was a small <span class="building">grocery shop</span> where you got your essentials, milk, butter, essential food items and so on, a small <span class="building">store</span> and, of course, my mother when we moved there they immediately recognized that she was German by her accent. </sentence><sentence id="343">She didn't speak like an Austrian like in <span class="populated place">Viennese</span> and the <span class="building">store</span> owners always engaged her in conversation and were somewhat differential to her and I know that quite often the conversation turned around Hitler, <span class="country">Germany</span> and the shop keeper would always say to my mother, "Well, just let him try to come here into <span class="country">Austria</span>, we'll show him, we'll throw him out in no time." </sentence><sentence id="344">On the morning of the Anschluss, when my mother went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> to get her milk and bread in the <span class="building">shop</span>, the first thing that the man greeted her with was Heil Hitler, Frau Feigl, and my mother was astonished. </sentence><sentence id="345">I mean overnight this man suddenly became a Nazi and as she left the <span class="building">store</span> she looked in the <span class="dlf">window</span> of the <span class="dlf">door</span> and there was a big sign, "From today on the Germans salute is Heil Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="346">And the other day prior to that it was always, as the Austrian say, "Gruss Gott", which is little translation is "God be with you" or "God's Greetings" and from one overnight it because Heil Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="347">I also remember that across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from us in our <span class="building">apartment building</span> and everywhere there were swastika flags that hung from the <span class="interior space">third floor</span> or the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> of the <span class="building">buildings</span> and it reached to within four or five feet of the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">I mean, humongus flags. </sentence><sentence id="349">This obviously was something that didn't just happen overnight. </sentence><sentence id="350">I mean, this had been anticipated. </sentence><sentence id="351">It had been prepared and so forth but I also remember that the night before the Anschluss, my mother was listening to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and apparently the Austrian Chancellor at that time, made a speech and I remember my mother being in tears about it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="352">But again, I didn't really understand the political upheaval of the time. </sentence><sentence id="353">I just knew it was upsetting to her but I didn't know exactly why or what. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: Well, as I mentioned I think my father quickly came to the realization that either the illusion that he had created for himself that as an Austrian, the problem of the Jews was not his it was a German problem and now he suddenly found that there are no more Austrians and he was a German Jew at this point and certainly by the definition of the Nazis, which made it a racial definition rather than a question of credence and belief, and then also I think I remember discussions between my mother and my father about, you shouldn't have done that when you were in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and I think that that related to the fact that he more or less rejected some of the inducements or enticements that the Nazis had offered and I think my mother felt that this is going to haunt you some day and now is the time, they are here to haunt you. </sentence><sentence id="489">They are going to come and get you and I believe my father, because of that, managed to get a transfer to <span class="country">Belgium</span> and to get his assignment to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and he left first and we followed a few weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="490">We followed and we settled into <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> at that time and he would commute daily from <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">I think that <span class="country">Belgium</span> at that time had a very high speed mass transit system and you could move from <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> in less than an hour and so every morning he would go to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and commute to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="496">Q: He went ahead and found a place for you to live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="498">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="499">We moved first into a small <span class="building">apartment building</span>, and then later on into a larger <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">The smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span> later was occupied by my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, who also came to <span class="country">Belgium</span> at about that time and she is the one that we subsequently fled with from <span class="country">Belgium</span> into <span class="country">France</span> and she ultimately made it to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: She had been in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: Is she coming from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="513">But I don't know how exactly or when, she obviously went from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> directly  2 to <span class="country">Belgium</span> rather than through <span class="country">Austria</span> and it's only speculation on my part, possibly she may have been asked by my mother to come and join them in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="516">Q: Do you have any recollection about the trip from <span class="country">Austria</span> to <span class="country">Belgium</span>, passing through <span class="building">customs</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: Only, yes, only that the <span class="dlf">border crossing</span> was very traumatic to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="519">Everybody had to get off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, stood in <span class="dlf">line</span> for quite some time, every piece of luggage had to be put up on a <span class="spatial object">table</span> there for control people, inspectors, I don't remember whether these were customs people or Gestapo people but they went through every piece of clothing in the <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and checked everything possibly looking for smuggled jewels or money or whatever and it took a long time to get through the inspection and when we were finally allowed back into the railway cards and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> got moving into <span class="country">Belgium</span>, I think there was a big sigh of relief on the part of everyone that they had made it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: Did you and your mother travel . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: It was just my mother and | at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: And how much did you have with you? </sentence><sentence id="527">What did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: I can't tell you exactly. </sentence><sentence id="531">My guess is we must have had four or five <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="532">I know that, of course, when my father left he must have also managed to take along at least one <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> I know of because he had, which was at the time, a very novel <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>, it was sort of an expandable thing with expanding hinges and I think he probably mentioned that he, I think he bought it in the <span class="country">United States</span> and that it was an American invention, very fancy <span class="spatial object">leather suitcase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">He had that all the way until we ultimately met again in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="534">So I know he got that <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> out of <span class="country">Austria</span> when he left. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: But you all immigrated legally? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: That was a legal immigration out of <span class="country">Austria</span> into <span class="country">Belgium</span> and I'm sure that it was made easy by virtue of the fact that my father had a foreign assignment from an Austrian, now German company since <span class="country">Austria</span> overnight disappeared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Well I'm sure your mother was quite frightened for whatever reason that she may not be able to imagine, she couldn't get back to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: Yes, there was that, although perhaps a word about my mother here. </sentence><sentence id="541">Between my  3 father and my mother, my mother was by far the stronger of the two persons. </sentence><sentence id="542">Both physically stronger. </sentence><sentence id="543">She was much taller than my father and my mother had been a gymmastics teacher and I think also as far as inner character, inner convictions are concerned, I think my mother was the stronger of my two parents. </sentence><sentence id="544">My mother was also about 16 years younger than my father. </sentence><sentence id="545">So there was quite a considerable age difference which by the way was very common in those days. </sentence><sentence id="546">My wife, for instance, [PAGE 19 ENDS HERE -- THEN JUMPS TO PAGE 35. </sentence><sentence id="547">PAGES 20 THROUGH 34 ARE MISSING] BEGINNING OF PAGE 34: never had a case like that, go to the <span class="populated place">prefecture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">So she goes to the <span class="populated place">prefecture</span> and goes through the same routine and they send her back to somewhere else and after about four or five times of being sent from one to the other, someone finally said to her, ah Madame, we know exactly how to deal with cases such as yours, there is a place, it's called <span class="populated place">Olorons St. Marie</span>, it's in the <span class="env feature">Pyrenees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="549">You go there and they know exactly how to deal with cases such as yours. </sentence><sentence id="550">So with the little money that my mother had left, she buys a railway ticket to <span class="populated place">Olorons St. Marie</span> for herself, her mother and for me. </sentence><sentence id="551">We get on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we go to <span class="populated place">Olorons St. Marie</span> and as we arrive at the <span class="building">railway station</span>, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is surrounding with French Gendarmes with machine guns and they take us off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and put us on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and the next stop was a French concentration <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Camp De Gurs</span> and we found ourselves in the <span class="populated place">Gurs camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552"><span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in the <span class="env feature">Pyrenees mountains</span> which had been built in the 1930s by the French to house the fleeing Spanish, mostly community people that fled the Spanish revolutionary war and suddenly this <span class="populated place">camp</span> had been turned into a <span class="populated place">holding camp</span> or a concentration <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">It was not an <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">For all these refugees, now most of these refugees who were in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> now, aside from the Spaniards that were still there were now Jewish refugees getting German Jews, French Jews, <span class="country">Romania</span>, Belgian Jews, Dutch Jews, whoever was able to flee was in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">My mother, this is 1940s, so she is about 36 or 38 years old, she was in her prime and as I said she was physically very fit, she was immediately picked to become a <span class="building">barracks</span> chief. </sentence><sentence id="556">So as <span class="building">barracks</span> chief she had a lot of freedom within the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, that is to move from <span class="building">barrack</span> to <span class="building">barrack</span> or to move from one <span class="dlf">I Lot</span>, as they call them, or <span class="env feature">islands</span>, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was sort of divided into <span class="env feature">islands</span> and she was responsible for going every day to pick up the food that was allotted to our <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="557">So, she knew what was going on in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">She was well informed about the happenings and so on and we basically were in wooden <span class="building">barracks</span> with just straw on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, there were no <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span>, no <span class="spatial object">beds</span> or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="559">A lot of people were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="560">There was not enough food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="561">Obviously, the French had not anticipated an influx of that many people and they were totally unprepared for handling the influx of people that suddenly showed up. </sentence><sentence id="562">The conditions were miserable. </sentence><sentence id="563">The <span class="spatial object">toilets</span> were open trench latrines, there was no  4 hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="564">There was no running water. </sentence><sentence id="565">A lot of people got sick and, of course, again, a lot of the people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> were elderly people and children and women with children and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="566">So, we were in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> for I guess it was about almost six weeks or so, close to six weeks and my mother had a run-in with some nuns that were put in charge of the food supply and as <span class="building">barracks</span> chief my mother tried to beg, plead, borrow anything to try to get an extra ration of bread or an extra can of sardines or an extra something in each <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">I think each <span class="building">barrack</span> held about sixty to seventy people that she had to feed and one of the nuns lectured her and said, Madame, you do not live to eat, you eat to live. </sentence><sentence id="568">Whereupon my mother hauled out and slapped her. </sentence><sentence id="569">It did get her an extra supply of rations. </sentence><sentence id="570">Anyhow, after about six weeks or so, when the French were about to surrender in late June of 1940, my mother learned that there was a Wehrmacht, a German army inspection group that was expected the next morning at the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and this is where the passport thing comes in. </sentence><sentence id="571">For some reason, my mother's passport had not been stamped with a "J". </sentence><sentence id="572">So my mother said, I want to get out of this damn <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="573">We've got to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="574">We'll starve to death in here. </sentence><sentence id="575">She went to the main <span class="dlf">entrance gate</span> of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in the morning when the Germans were expected and as soon as she saw the head of the German group, she went over to him and yelled, "Heil Hitler Herr Oberst. </sentence><sentence id="576">I am a German citizen, I demand to be released from this stinking, filthy <span class="populated place">camp</span> immediately with my children. </sentence><sentence id="577">These damn Frenchmen have kept us locked up here for six weeks." </sentence><sentence id="578">And she showed her passport to him and he just looked at it and looked at me and my mother had her mother's passport and opened it up and with her passport on top of it, she was hiding the "J", and the German officer was so taken back, he just turned to the <span class="populated place">French camp</span> commander who had come in there, then said, "You let Madame out immediately with her mother and her son and you call a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> and you make arrangements with the <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> that you pay for him and he takes them wherever they want to go." </sentence><sentence id="579">Within five minutes, we were out. </sentence><sentence id="580">My mother told the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="630">I was standing by her. </sentence><sentence id="631">She had taken me along and obviously she was all packed and ready to go, she figured it's either going to work or it won't. </sentence><sentence id="632">We drove for several hours and came to a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Auch</span>, <span class="populated place">A-U-C-H</span>, which was a little bit in the <span class="region">area</span> <span class="populated place">Toulouse</span>, in the south of <span class="country">France</span>, and as we approached the <span class="populated place">city</span> limits and the <span class="populated place">town limits</span>, we were crossing <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, and all of a sudden a group of people came toward us and waved at us, and said, "Stop, stop, don't go any further, the Germans are on the other side of <span class="populated place">town</span>." </sentence><sentence id="633">So, my mother looked around and she saw that there was a <span class="building">convent</span> off there to the left side of the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> and so she took our bags and me and my grandmother and dismissed the cab driver and we walked across the open <span class="dlf">field</span> over to the <span class="building">convent</span> and she knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and the nuns  5 took us in and for the next six weeks we lived in this <span class="building">convent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="634">Whether the fact that I was Catholic had something to do with it, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="635">I don't know whether my mother played that card or not. </sentence><sentence id="636">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="637">But the nuns did take us in and during the five or six weeks that we spent in the <span class="building">convent</span>, the nuns made contact with various, or they were in contact with various refugee assistance aid organizations and among them a group of American Quakers who had a food distribution and <span class="building">refugee assistance office</span> in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, in <span class="populated place">Auch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="638">So my mother was offered a job with the Quakers to help in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="639">It was a part-time job but it enabled her to leave the <span class="building">convent</span> and find a one-room <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and moved into it. </sentence><sentence id="640">My mother also earned extra money becoming a cleaning lady and now at this point I don't remember what happened to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="641">She somehow left at this point. </sentence><sentence id="642">I don't know what but she left us in <span class="populated place">Auch</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="657">Q: Do you know why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="659">A: I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="660">I think that she must have somehow managed to contact her daughter, the other daughter, the younger one who had lived in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and somehow, at some point, she managed to rejoin her and managed to get into <span class="country">Spain</span> and from <span class="country">Spain</span> into <span class="country">Portugal</span> and from <span class="country">Portugal</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="661">Now, I think it had something to do with the fact my aunt's husband, the one she married in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, his name was Joel Bloomberg (ph), he was called Jole Bloomberg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="662">He was very active in Zionist activities and so forth and he was, I think a Latvian or Lithuanian nationality so he had a passport from one of those <span class="country">countries</span> and at that time those <span class="country">countries</span> were not yet involved in the war so he was, if you will, a citizen of a neutral country, my aunt had acquired his nationality when she married him and I think that that helped them to obtain the necessary visas and he had been traveling back and forth on Zionist movement activities to the <span class="country">United States</span>, to <span class="country">Palestine</span> and to many <span class="country">countries</span> throughout Europe. </sentence><sentence id="663">I think he was a lecturer also and lectured in many places. </sentence><sentence id="664">So he had a great deal of mobility, if you will, and I think that's how somehow they managed to get her, my grandmother, to join them and to ultimately come to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">I think they made it to the <span class="country">States</span> about 1941 or so before <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span>, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="666">I know they spent a great deal of time in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> waiting for both first their visa and then their passage. </sentence><sentence id="667">There was limited <span class="interior space">space</span> available on <span class="spatial object">ships</span> at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="677">Q: Do you know what organization he was with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="679">A: No, I do not. </sentence><sentence id="680">He, as I said, he did make it to the <span class="country">States</span> and I remember in conversations, his name had been mentioned on a few occasions and they say, oh, yes, we know Joe Bloomberg (ph). </sentence><sentence id="681">So, he was quite active in the, I would say in late "30s. </sentence><sentence id="682"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="687">Q: Do you remember when your grandmother left you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="689">A: No, I really don't. </sentence><sentence id="690">I just know that all of a sudden I have no memory. </sentence><sentence id="691">I know that she was gone and so I know that we lived in this <span class="interior space">apartment</span> alone and now my mother's frantic search started to try and find out where is her husband, where is my father. </sentence><sentence id="692">She turned the world upside down through police, Gendarmes, the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span>, the Quakers, anyone who would listen, she would try to find out whatever happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="693">I think it was several months until she finally found out where he was. </sentence><sentence id="694">He had been transported from <span class="populated place">Chen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">They then went to the south of <span class="country">France</span> to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> whose name I cannot think of it right now, and from that <span class="populated place">camp</span> they went to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">St. Cyprien</span> which was on the <span class="env feature">Mediterranean coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">So now we knew where he was, we started to get letters, he had apparently taken to quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="697">I think they call it here, <span class="env feature">water</span> in the legs, I think it was a heart related situation and of course, inadequate medical care and so forth and somewhere around 1940 or early 1941 his physical condition had deteriorated to such a point that the French authorities decided to send him <span class="building">home</span> on a convalescent leave, figuring that within the next 30 days he'll die and he might as well die outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> instead of in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and save us the cost of burying him. </sentence><sentence id="698">I think it was in the Spring of "41. </sentence><sentence id="699">It had been a terrible, terrible winter. </sentence><sentence id="700">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was flooded. </sentence><sentence id="701">Where my father was, there had been bad floods. </sentence><sentence id="702">They had typhoid outbreaks, I believe and a lot of people died during that winter. </sentence><sentence id="703">So, he then came to <span class="populated place">Auch</span> and joined us in a <span class="interior space">one-bedroom apartment</span>, a <span class="interior space">one-room apartment</span>, and he then was able to stay with us literally by a month by month basis. </sentence><sentence id="704">Each month they wold renew his thirty-day convalescent leave and extend it for another thirty days and sometimes for sixty days and he had to find some means of earning a living and he couldn't accept a job because nobody would employ him. </sentence><sentence id="705">I mean he was not a French citizen and didn't have the right to work unless he created work for himself so his old experience with Champion Spark Plugs, he found a <span class="interior space">garage</span> where they had a spark plug cleaner which is basically a <span class="spatial object">metal stand</span> with a can full of sand at the bottom and you hook it up to a high pressure air hose and then you take a dirty spark plug and just put it in at the top and the air blows the sand into the spark plug and it cleans it out. </sentence><sentence id="706">So since it was impossible to get spark plugs anyhow at that time, he had a great idea and he started a spark plug cleaning business, a one-man operation. </sentence><sentence id="707">And he was able to earn a little bit of money that way doing that sort of work. </sentence><sentence id="708">My mother continued to work with the Quakers and in 1941 in the summer through these connections I was sent to a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> at <span class="env feature">Lake Annecy</span> which was very pleasant for me, the food was good and so on. </sentence><sentence id="709">This is obviously something that mother had managed to arrange through these aid organizations that she was working with and the word Quakers kept popping up, the Quakers, the American Friends. </sentence><sentence id="710">In 1942 in the summer, she again arranged for me to go to a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> during school vacation and this time I was  7 sent to a small <span class="populated place">town</span> about thirty miles from <span class="populated place">Auch</span>, a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Condon</span> and there was a <span class="building">chateau</span> and there were about thirty some odd kids there at <span class="populated place">summer camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Before we go to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, do you remember your father coming back? </sentence><sentence id="734">Do you remember when he arrived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="737">A: Yes, he looked terrible. </sentence><sentence id="738">I mean he must have lost a good fifty or sixty pounds. </sentence><sentence id="739">He was literally skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="740">In one of my diaries, I have a picture of him, a picture that had been taken in order to apply for a visa so a passport-type photograph and when you compare that with what he looked like, a year and a half before, it was like day and night. </sentence><sentence id="741">He was a little bit on the heavier side before then. </sentence><sentence id="742">He enjoyed good food and so he was totally emaciated and he seemed to have aged fifteen years or something like that in that time period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="749">Q: How did he get to <span class="populated place">Auch</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: Did you meet him someplace? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="757">A: I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="758">I think I was in <span class="building">school</span> when he came back and I ran <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span> and he was there. </sentence><sentence id="759">So, my mother must have met him or I don't know exactly how the reunion took place but I saw him again for the first in a year in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: You had been separated for a year? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: It must have been very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="769">A: Yes, it was. </sentence><sentence id="770">But, I also realize that there were big problems. </sentence><sentence id="771">It was a very small one- room <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="772">There was no privacy. </sentence><sentence id="773">I remember my mother basically sponge bathing in a little basin of water she would stand in and I remember seeing her naked in the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="774">I mean, there was no other place to go. </sentence><sentence id="775">So, to literally you live there, you slept there, you cooked there and so forth, but my father suddenly became a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="776">in the <span class="interior space">backyard</span> there was <span class="spatial object">cages</span> and he raised rabbits in there for food and there were a couple of chickens that provided a few eggs and he planted potatoes and string beans and peas and so forth that he showered a lot of attention and love and so forth on them and tomatoes to provide us with food. </sentence><sentence id="777"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: In that couple of years, with the three of you living in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, what was your parents outlook? </sentence><sentence id="788">Were they just saying let's just be happy here and stay here or were they... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="791">A: No, that's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="792">Their reason for going on, for living was only one thing and that is to get out of <span class="country">France</span> and get a visa and go to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="793">Especially after they had learned that my grandmother and my mother's sister and my uncle were already in <span class="country">Portugal</span> waiting to get to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="794">My parents wanted to do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="795">My father had approached his business contacts in the <span class="country">United States</span>, <span class="spatial object">Champion Spark Plug</span>. </sentence><sentence id="796">There was another company called Styckgold and <span class="building">Stackgold</span> that they had extensive dealings with. </sentence><sentence id="797">It was a <span class="building">company</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="798">He wrote to Mr. Styckgold and he wrote to Mr. Stackgold and invariably we wish we could help you but . . . </sentence><sentence id="799">and it was very disturbing for them. </sentence><sentence id="800">I still have many of the letters that they wrote to my grandmother after she came to the <span class="country">United States</span> which my grandmother left to me when she died and it's a very sad story listening to what my parents had to say at the time. </sentence><sentence id="801">There were utter frustrations for them, they found themselves in a chicken and egg situation. </sentence><sentence id="802">Yes, we will give you a visa to <span class="country">Spain</span>, if you have a visa for <span class="country">Portugal</span>, yes <span class="country">Portugal</span> said we will give you a visa to come to <span class="country">Portugal</span> provided you have a visa to go on to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="803">Yes, you can have a visa for the <span class="country">United States</span> once you get your quota number but we're not going to assign you a number until you can show us that you have booked passage on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="804">The <span class="building">shipping company</span> said we will not book passes on this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> unless you first have a visa to go to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="805">I mean it was, they were just constantly running up against this kind of a problem or you must come up with so many hundred of dollars which today would be equal to in the tens of thousands of dollars to ensure that you have a priority on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> or to ensure that you get a visa or you get a <span class="dlf">passage</span> or what have you and they didn't have that money. </sentence><sentence id="806">We lived pretty close to the poverty level in <span class="populated place">Auch</span> so it was hopeless. </sentence><sentence id="807">He kept writing to, my father and my mother both kept writing to my relatives in the <span class="country">States</span> at that point and they had just recently arrived. </sentence><sentence id="808">They were basically penniless. </sentence><sentence id="809">My father would tell my grandmother, you've got to telephone Mr. Styckgold, you've got to telephone Mr. Stackgold. </sentence><sentence id="810">I've written to them. </sentence><sentence id="811">You've got to get in touch with <span class="building">Champion Spark Plug</span>'s management. </sentence><sentence id="812">They know me. </sentence><sentence id="813">They've dealt with me. </sentence><sentence id="814">Talk to Mr. so and so. </sentence><sentence id="815">Talk to Mr. so and so and it was just all in vain, nothing but frustration. </sentence><sentence id="816">So, those were very very difficult days for them again, they did everything in their power to shield me from this such as sending me off to these <span class="populated place">children's colonies</span>, <span class="populated place">summer camps</span> and so forth and this brings us basically to the 1942 period and it was in 1942 that the Germans in cooperation with the French Vichy government decided on their policy to round up the Jews in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">The French thought that well, if we're going to round up Jews, let's first try and round up the foreign Jews. </sentence><sentence id="818">That way maybe we can protect the French Jews. </sentence><sentence id="819">The French Prime Minister, Laval, when the Germans asked that they  9 round up the Jews in <span class="country">France</span>, he only asked for the adults and Laval said, please take the children too. </sentence><sentence id="820">You want to keep the families together, don't you? </sentence><sentence id="821">And the Germans said, no, we don't want the children and Laval insisted until finally they said, well alright we'll take the kids too but there was basically something that Laval, Frenchman, was pushing for and at this point, July, let's see, end of June, early July, just before I left for the <span class="populated place">children's colony</span>, <span class="building">school</span> vacation starts on the fourteenth of July generally in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="822">So, I know I remember that there were a lot of whispered discussions going on in our <span class="interior space">one-room apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">There was a lot of worry. </sentence><sentence id="824">I would pick up words about raffles, <span class="building">razzigs</span>, they're rounding up people. </sentence><sentence id="825">People are being shipped off, nobody knows where. </sentence><sentence id="826">So, I was somewhat aware of something was brewing and that there was danger here but then came vacation time and I was sent off and I was with other kids and forgot all about this. </sentence><sentence id="827">Sometime in early August, my father came to visit me at the <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> and he made a very long trip on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, thirty miles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: Do you want to take a break? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: No, it's okay. </sentence><sentence id="868">For a man who was sick and he came to visit me and I remember on the back of the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> he had square <span class="spatial object">cookie box</span> and out of the <span class="spatial object">cookie box</span> he produced a small bag that my mother had sewn and it contained my father's pocket watch and he had a black fob with a gold Buddha attached to it and his silver pencil which he was very proud of, he had gotten it in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="869">It was sort of a four color mechanical pencil and a ring from my mother, a broach, a few other items, a small amount of money and he gave it to me and told me to look after it and at first it didn't register with me. </sentence><sentence id="870">Why are they doing this? </sentence><sentence id="871">Why is he doing this? </sentence><sentence id="872">And after he spent a couple of hours with me, he climbed back on his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and headed back to <span class="populated place">Auch</span> and as the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> disappeared over the top of the <span class="dlf">hill</span>, the crest of the <span class="dlf">hill</span>, I broke out crying and somehow I had the feeling I would never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="873">It was a few days later, maybe ten days, four days later or so that the director of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a very kind woman, Mrs. Cavaillon, she called me to her <span class="building">office</span> and she announced to me that she had bad news, she had been informed that my parents had been arrested in <span class="populated place">Auch</span> the day before and they didn't know where they were taken. </sentence><sentence id="874">There was no information and I was obviously very upset and she was a very devoted, very religious woman, a Catholic woman, and I had been going to mass almost daily. </sentence><sentence id="875">She encouraged everyone to go to mass everyday and this was not a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="876">I think I was probably the only Jewish child there. </sentence><sentence id="877">These were all French children from I would say middle or lower middle class families who found a <span class="building">summer home</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="878">She also told me that they were going to hold a novena, nine days of prayer and after nine days, my parents would be returned to me and there was nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="879">A day or two later I was again called by her and I was told that they are going to have to make me sick because she had a phone call from the police, from the  0 gendarme and they alerted her and told her that they had received orders from <span class="populated place">Auch</span> to come and pick me up but if they come and they find me ill, so ill that I cannot be transported, then they will leave me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: That's what they told her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="896">They told her that. </sentence><sentence id="897">So, they induced a fever in me and I'm always asked, how do you do that and they took some French bread and made balls out of it, like meatballs and soaked them in vinegar and I had to swallow about eight or nine of these vinegar soaked bread balls and sure enough within a half an hour or forty-five minutes, I was in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> with a high fever and when the police came, they took my temperature and they verified and certified that yes, he is not fit to be transported. </sentence><sentence id="898">So, that saved me that night or that day. </sentence><sentence id="899">The gendarme came back on two or three other occasions and each time the same thing was played. </sentence><sentence id="900">The same act was laid out. </sentence><sentence id="901">During that time period... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="910">Do you think that they, <span class="country">Germany</span> or the Germans called for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: This was a good Frenchman, okay. </sentence><sentence id="922">There were some decent people there and some people who felt that it was not right to round up children. </sentence><sentence id="923">This is 1942 so I'm now thirteen, okay. </sentence><sentence id="924">They didn't like to do that kind of a dirty job. </sentence><sentence id="925">Une Sale Corvee, a dirty deal, a dirty job we have to do. </sentence><sentence id="926">So, they protected me in that fashion if you will. </sentence><sentence id="927">During that time period, Mrs. Cavaillon was in touch again with the Quakers and I'm sure that her <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> probably got some support or some money from the Quakers also so that she knew whom to contact and through the Quakers I believe she then learned that's where my parents had been sent to. </sentence><sentence id="928">They were first sent to <span class="populated place">Vernet</span>, a placed called <span class="populated place">Camp du Vernet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="929">It was somewhere in the south of <span class="country">France</span> which was an <span class="populated place">assembly camp</span> and then the next postcard, I think a postcard came actually to the <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> from my parents advising that they were being sent to <span class="region">Paris region</span>, to the <span class="populated place">Drancy camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="930">The nine days came and went. </sentence><sentence id="931">My parents didn't return. </sentence><sentence id="932">I started to have some doubts about catechism and all other faith. </sentence><sentence id="933">I raised a lot  1 of questions and strangely enough the priest told me to go and talk to the archbishop, a thirteen year old. </sentence><sentence id="934">It's only today that I realize that this was most unusual that they would do this. </sentence><sentence id="935">Normally, a thirteen year old doesn't go talk to an archbishop and I vented my doubts and frustration and questions and he basically said to me, he said, well there is no answer to these questions. </sentence><sentence id="936">This is where faith comes in, you must either believe or you don't. </sentence><sentence id="937">But there is no explanation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="957">A: I had a lot of questions about how can God, how can Jesus allow these things to happen? </sentence><sentence id="958">What have my parents ever done to deserve this? </sentence><sentence id="959">What have I done and if I'm being punished, what is the punishment for? </sentence><sentence id="960">I also started to ask some fundamental questions, okay, if God created the <span class="env feature">world</span>, who created God? </sentence><sentence id="961">If there was nothing, than he couldn't have been here. </sentence><sentence id="962">How is this possible? </sentence><sentence id="963">So, basically I turned my back to religion at this point and I haven't come back to it yet, maybe on my <span class="spatial object">death bed</span> but for the time being, I don't feel the need for it. </sentence><sentence id="964">Now came the question, where do we go from here? </sentence><sentence id="965">There was one bit of information that was received from <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> saying that they left <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> for a destination unknown and about this time, we were now moving into, this was late August that they were arrested, I think it was August the 24" or 224 somewhere around that time. </sentence><sentence id="966">Now we are moving into September and <span class="building">school</span> starts up again. </sentence><sentence id="967">The <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> can't remain open, what to do with young Peter Feigl and Mrs. Cavaillon came back one day and announced to me that the Quakers are organizing a <span class="spatial object">children transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="968">Children that would be going to the <span class="country">United States</span> and there would be two <span class="spatial object">ships</span>, the first one will leave around the middle of November and the second one about the end of November or early December, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="969">Ultimately, Mrs. Cavaillon arranged for me to go to <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="970">In fact, she took me there. </sentence><sentence id="971">In my diaries, there are entries also about a trip to <span class="populated place">Toulouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">There must have been an <span class="building">American Consulate</span> or something where I went, I was questioned there and I underwent a physical exam to make sure that I didn't carry TB or whatever to infect <span class="country">America</span> and there were forms to fill out and sign. </sentence><sentence id="973">Ultimately, I wound up in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> somewhere around either the end of October or very early in November. </sentence><sentence id="974">The <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was scheduled to leave, the first <span class="spatial object">ship</span> I was told I'd be on the first <span class="spatial object">convoy</span> and it was supposed to leave somewhere around the 20" of November. </sentence><sentence id="975">On the 10" or 12" of November, the Allies landed in <span class="region">North Africa</span> and this gave the Germans the pretext to invade the so-called <span class="region">free zone</span> of <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="region">Vichy zone</span> of <span class="country">France</span> and the <span class="dlf">port</span> was closed and no <span class="spatial object">ship</span> leaves. </sentence><sentence id="976">So, now the people looking after us scrambled to find a place where to house us and I wound up in a small <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="977">There must have been about 15 or 20 of us outside of <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> in a place called <span class="populated place">Les Caillols</span> and we were more or less prisoners in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="978">The people who had taken us in obviously, again hadn't been prepared to have us there. </sentence><sentence id="979">I, in a typical kids fashion said, I'm going to get something to eat, and I found out that  2 the Germans had established a, there was a Waffen SS detachment that occupied the <span class="dlf">farm</span> across the <span class="dlf">road</span> from us. </sentence><sentence id="980">So, I said, I'll talk German and I'll get some food out of these guys. </sentence><sentence id="981">I'll get chocolate and what have you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1025">A: Well, I wound up in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> or <span class="building">home</span> which was run by a Belgian man and woman, in fact I think in my diary I noted that they got married while we were there but they were sort of the then mother and father if you will, looking after us. </sentence><sentence id="1026">The food was very difficult to come by at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1027">I'm sure in part this was due to the fact that they hadn't anticipated taking 15 or 20 kids and with the Germans occupying all of <span class="country">France</span>, what little food there was, was number one the Germans take priority on all food supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1028">When I found out and noticed that across the <span class="dlf">street</span> there was a <span class="building">farmhouse</span> there and the detachment of Waffen SS had moved in with their <span class="spatial object">armored personnel carriers</span> and so forth, I said, well I speak German fluently, I'm just going to go over there and chat up the Germans and I'm sure I'll get some chocolate or something out of them and I'll be able to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So, I went across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and sure enough I chatted them up and I guess my first contact they didn't ask me any questions and then I came upon a German captain there and the captain said, what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1030">What's a German boy doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1031">I don't know whether this is something I had learned from my mother but I said to him, shhh, you mustn't talk to anybody about this, this is very secret what I'm doing here. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I mean, here I'm thirteen years old, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1033">He said, well where are your parents? </sentence><sentence id="1034">I said, oh, my father is in the <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1035">He's in the secret police and we came to <span class="country">France</span> on a so-called business assignment and my father has been spying on the French for several years and I go to <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="building">French school</span> which is why I also speak French fluently and my <span class="building">French school</span> mates don't know that I'm spying on them. </sentence><sentence id="1036">So, I wasn't asked any more questions by the German captain after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: Did he believe you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: He believed me. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Either they believed me or he was scared, what if it's true and my father really is in the <span class="building">Gestapo</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1053">Maybe they could get into trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1054">I was very well fed and I got to eat spaghetti and I got chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="1055">No complaints at all until about three or four days later when the director of the <span class="building">home</span> where I was suddenly found out that I had been across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and he then proceeded to ship me out in a hurry because he was worried that I was endangering the other kids there. </sentence><sentence id="1056">But again, I was thirteen and I think of number one and I didn't really realize that I could possibly endanger anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="1057">So, although my protestations, I was shipped to another place and I think after a number of days, after the lesson had sunk in, then they took me back at <span class="populated place">Les Caillols</span>, where I had been before. </sentence><sentence id="1058"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: Could you connect for me, what happened with your parents with those soldiers or was it just something separate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1069">A: They were something completely separate to me. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I just didn't connect it. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I just didn't connect it. </sentence><sentence id="1072">At this point, I had been without news from my parents for now a couple of months, two and a half months, and I was being moved around from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="1073">There was a lot of discussion about what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Actually, the first discussions about my going to a <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="region">Department of Haute Loire</span> in the massive central had come up already. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Oh, well, I think while I was still in <span class="populated place">Condon</span>, before my parents were arrested, there was already some discussion there whether to send me to a <span class="building">school</span> that was in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Then, now in late November, early December, this became a more pressing question for the people looking after me and the decision was taken, to move me to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon Sur Lignon</span>, but it was too dangerous to move me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The <span class="dlf">roads</span> were being watched by the Germans and by the police. </sentence><sentence id="1078">There were all kinds of passes, identity paper controls and so forth and the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were being watched so it was decided to move me over the New Years holiday, over Christmas New Years, that there would be a relaxation of surveillance and I think it was on New Years Eve or on New Years Day that I was actually moved from <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon Sur Lignon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1079">According to my diary, I think I got there at about 2 o'clock in the morning or something like that and was met by a man named Daniel Trocme". </sentence><sentence id="1080">He was the cousin, I believe, or the nephew, I'm not sure, as I explained earlier about relations of the pastor of the <span class="populated place">village</span>, Andre Trocme", and we had a long long walk in a cold night and wound up finally in a <span class="building">house</span>, in an old stone <span class="building">house</span> called Les <span class="building">Grillons</span>, which was a <span class="building">bed and breakfast-type house</span>, okay, a pension, as they call it in French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1093">Q: Now was he at the <span class="building">train station</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1095">A: He met me at the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Yes, he met me and picked me up at the <span class="building">train station</span> but from the <span class="building">train station</span> to <span class="populated place">Les Grillons</span> was a good four or five kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I mean, it was a long hike, up the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> too, up the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1098">So, I now find myself in this <span class="building">home</span> together with about 15 or so kids in this <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Daniel Trocme" was our shepherd who looked after us. </sentence><sentence id="1100">He was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late twenties. </sentence><sentence id="1101">He looked after us and the entire <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire <span class="populated place">village</span> apparently was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that <span class="populated place">village</span> are about 90-percent Protestants, fundamentalist and people who, as they put it, lived the Bible, lived by the Bible and their pastor gave them the needed inspiration on the day that <span class="country">France</span> fell and surrendered to the Germans by telling his congregation that it is the responsibility of every Christian to resist the occupier with the weapons of the spirit and that's where  5 subsequently the title of a film about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> came from, Weapons of the Spirit. </sentence><sentence id="1102">That <span class="populated place">village</span> has a total population of about five thousand people during the period of about three years, actually hid and saved five thousand people, almost on a one-on- one basis. </sentence><sentence id="1103">These villagers never asked who you were or whether you were Jewish or not or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1104">They took you in. </sentence><sentence id="1105">They fed you. </sentence><sentence id="1106">You never had a situation of people saying, well, I wish I could help you but we don't have an empty <span class="spatial object">bed</span> or no, they opened up their <span class="dlf">doors</span> and they shared what little they had. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I always liked to, when I tell about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> to Americans, I try to make them understand that <span class="populated place">European farm villages</span>, the <span class="populated place">farming community</span> is quite different from the American one in that the people of the <span class="populated place">village</span> live clustered, very close together, one <span class="building">house</span> next to the other, there's no big <span class="dlf">yard</span>, no <span class="region">acreage</span> between them. </sentence><sentence id="1108">The people look across the <span class="dlf">street</span>, a narrow <span class="dlf">street</span> usually, and if they see the lights going out in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> across the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they know perfectly well it is ten past nine and they know that they count in twenty seconds a light will go on on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span> on the third <span class="dlf">window</span> from the right and that's the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and the light will be on for three minutes and thirty seconds and then the light will go out so you know exactly what your neighbor is doing. </sentence><sentence id="1109">You know his routine. </sentence><sentence id="1110">You can't escape it. </sentence><sentence id="1111">During that period, lights went on and <span class="interior space">rooms</span> where lights were never on at night and lights stayed on in <span class="interior space">rooms</span> way past the normal times and nobody ever reported this to the police, nobody ever betrayed anybody and that's truly remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And you must understand that the people did this, this did so knowing fully well that if the police were to find out, they wouldn't just arrest the person that they were hiding but they were subject to arrest as well as the entire family and their children. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Confiscation of their <span class="dlf">property</span>, of their goods and deportation to <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1114">So, what these people did, they did it at the risk of their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="1115">So, I was hidden there for about ten months. </sentence><sentence id="1116">During that period, they also saw to it that our education was not completely neglected. </sentence><sentence id="1117">There was a <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="building">Le College Cevenol</span>, which had been created as a <span class="building">private school</span> before the war and they saw to it that we went to <span class="building">school</span> every day and that we get on with our education. </sentence><sentence id="1118">It usually meant long hikes from the <span class="building">house</span> where we lived down to the <span class="building">school</span> and on the way back, we usually came back up with supplies in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1119">It was difficult to get shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1120">For example, Daniel Trocme" would scrounge worn out old tires and he would cut up the old tires and make soles for sandals out of them and by putting <span class="dlf">holes</span> into the tires and stringing rope through them, he would make sandals out of them. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Something that is very fashionable these days, I see a lot of kids walking around with these black sandals. </sentence><sentence id="1122">It was a rugged place. </sentence><sentence id="1123">It was at about an elevation of about three thousand feet. </sentence><sentence id="1124">The winters were very very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Lots of snow. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Most of us had frostbite on the hands, on the fingers and on our toes. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Partly because our clothing wasn't really that adequate but it also had a lot to do with the fact that our food was inadequate. </sentence><sentence id="1128">There wasn't enough fat content in the food and most of us were deficient in a number of nutrients and so forth but just about everybody was frostbitten fingers or toes. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Durith that  6 period, there was an organization there, individuals who specialized in forging papers and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1165">Q: Local citizens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1167">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Some of the local citizens, some of them were part of the group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1169">In other words, either the people that they took in were not just children, they were also adults, some husbands and wives, there was even a German deserter from the German army that they had taken in. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I had befriended him because he spoke German fluently so we would speak German together. </sentence><sentence id="1171">He was a, I remember as very tall, pale looking, very soft-spoken, gentle type guy who must have been eighteen or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1172">He deserted them. </sentence><sentence id="1173">He decided to <span class="env feature">desert</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Anyhow, in order to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for other people in need, there was a full <span class="dlf">underground railroad</span>, if you will, operating and if they could pass somebody as a Frenchman, and send them out of the <span class="populated place">village</span> to some other safe place, safe <span class="building">house</span>, if you will, then they would do so because then they would have more <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> to take on more new people that might be in need and since I spoke French fluently without the trace of an accent, ultimately I was given some French identity papers, false name, forged ration tickets, coupons that you had to have at the time and so forth and I was sent to a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Figeac</span> in the <span class="region">lot department</span> as a boarding student, it was <span class="building">high school</span> and <span class="building">boarding school</span> students in <span class="country">France</span> during that time were quite numerous and common almost in every <span class="building">high school</span> because you couldn't commute, there were no <span class="spatial object">school buses</span> so anyone who lived let's say five miles or more away from <span class="building">school</span>, the parents would just have the child boarded in <span class="building">school</span> at least for the week, if not for the entire semester. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So, I lived as a boarding student in <span class="populated place">Figeac</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1185">Q: Before we leave <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, I would like for you to talk about that ten months that you were there, what was the <span class="building">school</span>, but what was your daily life like, with the other people, who were the other young people that were with you, what were you aware of in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, did you have a sense of <span class="populated place">town</span> mood, people were there from other places, or did you just think it was your group of people, tell me about what it was like to live there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1187">A: They tried to keep us busy first of all. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Now during the <span class="building">school</span> months, between walking to <span class="building">school</span>, coming back with supplies, doing your homework, by the time you were finished, it was time to go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and get ready for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Our stay occasionally would be interrupted, our activities would be interrupted by suddenly someone saying, ah, we're going to go into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> for a hike and at the time, I didn't know the reason why and this is something that I found out later on, periodically the police would tip off people in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, and tell them we're coming up there at 10 o'clock to round up or look for Jews or look for people that are  7 hidden up in your <span class="populated place">village</span>, get them out. </sentence><sentence id="1190">So, they didn't tell us the reason, they just told us, we're going to go and pick mushrooms in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> or if it wasn't mushrooms season or we're going to go for a nature hike, a little walk and sometimes we would stay in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> for six hours, eight hours or something like that and then we would come back to the <span class="building">house</span> and everything was fine and dandy. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1192">During the summer months, there was a lot of hiking, a lot of tug of wars and games that were organized, occasionally, we would be visited by Pastor Trocme", Daniel's relative. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The Pastor was the inspiration and leader of this <span class="populated place">village</span> and the groups in the <span class="building">house</span> in which I was, was a very mixed group, there were boys and there were girls. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Among them were some Spanish refugees still, children of Spanish parents, of Spanish origin whose parents obviously had fled Franco, <span class="country">Spain</span> during or after the revolution and found themselves in <span class="country">France</span> and were either orphans or were persecuted for one reason or other. </sentence><sentence id="1195">There were some people from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1196">There were some German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1197">There was a young Frenchman who I am sure was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1198">He may have been an orphan. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I think he was an orphan. </sentence><sentence id="1200">He became a very very good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1201">He died of TB up there. </sentence><sentence id="1202">We were very close friends. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So, it was a mix of people. </sentence><sentence id="1204">There was an Italian woman who was the cook, who cooked for us and she had a daughter there also. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Her daughter was there. </sentence><sentence id="1206">I really don't know why they were there, what the reason was. </sentence><sentence id="1207">But, as I said, it was a very mixed group of nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="1208">I collected a lot of photographs which I kept and practically all of these photographs were passport-type pictures that were taken by the people who were creating these false documents, these forged documents for us. </sentence><sentence id="1209">But, they gave us an extra supply of pictures and when we learned that we might have to leave, we would start exchanging photographs and give a souvenir to our best friend by dedicating the photograph to him or her and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1210">I was able to take a lot of these photographs with me which I shouldn't have but we'll talk about that later maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1211">But day flowed into day, occasionally I would inquire whether anything had been heard from my parents and by now, I think I came to the realization that there was a program afoot in <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span> and so forth to deport Jews, deport them to <span class="country">Poland</span> or east to <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1212">The name <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I hadn't heard of it yet and so as time went on, let's say that my hopes faded too and I just kept on. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I was of course cut off from any other relatives at this point. </sentence><sentence id="1214">I had no idea whether my grandmother, uncle and aunt had made it to the <span class="country">United States</span> and if they did, I wouldn't know where or how to contact them. </sentence><sentence id="1215">I had some relatives in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I had mentioned Kleczewer earlier who was the managing director of the <span class="building">German automobile factory</span> there in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1217">I knew that they had

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1253">A: It may sound stupid, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1254">But, I had a good time. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Okay, I mean, there wasn't that much food but we had buddies, friends. </sentence><sentence id="1256">We could go out explore things in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, pick mushrooms, pick blueberries, pick wild strawberries, we could run down to the <span class="env feature">brook</span> and bath in the <span class="env feature">brook</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1257">There were as a matter of fact, there were also some boy scout activities going on and for the life of me I cannot remember but it was brought back to me when someone a few years ago suddenly produced a photograph of a group of Jewish scouts, okay and I'm right in the middle in the front row of them and the moment I saw the picture, I recognized myself, I knew what I was wearing, okay, the clothes and I remember posing for it but to this day, it's blocked out, I don't know exactly how I got there or what the occasion was but I know it was me. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I mean, I know I was in there. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So, that's a mystery to me but as I said, I never really felt that I personally was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I always went, at the time and to this very day, my wife can tell you that too, it drives her up the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, but maybe those war years taught me to be this but I don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I don't worry about things that I cannot control. </sentence><sentence id="1262">If somebody is going to come and arrest me, what can I do about it?Worrying about it isn't going to make them go away. </sentence><sentence id="1263">So, until it happens, I go on with life and I do what I want to do or what needs to be done and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1264">As the Italians say, Que. </sentence><sentence id="1265">sera sera, what will be will be, but don't worry about things that you cannot control and I think that was my attitude even later on as I fled across the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span> and we were being shot and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I mean, I , you get hit you get hit - - worry about it then, but until then . . . </sentence><sentence id="1267">As I said, it may be stupid, but I think that it has helped me a great deal in remaining sane, keeping my sanity and keeping my wits about it. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I just don't go to pieces. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1308">A: I met Andre Trocme"", well first of all Andre Trocme" came and visited at <span class="populated place">Les Grillons</span> on several occasions. </sentence><sentence id="1309">At that time, again, I certainly was not aware of what a splendid individual this man was and he was just one of the older people who were looking after us. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I met Mrs. Trocme" about ten years ago or so after the war when I went to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> and so she appears in that movie I mentioned, Weapons of the Spirit, and so, but the Trocme" family is remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Daniel Trocme" by the way is one of the very very few people that was arrested by the Germans and sent to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and killed because the Germans simply could not believe that an Arian, a non-Jew would do what Daniel had done and so he is one of the very few people that was arrested in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> and died. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Andre Trocme" was also arrested together with the principal of the <span class="building">school</span>, someone named Theis and they were locked up for thirty days until for some reason the Germans released them after thirty days. </sentence><sentence id="1313">They came back to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> and continued their good deeds, their good work. </sentence><sentence id="1314">It's a fascinating . . . </sentence><sentence id="1315">that <span class="populated place">village</span> is truly a fascinating story. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the French Protestants of course, had been severely persecuted back in the 15th century and these were descendants of the original French Protestants, the Huguenots they are called. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Many Huguenots fled to <span class="country">America</span> to what later became the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">But the French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and the ancestors of the people of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> managed to clamber up on this <span class="env feature">mountainous plateau</span> and it was the beginning of the winter and the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Nobody can live up there anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1320">But they survived and in their <span class="building">church</span> services and in their, what do they call it, they have a song that they sing which is sort of reminiscing or singing about their origin and their past suffering and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Whenever they get together, they like to sing that song. </sentence><sentence id="1322">It's like an anthem or a hymn to them, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="1323">It mentions, it talks about teaching the children about the past, the need to teach them, to let them know what their forefathers went through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1340">Q: Were you aware of any of that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: Well, I think I fell in love with a couple of girls but I don't think that I had any, I mean, I never expressed my love and there was no kissing or hand holding or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1355">I think I was considered much too young at the time and so I never... I just think that this was my first love, you know, but there was never any physical contact or a relationship there. </sentence><sentence id="1356">I think we were all pretty young and pretty square in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1357">You just didn't do those sort of things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: But it was a group of people that pretty much stayed together the whole time you were there, the ten months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1364">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1366">Q: So you knew these people pretty well by then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1368">A: Yes, but even there, even in a small group like this, the people tended to form clicks, groups and the age range also was quite broad. </sentence><sentence id="1369">I think the youngest one in our group was probably ten or eleven and the oldest must have been sixteen or seventeen so although an age difference of four or five years, let's say may not be much when you're fifty, sixty or seventy. </sentence><sentence id="1370">When you're a teenager, one year of age difference or two years, that's like a generation apart and so you had on the one hand the older kids that would stick together with the older kids and then you had a further breakdown of people gravitating to one another by language group. </sentence><sentence id="1371">The Czechs, okay, there were three or four of them that were Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Well they would get together and speak Czech. </sentence><sentence id="1373">There were three or four German origin and they would get together and speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1374">The Spaniards and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1375">So you had these clans of groups that would form. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I was a loner. </sentence><sentence id="1377">I really didn't click with any group and this French boy, Amede Dutoit was his name, he was even more of a loner than I was than I was and I think that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously. </sentence><sentence id="1378">But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably brought up to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> because they thought that the <span class="env feature">mountain air</span> would be good for him and in those days people with TB were sent to <span class="building">sanatoria</span> in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and so forth and so that's probably what brought him up there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1390">Q: How were you to find out that you were to leave there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1392">A: I think that my being sent away came in conjunction with Daniel Trocme's arrest. </sentence><sentence id="1393">I think when the German's arrested Daniel Trocme"", a) there was nobody else to take over at that point and they had to disperse the kids and I think b) they also were concerned that since Daniel was in charge of <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>, anyone at <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>  1 might be easy prey and I think the decisions must have made, I'm assuming here, that we better disperse these kids and close down <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1394">I think <span class="building">Les Grillons</span> supported, if not totally financed, it was supported by the Quakers. </sentence><sentence id="1395">The Quakers had very close ties with Pastor Trocme". </sentence><sentence id="1396"><span class="building">Trocme</span>"", before the war, had been a pacifist and draft resistant. </sentence><sentence id="1397">He refused to serve in the French armed forces and urged other people to refuse to serve in the military and that's one of the reasons why they assigned him to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, which was a forlorn, God-forsaken place up there and they figured he wouldn't get headlines as he was getting in whatever <span class="populated place">parish</span> he had before. </sentence><sentence id="1398">That he was in a larger <span class="populated place">city</span> and the Protestants felt that his vociferous and noisy speeches about draft resisting and so forth are not helping their cause. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So they assigned him to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon parish</span> and got him away from the headlines from the journalist and then he became the moral leader of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1400">He never told people what they had to do. </sentence><sentence id="1401">He never told them you must hide people or you must take them in and there were, this is another one of the puzzling and remarkable things. </sentence><sentence id="1402">It wasn't managed where somebody says, okay, we're sending this guy here and that guy there and the next five who come in are going there, no, this was all spontaneous. </sentence><sentence id="1403">The people just knew what they had to do and did it. </sentence><sentence id="1404">In his sermons on Sunday, went back to the old testament to fundamentalist ideas and concepts. </sentence><sentence id="1405">If someone is sick, you go and visit them. </sentence><sentence id="1406">If someone is hungry, you give them something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1407">If someone is homeless, you provide them with a <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">So, that was basically what drove these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: Do you remember seeing Germans in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: I remember seeing Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1429">I know that there were some German soldiers who came on convalescent leave so it was sort of a R &amp; R rest and recuperation place and I don't remember how many but there have been about forty or fifty or so who occupied one or two <span class="building">buildings</span> there and if I remember correctly, they had all been wounded on the <span class="region">Russian front</span> and so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want to have trouble with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1430">They pretty much kept to themselves and some historians who have looked into the past, into the history of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, think that that may also be one of the reasons why there was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1431">These soldiers had gone through hell on the <span class="region">Russian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1432">They didn't want to start hunting Jews or anybody else, just leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Everyday that I can stay away from duty on the front somewhere, so much the better. </sentence><sentence id="1434">So, I had no trouble. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1442">Q: Did you ever go to the place where they were making all the false documents? </sentence><sentence id="1443">Did you see the operation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1446">A: Not that I know of. </sentence><sentence id="1447">No. </sentence><sentence id="1448"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1452">Q: They provided you with what you needed to leave there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1454">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Basically, the false names, the false identities that they gave us generally were the first name would start with the same letter as your real first name. </sentence><sentence id="1456">The last name would start with the same letter that your real name was. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Your birth date would remain the same. </sentence><sentence id="1458">The place of your birth would be changed so that they would drill into what's your name? </sentence><sentence id="1459">Okay, and make sure that you don't come up with your real name but that you come up with your new identity. </sentence><sentence id="1460">That, however, if your initials or if you were to start writing, you would naturally start writing the first letter of your first name P and hopefully by then you realize that it's not Peter or Pierre but it's Paul, okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1468">Q: Who did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1470">A: Apparently, according, from the film, the Weapons of the Spirit, there was a particular individual was quite adapt at producing and forging documents at creating official stamps and so forth and he apparently was the primary individual who did this. </sentence><sentence id="1471">But he must have had help, that's true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1474">Q: Do you remember someone coming to you and telling you what your new name was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1476">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I remember being given a new identity and the papers and they were making sure that I understood that I was born in <span class="populated place">Luca</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, okay, the last place of <span class="building">residence</span> was with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1478">I was born in <span class="populated place">Auch</span> but my birth date was still the 1" of March, 1929, and they took me through this repeatedly and made sure that somebody asked me what my name is, that's what it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1482">Q: Did they come to the place you were living and did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: Yes, at <span class="populated place">Les Grillons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1485">But, again, I mean, some of these things, you know, later on when I went to <span class="populated place">Figeac</span>, I was going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I had to take German, a mandatory course and I was first in <span class="building">class</span> and I was correcting the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="1487">The teacher's German was atrocious. </sentence><sentence id="1488">Of course, in retrospect, it was stupid of me, okay, but it never occurred to me at time and to this day I still have a copy of my <span class="building">school</span> transcript in my report card and the German teacher wrote down in the comments, very good student but must be careful not to fall asleep on very easily gained laurels or very easily acquired laurels. </sentence><sentence id="1489">He knew perfectly well that German had to have been my mother's language, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1490">I mean, that must have been obvious to him. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So, I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1492"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: You left <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> in the winter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1504">A: I left <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, I think it must have been in December of 1943 or January of 1944, so I had about ten months in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> and in <span class="populated place">Figeac</span> at the <span class="building">school</span> there, the <span class="building">College Champollion</span>, there were, I think, three or four other kids who had also come from <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="1505">I think two of them I knew from <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Two of them was in the same <span class="building">house</span> as I was. </sentence><sentence id="1507">Another one, the other two came from another <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1508">So, again, here you have a situation where undoubtedly the principal or whoever was in charge of that <span class="building">public school</span> knew perfectly well that he was accepting some students of questionable background but they also protected us. </sentence><sentence id="1509">The interesting thing about the Figeac episode is that I became involved at that point in resistance activities. </sentence><sentence id="1510">The Germans used the <span class="interior space">schoolyard</span> as a <span class="dlf">parking lot</span> and at night a couple of other guys and I, we would scrape together whatever sugar we could find in the <span class="building">cafeteria</span>, in the <span class="building">canteen</span> and so on and we would pour it in the <span class="spatial object">gas tanks</span> of the <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span> and the next morning, we just loved to watch them try to get the <span class="spatial object">engines</span> started and started, and if they stayed in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> long enough, and after about fifteen minutes or so of idling, all of sudden the <span class="spatial object">engine</span> stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1511">The <span class="spatial object">engine</span> was all gummed up. </sentence><sentence id="1512">We enjoyed it even more when this happened and then they drove out of the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> right away and we knew that about a half a mile down the <span class="dlf">road</span>, they're going to get stuck. </sentence><sentence id="1513">We would slash their tires and force them to change wheels and so forth on the <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Somehow the Germans didn't enjoy this very much and they started to play pretty rough in <span class="building">school</span> and started to round some of the kids up and so forth and some of the teachers must have been in contact with the Maquis of the French underground and I was called out a few times to help them with translation, translating German letters or documents that they found. </sentence><sentence id="1515">At a certain point also, the Maquis attacked the only major <span class="building">factory</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span>, which was a <span class="building">propeller factory</span> making propellers for <span class="spatial object">German fighter planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1516">The Allies had tried to bomb that <span class="building">factory</span> repeatedly and they could never succeed because it was geographically in a very awkward location. </sentence><sentence id="1517">It was in an elbow of a <span class="env feature">river</span>, a bend of a <span class="env feature">river</span> and there were <span class="env feature">mountains</span> on both sides so they couldn't attack it by dive bombing and they could only try to hit it from high altitude and they never could and it was a critical <span class="building">factory</span> because it was the only <span class="building">research factory</span> in the world at that time that were producing those kind of variable pitch propellers. </sentence><sentence id="1518">So, the Maquis was asked to go and blow it up and I tagged along with the group the night that they went into the <span class="building">factory</span> and I think it was ten or eleven plastic explosive charges that they planted on the equipment used to make those <span class="spatial object">propellers</span> and destroy it. </sentence><sentence id="1519">Shortly after that the Germans then came into <span class="populated place">town</span> and rounded up all the male citizens between the ages of sixteen and fifty-four, I believe it was, and shipped them off to a <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1520">Now, I happen to have learned just last summer that because I went to a commemoration of a round up in <span class="populated place">Figeac</span> last summer, I found out that the division that came and rounded up everybody in <span class="populated place">Figeac</span>, it was the same division that two  4 weeks later destroyed the <span class="populated place">town</span> of, I can't think of the name of it, a <span class="dlf">mental block</span>, anyhow it will come back to me, they rounded up all the people, shot them and of the people that survived, they were mostly woman and children and babies. </sentence><sentence id="1521">They were bundled off into the <span class="building">church</span> of the <span class="populated place">village</span> and they then set the <span class="building">church</span> on fire and then burned them alive and three or four of them tried to escape through the <span class="dlf">window</span> and they were shot as they tried to come out. </sentence><sentence id="1522">It was <span class="populated place">Oradour</span>, <span class="populated place">Oradour Sur Olane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Okay, and it was 638 people who were killed and massacred there.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1616">Q: Now what happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1618">A: Well after that, when the dust settled, I came back down and now it becomes a jumble. </sentence><sentence id="1619">There's an organization named Haias and the UJF, which was a French- Jewish organization, and again the Quakers, there were a number of refugee assistance organizations whose names I kept hearing and someone visited me then in the <span class="building">school</span> and told me that I was to get ready, that I may have to leave, they didn't say where yet. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Then I think, the departure date was set for me about three or four days later and it was cancelled and then it was postponed to another day. </sentence><sentence id="1621">Ultimately, I was given a railway ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1622">I was told to pack a <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> and to only carry what I could put into the <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> to sew my birth certificate and the Baptismal certificate in the lining of my <span class="spatial object">jacket</span> that I had and told to go to the <span class="building">railway station</span>, take a specific <span class="spatial object">train</span> and get off at a specific <span class="building">station</span> and that there someone would approach me and they would tell me what to do next and that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1623">I took the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, got off at a small stop somewhere near the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>, it turned out, right near the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>, was approached by a young man about 25 or 30 years old or something like that who told me to follow him and he was a, what the French call a passeur. </sentence><sentence id="1624">A boarder passer. </sentence><sentence id="1625">Usually they did it for money. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Maybe this guy did it out of personal conviction, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Normally the passeur, you hired them to guide you and help you finally spot with little risk of crossing the <span class="dlf">border</span> illegally. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1646">Q: ... it has been sent there, you have new papers, you have a new identity -- what's your new name? </sentence><sentence id="1647">What is your new name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1650">A: Under the false name that I had been using? </sentence><sentence id="1651">It was <span class="populated place">Fesson</span>, <span class="building">Pierre Fesson</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And it's with, with the identity, with that false identity that I traveled with in <span class="country">France</span>, with my birth certificate, with my real name, and baptismal certificate, which was basically a stamp on the back of my birth certificate, sewn in the lining of my jacket. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And I had been instructed that when I get to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> to produce the real papers. </sentence><sentence id="1654">So the name of the <span class="building">train station</span> I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1655">It's in my <span class="spatial object">diary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1656">I wrote it down. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And last summer, in 1994, my wife and I, in fact went to that place, to that very same <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And the <span class="building">railroad station</span> is still there. </sentence><sentence id="1659">It looks still the way it did at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And I retraced the <span class="dlf">steps</span> leading towards the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1661">Anyhow, at that time in, we are now in May of 1944, about two weeks or so before the Normandy landings, late May, 1944 there were other people on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, there were kids on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, in the same <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that I was in. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And they somehow failed to get off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> at the <span class="building">station</span> that we were told to get off. </sentence><sentence id="1663">So problem number one was that I got off, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I wasn't going to tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I had no way of knowing whether they were told to get off at the same <span class="building">station</span>, or another <span class="building">station</span>, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1666">But the first thing that the <span class="spatial object">passeau</span>, after he identified me, said to me, he said, "These stupid kids failed to get off at their <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1667">We have to wait until they get off at the next <span class="building">station</span> in order that they're brought back here." </sentence><sentence id="1668">So ultimately, we were rejoined by these other kids. </sentence><sentence id="1669">It was a couple of hours or so later. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And there were, we were about ten or eleven all told. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And he marched us first through open <span class="dlf">fields</span>, then through <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1672">It was drizzling. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1696">Q: Did you have, were you taken from the <span class="building">train station</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1698">A: From the <span class="building">train station</span>, right. </sentence><sentence id="1699">It was drizzling, the <span class="env feature">ground</span> was wet. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And he explained to us that he was going to walk us to within a couple 100 feet or so of the <span class="dlf">Swiss border</span>, that once we're there, that spot, that he would designate we are to lie down on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and we should wait until the changing of the guards, and the changing of the guards would be, we could tell because we will hear whistles blowing and chances are we will hear some dogs barking and there will be some commands exchanged, but when they change, when the guard change takes place then you go straight from the <span class="dlf">barbed-wire fence</span>, climb up over the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and when you're on the other side you come down and you are not in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, you are in what is called the "<span class="region">no man's land</span>", so don't stop, continue. </sentence><sentence id="1701">Go across the "no man's land" to the second row of <span class="dlf">barbed-wire fences</span>, then up that <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Once you're there, then your safe and you're in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1703">So he disappeared, he left us there. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And as I said, it was cold, it was wet, it was drizzling, we were just freezing  7 and waiting there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1712">Q: Were you hiding in the <span class="spatial object">stall</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1714">A: We were lying in the, on the <span class="env feature">grass</span>, on the, whatever was on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> of the, on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> of the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, pine needles, brushes, and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1716">Q: There were <span class="env feature">trees</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1718">A: There were <span class="env feature">trees</span>, yes, lots of <span class="env feature">trees</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And we could see the, you could just make out the <span class="dlf">border</span>, the <span class="dlf">barbed-wire fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1720">And periodically we could see soldiers walking in one direction or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And so around 1:00 o'clock, I think, afternoon, activity, the whistles, could hear some dogs barking, we said, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And we jumped up, and we started to head for the <span class="dlf">barbed-wire fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1723">I upped first friends into "<span class="region">no man's land</span>". </sentence><sentence id="1724">Half way through the "<span class="dlf">no man's land</span>" I hear people screaming, I hear some shots ring out. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I don't stop, I keep going to the second <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and I go up. </sentence><sentence id="1726">Just about to start the second <span class="dlf">fence</span>, I see this outline, this silhouette of a soldier standing there wearing a <span class="dlf">field</span>, field-green, field-gray uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1727">My first reaction was, it's a German. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And then I looked again and I said, no. </sentence><sentence id="1729">The, his helmet looked different and he was carrying his rifle in a fashion I had never seen a German carry a rifle. </sentence><sentence id="1730">This man was cradling the <span class="spatial object">rifle</span> in his arms like a baby. </sentence><sentence id="1731">So I, up on the second <span class="dlf">fence</span> and over it and he was motionless until I was on the other side and touched the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1732">Then he just motioned to me and said, "Get behind the <span class="building">building</span>," in French. </sentence><sentence id="1733">There was a <span class="building">building</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And now I knew I was in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1735">Well, apparently, what had happened is that some of the other kids, one a girl, got over the first <span class="dlf">fence</span> and she saw the soldier who I had seen, and she thought it was a German. </sentence><sentence id="1736">So she thought she had made a wrong turn, or something was wrong, and she began to scream, "The Germans are there, the Germans are there," and she turned around to head back to where she had come. </sentence><sentence id="1737">She became totally disoriented. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And two other people, equally confused, didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And during that period, the Germans started to open fire. </sentence><sentence id="1740">So, I think, out of a group of about 10 people, seven of us, we made it across. </sentence><sentence id="1741">I have no way of knowing what happened to the other three. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And once we were all safely behind the <span class="building">building</span>, then the Swiss soldier went inside, picked up his <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, called, and we waited there and a <span class="spatial object">Swiss Army truck</span> came out about a half of an hour later, loaded us onto the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and took us to a refugee <span class="building">center</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And I remember the <span class="dlf">drive</span> into <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1744">There were <span class="building">grocery stores</span> and so forth, and they had displays on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> outside the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And I saw things I hadn't seen in four years, things called bananas and oranges and, I mean those, we didn't know, we had forgotten what they were practically because those are grown in <span class="region">tropical areas</span> and during the war years they just didn't come into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1746">And so I was in <span class="populated place">Schlaraffenland</span>, which is what you call it in German. </sentence><sentence id="1747">It was, you know, the  8 land of milk and honey all of a sudden. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And we, we were interrogated by the Swiss authorities and they were going to ship us back. </sentence><sentence id="1749">But during my interrogation, I pointed out that my father had had business friends, business contacts in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and I remembered the name of one family, and I gave the name and told them, "I remember the name of the <span class="building">company</span> in <span class="populated place">Bern</span>," and I gave them the name of the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1750">So they contacted that <span class="building">firm</span> apparently. </sentence><sentence id="1751">And the family said, "Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1752">We know Mr. Feigl." </sentence><sentence id="1753">So they decided to take me in. </sentence><sentence id="1754">So that enabled me to stay in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So I was given refugee status in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and was sent to <span class="populated place">Bern</span>, stayed with that family, they sent me to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1756">I was undisciplined at the time, created problems in <span class="building">school</span>, was disruptive. </sentence><sentence id="1757">After a year the <span class="building">school</span> wanted to get rid of me. </sentence><sentence id="1758">With the <span class="building">school</span> wanting to get rid, get me out, expel me, the family had had enough of me, they didn't want me anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1759">So I was turned over to the <span class="building">Swiss Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1760">They placed me in a <span class="building">children's home</span> for about two months until they found another place for me. </sentence><sentence id="1761">I was sent to another <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> called <span class="building">Ecole D'Humanite</span>", which was another <span class="building">school</span> that was run by a saintly man who had studied in <span class="country">India</span> and was a friend of Rabin Pra Nath Tagore, a famous Indian philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="1762">He tried to apply some of his learnings, what he had learned in <span class="country">India</span>, to the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Again, I was being rebellious. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I wouldn't comply with the rules. </sentence><sentence id="1765">So after three months I got thrown out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I was then sent to <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> to a <span class="building">Ort school</span> where they would teach me some mechanical trade. </sentence><sentence id="1767">They found a Catholic family to, with whom I could live in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1768">And after 60 days they couldn't take me anymore and they begged the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> to get me out of their <span class="building">home</span> and find some other place for me. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I then wound up in a <span class="populated place">children's camp</span>, there were about 40 of us living in this large <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And I, during that period I was going to the <span class="building">Ort school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And this is also the period during which, I guess when I was still in <span class="populated place">Bern</span> in 1945 probably, or 1944, late 1944, early 1945, I first was able to reestablish contact with my relatives through the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1772">They had been searching for me and for my parents through the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1773">And so I think I first heard from my relatives in <span class="country">England</span>, the <span class="building">Kleczewers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And shortly after that I heard from my relatives in the <span class="country">United States</span>, from my grandmother, my uncle, and my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And they then told me that they would enable me to get a visa to come and join then in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And ultimately, in 1946, in July of 1946, I did make it to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1777">My uncle in <span class="country">England</span> insisted that I pay for my own ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Since I couldn't pay for it, he advanced the money. </sentence><sentence id="1779">But I had to sign a promissory note to reimburse him for the cost of the ticket, the voucher and the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> fare, which I repaid. </sentence><sentence id="1780">And I arrived in the <span class="country">United States</span> in July of 1946 with the same backpack that I had when I crossed the <span class="dlf">border</span> and I had seven dollars on me and a change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1781">And my English, basically, consisted of "The <span class="dlf">door</span> is open," "The <span class="dlf">window</span> is shut," "John is a boy," "Mary is a girl," with a heavy French accent. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1856">A: I think it was just rebelliousness, it was just that, I'm now free, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1857">And you can't tell me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1858">What do you mean I'm not allowed to take a girl into the <span class="spatial object">rowboat</span> on the <span class="env feature">lake</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1859">And I'm not allowed to smoke here? </sentence><sentence id="1860">You don't know what I've gone through. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I've been smoking for years, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1862">You're going to tell me not to smoke?.Another <span class="building">house</span> rule was you don't drink water during a meal. </sentence><sentence id="1863">You only drink after a meal. </sentence><sentence id="1864">That was part of the Indian teaching, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1865">You eat your fresh fruit, you start the meal with fresh fruit, when the stomach is empty and absorbs the greatest amount of minerals, and vitamins, and so forth, and extract them from the fresh fruit and, well, that's not for me, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1866">I eat my apple whenever I want to, and I would make a great display of getting up in the middle of the meal and going out into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and coming back with a glass of water. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And I would take a girl out on the <span class="spatial object">rowboat</span> on the <span class="env feature">lake</span> alone, and smoke a cigarette with her in the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1868">So I, he just put up with it for so long. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And then, ultimately, he said, "This is too much. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Get rid of him." </sentence><sentence id="1871">That was a very interesting <span class="building">school</span>, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1872">It was <span class="building">school</span> that was created by this man, Paulus Geheeb. </sentence><sentence id="1873">He was a German. </sentence><sentence id="1874">He started the <span class="building">school</span> in the 1920s, a very liberal <span class="building">school</span>, unstructured basically, let the children learn as quickly as they are able to absorb it, let them spend more time on the subjects that are of more interest to them, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And he started the <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1876">It was called the <span class="building">Oden Waldschule</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And when Hitler came to power Geheeb immediately felt that such a <span class="building">liberal school</span> would not be tolerated in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1878">So he packed up his <span class="building">school</span>, he was, he was Aryan, he was Christian, packed up his <span class="building">school</span> and established it in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And many German, many children of German leaders were sent for their education to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And when the war started, Paulus Geheeb decided that 50 percent of his students would be destitute, refugee children who he was going to take in. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And he also further decided that the parents of the other children would have to pay the tuition for the destitute children. </sentence><sentence id="1882">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> there with the, I think they were the children of the, or the nephews of Field Marshall Von Brachitz, a German general. </sentence><sentence id="1883">He had two of his sons there. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And they were in that <span class="building">school</span> together with Swiss children from wealthy families and other kids like myself, Jewish refugees, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1885">So we got along quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1886">It's just that I just wasn't ready to, to settle down at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And there's no question I was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1888">And in some ways, I am still very difficult today. </sentence></p></dialogue>

over from <span class="populated place">Figeac</span> with the false name on it. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And the <span class="building">Board of Regents</span> said, well, before we can give him credit for anything that he studied in <span class="country">Europe</span> he must first pass a test of four years of American history and nine years of English. </sentence><sentence id="1947">It was absolutely out of the question. </sentence><sentence id="1948">I mean, I knew nothing about American history and my English was atrocious. </sentence><sentence id="1949">I couldn't have passed a two-year English test at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So my relatives then wanted me to continue either with the <span class="building">school</span> work or learn a mechanical trade, or any kind of a manual trade. </sentence><sentence id="1951">That was part of the <span class="spatial object">refugee baggage</span>, if you can call it that. </sentence><sentence id="1952">By now, everyone had, everyone had learned that when you arrive in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> they would ask you what your occupation was, what your trade was. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And if you were a tailor, or if you were a sheet metal worker, or a mechanic, they put you to work. </sentence><sentence id="1954">If you were an intellectual you went to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1955">So they wanted to make sure that for the next time that this happens that I would be prepared and I would be among those who would be selected to work. </sentence><sentence id="1956">I didn't want that either. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I, because I wanted to earn money. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I wanted to have my own money and buy things, meet girls, take them out for a milkshake or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And so against their advice I got my first job in downtown <span class="populated place">New York</span> in a dye and tool making place, based on my experience and the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And they hired me as a, as a apprentice machinist. </sentence><sentence id="1961">I objected in my lousy English at the time and said, "I do the same work as the man next to me. </sentence><sentence id="1962">Why am I being paid as an apprentice, and he's getting full union wages?". </sentence><sentence id="1963">And so he promised me a raise. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And I waited for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And when the raise didn't come, oh, he, after six weeks he finally decided, okay, here's your raise. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And it was five cents an hour. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And I asked him, I said, "Is that my raise?". </sentence><sentence id="1968">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1969">I said, "Forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I don't want this job." </sentence><sentence id="1971">And I took my coveralls off and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1972">And again, my relatives were very upset about this. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And I said, "Oh, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1974">I'll find another job." </sentence><sentence id="1975">And  1 three days later, I had a job at <span class="populated place">Montgomery Ward</span> as a mail clerk. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I was earning 10 cents an hour more than I was getting at <span class="building">machine tool shop</span>, and it was a white collar job. </sentence><sentence id="1977">I didn't get my fingers dirty, and I didn't come <span class="building">home</span> with metal filings in my, in my skin, and that launched me on a white collar career. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And from then on, I waited until I was 18, and on my is" birthday I decided to join the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And I wanted to be a pilot. </sentence><sentence id="1980">Remember when they were being attacked and shot at by <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> and <span class="spatial object">German dive bombers</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1981">I wanted to be a pilot. </sentence><sentence id="1982">So I went into the <span class="building">Air Force</span> and, once I was in, learned belatedly that since I was not a citizen I could not become a pilot. </sentence><sentence id="1983">Because to be a pilot you had to be an officer. </sentence><sentence id="1984">To be an officer you have to be a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1985">So I was stuck in the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1986">And I was given the opportunity to go to any <span class="building">Air Force school</span> that I wanted to, except cryptographer. </sentence><sentence id="1987">Because, again, I wasn't a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And to get into cryptography, code breaking or code making, you had to, you had to be a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1989">So I picked three <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And after I finished my basic training everybody lined up and received their assignments to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And I said, "Hey, Sarge, how about me? </sentence><sentence id="1992">You didn't call my name." </sentence><sentence id="1993">He said, "Oh, you're a lucky bastard. </sentence><sentence id="1994">You don't have to go to <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1995">So I was sent to <span class="building">Air Technical Intelligence</span> at <span class="populated place">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span> because I spoke French and German fluently, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1996">So I became a translator. </sentence><sentence id="1997">And that really was the blessing in because I had a lot of time. </sentence><sentence id="1998">I spent three years translating or abstracting captured German documents that covered every branch of science you can imagine, from propellants to <span class="building">oil refineries</span> to aerodynamics, meteorology, and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1999">And with each new document I had the time to go to the <span class="building">library</span>, immerse myself in the vocabulary and the language of the <span class="dlf">field</span> and I learned a lot that way. </sentence><sentence id="2000">I mean, a lot of it rubbed off. </sentence><sentence id="2001">And after three years in the Air Force I came out and had a difficult time at first finding a job, this is now 1950, and ultimately got a job with <span class="building">American Express Company</span> as a translator at a ridiculous $35 a week. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But I had a policy. </sentence><sentence id="2003">My policy is as soon as you have a job in hand immediately start looking for a better job. </sentence><sentence id="2004">And Ino sooner starting working at <span class="building">American Express</span> than I was looking at ten, twelve different other places trying to get another job. </sentence><sentence id="2005">And six weeks after I started with American Express I get a response to one of my job applications to do the same work I was doing in the Air Force for a civilian contractor back in <span class="building">Wright Field</span> paying me $75 a week, going from $35 to $75 a week. </sentence><sentence id="2006">That was pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="2007">So I moved to, back to <span class="populated place">Dayton</span>, <span class="region">Ohio</span>, in 1950. </sentence><sentence id="2008">And I did that for about two years. </sentence><sentence id="2009">I warned my boss at the time that he wasn't looking after the <span class="building">business</span> properly, that he's going to lose the contract. </sentence><sentence id="2010">That is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And the day it happened, we were driving back into <span class="populated place">town</span> and I saw a sign that said, "Your <span class="populated place">City</span> needs policemen." </sentence><sentence id="2012">So now, I'll become a cop, and took the Civil Service Test and wound up at the top of the list, and in spite of the fact that I was six pounds underweight they decided that because of my good test scores they will take me. </sentence><sentence id="2013">So I became a cop for a year. </sentence><sentence id="2014">I saw a lot of things that I didn't like there. </sentence><sentence id="2015">First of all, they put me on the <span class="building">Vice Squad</span> because I was unknown and I was a fairly handsome kid. </sentence><sentence id="2016">So they thought that they'll  2 use him to entrap people and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2017">And I saw a lot of things going on in the <span class="building">Police Department</span> that I didn't like. </sentence><sentence id="2018">I mean, this was a time, this was in 1952.Most of the policemen in those days had a ninth grade education. </sentence><sentence id="2019">They were dishonest, they were drunkards, a lot of, that was too much for me to stomach. </sentence><sentence id="2020">And after eleven months I had a run-in with my captain, police captain, and he told me, "You don't make arrests in this place, you stay out of that place, and leave these people alone." </sentence><sentence id="2021">I said, "Hey, wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2022">I took an oath to enforce the law equally, no matter who it is." </sentence><sentence id="2023">And if I did make an arrest, he would destroy my evidence so I had no case when it came to <span class="building">Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2024">And I finally said, "The hell with this. </sentence><sentence id="2025">I don't need this. </sentence><sentence id="2026">I quit." </sentence><sentence id="2027">And I became, my next job was as a, what is called an assistant manager for a <span class="building">personal finance corporation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2028">That's a small <span class="building">loan company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2029">The assistant manager really is a collector, people who don't pay their loans. </sentence><sentence id="2030">Well, I did that for about three months and I couldn't stomach waiting for people to come <span class="building">home</span> with their paycheck and squeezing five bucks, or two bucks or what have you out of them. </sentence><sentence id="2031">So I was looking for something else at the time and managed to get myself a job with <span class="building">Chrysler Aiv-Temp</span> as an assistant engineer. </sentence><sentence id="2032">And don't ask me how I wound up as an assistant engineer and made now twice what I was making on the <span class="building">Police Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2033">About this time, the Chief of Police called me and said, won't I please come back? </sentence><sentence id="2034">If I read the paper tomorrow, I'll find that captain whatever his name is has decided that his health isn't so good, he's going to <span class="region">Florida</span> to retire. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And I said, "Thank very much, Chief. </sentence><sentence id="2036">But I'm now making twice what I was making before. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And I'm not working swing shifts. </sentence><sentence id="2038">I'm working on a regular schedule. </sentence><sentence id="2039">Thank you very much." </sentence><sentence id="2040">And then I got together with a fellow who I worked with as a contracted translator. </sentence><sentence id="2041">And we decided to try to get the contract ourselves, form a <span class="building">company</span> and see if we couldn't get contract, the translation contract. </sentence><sentence id="2042">So I found an organization, an existing corporation in <span class="populated place">Newark</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, and convinced them that they should back us financially. </sentence><sentence id="2043">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="2044">And they established a subsidiary. </sentence><sentence id="2045">And I became the general manager of the subsidiary. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And I was now making $100 a week. </sentence><sentence id="2047">And we got the contract. </sentence><sentence id="2048">The <span class="building">Air Force</span> felt that they had been pressured in giving us the contract, and they killed us with kindness. </sentence><sentence id="2049">After one year the thing collapsed and I went looking for another job. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And I decided that there is no future in the <span class="building">translation business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2051">I got to get out of this. </sentence><sentence id="2052">So finally, I got a job with <span class="building">Curtiss-Wright</span>, which was an aircraft engine manufacturer at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2053">And I became, what the heck was it, I guess it was a, I know, engineer, engineering, a spare parts engineering liaison department, and it was analyzing engineering change orders. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Anyhow, I told them that I was prepared to take a pay cut if they'll give me a chance, watch what I'm doing and if in six months I am performing as expected then I would expect them to raise my money back to my salary, back to what I was earlier earning before, if not I'll leave and forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="2055">And four months later, they raised my salary back to the $100 a week and promoted me. </sentence><sentence id="2056">So everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="2057">I was with them for about four years, meantime looking for another job. </sentence><sentence id="2058"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2192">Q: Let me ask you a question here. </sentence><sentence id="2193">Clearly you made rapid success . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2196">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2198">Q: ... in <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2200">A: Can't complain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2202">Q: You did. </sentence><sentence id="2203">And I mean, you had confidence . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2206">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: ... sounds like. </sentence><sentence id="2209">You had your, always had your eye on something better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2212">A: Better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: What does that have to do with your experience growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2216">A: I think all I can say is that the war years had taught me to stand on my own two legs. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And I think my mother probably gave me some inspiration too, stand up for your rights. </sentence><sentence id="2218">She used to have a motto, "Wenn man dir gibt, nimm. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Wenn man dir nimmt, schrei," which means, translated it means, if someone is giving you something, take it. </sentence><sentence id="2220">If someone tries to take something away from you, holler. </sentence><sentence id="2221">So, but I think, basically I think I had become self-reliant long before and realized if I don't do it, it's not going to get done. </sentence><sentence id="2222">And I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I mean, my wife keeps reminding me that luck plays some part in it too, possibly. </sentence><sentence id="2224">Looks probably also has something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="2225">I had more hair in the past. </sentence><sentence id="2226">And I was tall, which also helps generally when people hire. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Apparently, subconsciously, they tend to gravitate towards a taller person, projects more authority or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2228">And so at <span class="building">Curtiss-Wright</span> I next was offered a job with an aviation export company in downtown <span class="populated place">Manhattan</span>, <span class="populated place">downtown New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2229">And they needed a technical director, oh in the meantime I had paid, out of my own pocket, I had paid for pilot lessons and I had learned to fly. </sentence><sentence id="2230">I had gotten my pilot's license. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And the technical director was also supposed to be responsible for <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> sales and he had to have a pilot's license. </sentence><sentence id="2232">So they offered me the job. </sentence><sentence id="2233">I spoke French, German. </sentence><sentence id="2234">It was all international marketing. </sentence><sentence id="2235">When I told <span class="building">Curtiss-Wright</span> I was leaving, they made, they asked me how much I had been offered by the company in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I told them. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And they said, we will match it and add $1,000 to it. </sentence><sentence id="2237">We want you to stay. </sentence><sentence id="2238">I went back to the man in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and I said, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2239">You won't believe this. </sentence><sentence id="2240">But they just matched your offer and added another $1,000 a year to it. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And he said, "Look, I want you." </sentence><sentence id="2242">If you promise that you will come to work for  4 me I will match what <span class="building">Curtiss-Wright</span> has offered you and add another $1,000." </sentence><sentence id="2243">I said, "You got me." </sentence><sentence id="2244">So I left <span class="populated place">Curtiss-Wright</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2245">I spent the next four years with <span class="building">Aviquipo</span>, a company in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2246">And during that time, again, I was looking out for something better to do and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2247">This, by the way, this job involved a tremendous amount of traveling overseas where I got to use my languages and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2248">I traveled all over world selling <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> and ground support equipment for <span class="spatial object">jetliners</span> that were then coming onto the scene. </sentence><sentence id="2249">And finally I was offered a job as a director of international marketing for, by a <span class="building">helicopter manufacturer</span> up in <span class="region">Connecticut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And he offered to pay me 50 percent more than what I was getting in the previous job. </sentence><sentence id="2251">So that didn't take long, and I accepted. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And fortunately, I had a wife who went along with this. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And it wasn't easy for her, moving place to place. </sentence><sentence id="2254">But, so we moved to <span class="region">Connecticut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And I was there for three years. </sentence><sentence id="2256">And after three years of traveling all over the world again I came to the conclusion that this manufacturer, <span class="building">Comman Aircraft</span> (ph), wasn't ever going to sell another <span class="spatial object">helicopter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2257">So I went, I talked to the president of the <span class="building">company</span> and I told Charlie Comman, I said, "I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2258">But as I see it now I don't think you have a Chinaman's chance of selling another <span class="spatial object">helicopter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2259">You might as well take the money you spend on international marketing and flush it down the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2260">It'll have the same effect." </sentence><sentence id="2261">He said, "Well, I appreciate your candor. </sentence><sentence id="2262">But you're telling me I don't need you anymore." </sentence><sentence id="2263">And I said, "Well, I hope that maybe you can use me on the <span class="region">domestic side</span> or something." </sentence><sentence id="2264">He said, "Well, I'll keep you on the <span class="spatial object">payroll</span> until you have another job." </sentence><sentence id="2265">So I went to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2266">Of course, we're selling <span class="spatial object">helicopters</span>, <span class="spatial object">military helicopters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2267">There were contacts in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2268">And I called up an Air Force colonel I had been dealing with to find out whether the Air Force had succeeded in, it was <span class="country">Iraq</span>'s, getting the Iraqis to buy our <span class="spatial object">helicopters</span>, and he said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="2269">And he said, "What else are you doing in <span class="populated place">town</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="2270">I said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I'm looking for a job. </sentence><sentence id="2271">But I don't know how to go about it." </sentence><sentence id="2272">I said, "I figured that with my knowledge of languages and the traveling I've done, there must be something I can do, either in the <span class="building">commerce department</span> as a commercial counselor at an <span class="building">embassy</span> or in the <span class="building">State Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2273">What, how do you go about it?". </sentence><sentence id="2274">And he said, "Would you consider working for the <span class="building">Defense Department</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="2275">I said, "<span class="building">Defense Department</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2276">Doing what?". </sentence><sentence id="2277">And he said, "Well, we have a <span class="building">GS15</span> opening." </sentence><sentence id="2278">And I said, "What's a <span class="building">GS15</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="2279">He said, "Oh, that's the equivalent of a full <span class="building">Coronal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2280">I said, "That still doesn't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="2281">Money. </sentence><sentence id="2282">How much does it pay?" </sentence><sentence id="2283">He said, "Oh, it's about $14,200." </sentence><sentence id="2284">And this is 1963 now. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And I said, "Well, that's a little less than what I'm making now. </sentence><sentence id="2286">But I'm at a <span class="dlf">dead end</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2287">So, yes, I'm interested." </sentence><sentence id="2288">So he said, "Well, I'll set up an interview for you." </sentence><sentence id="2289">So the next day I was interviewed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And after an hour of interview he said, "Welcome aboard." </sentence><sentence id="2291">So I went to work for the <span class="building">Defense Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2292">And I stayed there, well until all of my clearances and everything had come through, by the way, I was told, "Welcome aboard," the day before Kennedy was assassinated, and it was on the next day that I was flying back <span class="building">home</span> to  5 <span class="region">Connecticut</span> when I heard Kennedy was shot and my first thought was oh shoot. </sentence><sentence id="2293">There goes the job. </sentence><sentence id="2294">But no, I was kept. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And I, we moved to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, my wife and two daughters in February of 1964. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2376">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="2377">This was now almost 20 years .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2382">Q: ... the past, almost, which is less. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Did you have any way at that time of even knowing what had happened to your parents and where you came from. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2386">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2388">Q: ... trying to find out all this time. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2390">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2391">The, through the <span class="building">International Red Cross</span> I had learned back in the, I think it was the late 1940s, that the assumption is that they were transported from <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2392">The German .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2396">Q: You found that out when you accomplished the <span class="country">States</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2398">A: No, I, yes, I think I was already in the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2399">In the 1950s I applied for, the Germans had a program for restitution. </sentence><sentence id="2400">And for the restitution program the Germans, or someone had to establish a death date, the date of death for my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And the German Government arbitrarily declared that they died in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> on May 8th, 1945, which was the last day of the war, the date of war. </sentence><sentence id="2402">But I didn't really find out what happened until about three and a half years ago, four years ago, when I was living, when I moved to <span class="region">Florida</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2403">And we became friends with a French couple. </sentence><sentence id="2404">Well, he's French. </sentence><sentence id="2405">His wife is <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And he had been hidden in <span class="country">France</span> during the war years by a Frenchwoman. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And he had accumulated a lot of information about the war years and what happened to Jews during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And he showed me a book which the Klarsfelds had put together, which was list of every <span class="spatial object">convoy</span> that left <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and I went through it and I found my parents" names in there. </sentence><sentence id="2409">So I know that they left <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> on a <span class="spatial object">convoy</span> on September 2nd, 1942, and they arrived September 4th at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And according to the record there of the 1,000 people, I think all but 60-some were immediately gassed. </sentence><sentence id="2411">So I'm sure that my parents were in one of those that, died on September 4th. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2430">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2431">It would have been a month after, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2432">So, but that's in the record. </sentence><sentence id="2433">I mean the  6 Germans are very orderly and they kept detailed lists with every name, place of birth, date of birth and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2438">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2439">Have you been to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2442">A: No, [have not yet been. </sentence><sentence id="2443">I do want to go. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And I'd expect I'll be going, probably next year I'd like to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2448">Q: Do you have children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2450">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2451">We have two daughters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2454">Q: And have you told a lot about your experience to them or to other people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: I guess I have told them, and I'm sure my wife has also told them never, I don't think, in a chronological order as we have just done it here during this interview. </sentence><sentence id="2457">How much my children have remembered I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2458">How much they can put together and sort out chronologically I don't know either. </sentence><sentence id="2459">If there is one thing that I've learned, I discovered what is meant by "generation gap." </sentence><sentence id="2460">And just as I could not understand what my father was talking about when he was talking to a nine, or a ten, or an eleven-year-old and retelling his exploits on an <span class="spatial object">Austrian submarine</span> on the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>, that when he was in military service and he's Admiral Horthy, what's an Admiral, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2461">I mean, it didn't mean anything to me. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And I would hear the stories time and time again. </sentence><sentence id="2463">And I guess, subconsciously, I was saying to myself, here the old man goes again telling me about his stupid <span class="spatial object">submarine</span>, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2464">So I realized that, you haven't lived it. </sentence><sentence id="2465">It's very, very hard to identify with it, to become involved in it, to get emotionally involved in something. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And the best example I have there is that with all the food shortages and so forth that I've experienced in my life it goes against my grain when I see people leaving food on a <span class="spatial object">plate</span>, which is also why I'm getting fat, because I've got to finish what's on the <span class="spatial object">plate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2467">And if there is some left in the <span class="spatial object">pot</span> that has to be eaten too because you can't throw it away. </sentence><sentence id="2468">And so we used to tell the children, "Eat the food on your <span class="spatial object">plate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2469">There are people starving in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2470">There are people hungry in <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2471">There are people hungry here and there." </sentence><sentence id="2472">And then one day I realized, how on earth can we expect the children to know what hunger is when after every dinner they have a very important decision to make: Do I now eat two scoops of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate ice cream or should it be two scoops of chocolate and one of them vanilla? </sentence><sentence id="2473">So it's totally unreasonable to try to expect the other generation to understand this. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Now, perhaps as they get older, our children are now, the oldest one just turned 38 and the younger one is 34. </sentence><sentence id="2475">They're four years apart. </sentence><sentence id="2476">Maybe, as they get older, they might reflect and think back about where their parents were, what they did, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2477">I did find, last summer, when we were in  7 <span class="country">Austria</span> I found the grave of my grandmother, my father's mother, and of his father. </sentence><sentence id="2478">And I had it restored. </sentence><sentence id="2479">So, but that's also something that I wouldn't have given a second thought to 20 years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2504">Q: Why now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2506">A: I guess it's, my days are numbered I guess. </sentence><sentence id="2507">And if someday our children do want to know where do they, where are their roots, where do they come from, there's something for them to go to. </sentence><sentence id="2508">I mean, fortunately, there's nothing for them in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2512">Q: Your grandmother lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2514">A: She lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2516">Q: And your aunt and uncle? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2518">A: They also lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2519">They just lived five <span class="dlf">blocks</span> apart. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And my grandmother, who must have been in her 70s, she had to eke out a living of sorts too. </sentence><sentence id="2521">So she ran a <span class="building">bridge club</span> in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And everyday people came to play <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2523">She served tea and cookies and so forth and charged them so much, the setups and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2524">I had to pay her half of what I was earning for rent. </sentence><sentence id="2525">I lived with her for the first seven, eight months that I was in the <span class="country">States</span> until I went into the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2526">And so I paid her half of what I was earning for <span class="interior space">room</span> and <span class="spatial object">board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And I also had to repay my uncle in <span class="country">England</span> for the fare to come to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And I started with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2529">But, little by little, especially after I got married, we worked our way up, my wife and I.We first, well, she first started to move into my <span class="interior space">bachelor apartment</span> which was a one- room <span class="interior space">studio apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Greenwich Village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2530">And I was already living in style at that time because that was expensive real estate. </sentence><sentence id="2531">I mean, and, but it was a furnished place and there was one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2532">And from there we moved to <span class="populated place">Newark</span>, closer to where my new <span class="building">business</span> was, the <span class="building">company</span> that I helped set up. </sentence><sentence id="2533">And we lived in a furnished <span class="interior space">apartment</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And then we moved into an unfurnished <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to another place in <span class="region">New Jersey</span> and bought our first stick of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2535">And then we bought our first <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And little by little, we got there. </sentence><sentence id="2537">Of course, very often, it was tough, especially tough for my wife. </sentence><sentence id="2538">Because each time I would uproot her and the kids, if we moved from, we lived outside of <span class="populated place">Princeton</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2539">I used to commute every day into <span class="populated place">Manhattan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2540">That was a long commute. </sentence><sentence id="2541">But we couldn't afford anything nice nearer <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2542">So when I then got a job in <span class="populated place">Connecticut</span>, of course, it meant uprooting and moving to <span class="populated place">Connecticut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2543">When I got a job in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, first we came down here, lived in <span class="populated place">Alexandria</span> in an <span class="building">apartment building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2544">Then we moved closer to the <span class="building">Pentagon</span> in <span class="populated place">Arlington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2545">I was putting in very long hours, Saturdays and Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And  8 I decided I didn't want to be more than a mile away from the <span class="building">Pentagon</span>, which was very selfish on my part. </sentence><sentence id="2547">But the family went ahead and moved again. </sentence><sentence id="2548">And then, subsequently, we did buy a <span class="spatial object">townhouse</span> in <span class="populated place">Arlington</span> less than six miles away from the <span class="building">Pentagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2549">And I could shoot down there in 10 minutes time. </sentence><sentence id="2550">So that's, and really, the <span class="region">Washington, D.C. area</span> is the <span class="region">area</span> where we lived longer than anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="2551">We lived here from 1964 until 1990. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2587">Q: I think we're coming close to the end. </sentence><sentence id="2588">And I would like for you to, I know it's maybe not even a fair question, but if you could summarize in some way how your, the first 17 years of life? </sentence><sentence id="2589">How you think of it now? </sentence><sentence id="2590">How do you, do you still have questions about it? </sentence><sentence id="2591">Are you still, do you still analyze it? </sentence><sentence id="2592">Do you still wonder what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="2593">Or do you, have you accepted it and moved on beyond it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: I have accepted it and moved on beyond it. </sentence><sentence id="2602">I mean, this goes back to what I told you earlier, that I consider it an act, some people may think it's a curse. </sentence><sentence id="2603">But it's an act that drives my wife up the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2604">The ability that, for instance, some of these <span class="building">companies</span> I've worked for, the company stood on the verge of bankruptcy, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2605">I would leave the <span class="building">office</span> on Friday, 5:30 p.m., and I would kind of switch up there in the brain and it was out of my mind and I wouldn't think about it again until the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="2606">Not while I was driving to work. </sentence><sentence id="2607">When I entered the <span class="building">office</span>, then the switch was turned on again and then I started to worry about the problem, what to do next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2615">Q: And that's what you've done with the first . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2617">A: And that's what I've been able to do, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2618">I just, unpleasant things, I just shun them aside and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2619">It may be good, it may be bad. </sentence><sentence id="2620">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2621">I haven't discussed it with a psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="2622">Every so often my wife says maybe I should go into analysis. </sentence><sentence id="2623">Then I say to her, "Well, if I do, and supposing I discover that I can't live with myself, what do I do then? </sentence><sentence id="2624">I'm quite happy now." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2633">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2634">Here's some stuff that came up. </sentence><sentence id="2635">Now what I'd like... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2639">A: We're looking at a postcard that was taken probably in the late 1930s of a <span class="building">house</span> which is marked <span class="building">Pension De Famille</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2640">It was a <span class="building">boarding house</span> or a <span class="building">bed and breakfast</span>, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And that <span class="building">house</span>, a solid <span class="building">house</span> built of <span class="env feature">rocks</span>, the <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>, the <span class="building">home</span> where I lived from the time that I arrived in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> in the beginning of 1943, until I left in late 1943, it was called <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And Daniel Trocme" was the den father, I guess you would call it, who looked after us in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2643">I've visited that <span class="building">house</span>, by the way, recently. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And not much has changed. </sentence><sentence id="2645">It looks pretty much the same as it was, including the <span class="dlf">water trough</span> that you see to the far right of the picture. </sentence><sentence id="2646">Here is a group shot taken in front of <span class="building">Les Grillons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2647">You can see the <span class="building">building</span> in the  9 back. </sentence><sentence id="2648">This is a picture probably of all the kids who were housed there. </sentence><sentence id="2649">You can see that there are some very young ones in the <span class="interior space">front row</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2650">One of them was the daughter of the cook. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And one of them, the little blonde girl in the front with the bow in her hair, she was a sister of the Czech boy who was there. </sentence><sentence id="2652">In the picture also, in the <span class="interior space">back row</span>, in the center, the man with the eye glasses, that is Daniel Trocme". </sentence><sentence id="2653">And to the left of Daniel Trocme", or to his right, you see another adult. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And that is pastor Theis, who was the assistant Pastor at the <span class="building">Protestant Church</span> in the <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2655">I am just barely visible. </sentence><sentence id="2656">My face is obscured by the shadows, the shadow cast by the <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2657">I'm just to the right of the person on the, the last person on the left there. </sentence><sentence id="2658">You can just barely make out my face. </sentence><sentence id="2659">Here is a page from my first diary. </sentence><sentence id="2660">This is a diary I'd begun the day I learned my parents had been arrested in <span class="populated place">Auch</span>, August, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="2661">The page that you're looking at on the right, it says, in German, <span class="populated place">Neu Johr</span>, New Year, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2662">Since I lived in <span class="country">France</span>, throughout my diary, there are notations in German, which I thought was a language that the French wouldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2663">So if I wanted to say something that I didn't want the French to know I would write it down in German. </sentence><sentence id="2664">The two photographs are of my mother and my father. </sentence><sentence id="2665">They are passport photographs. </sentence><sentence id="2666">I remember where they were taken. </sentence><sentence id="2667">They were with an amateur camera. </sentence><sentence id="2668">We couldn't afford to go to a photographer at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2669">And it was taken in our <span class="interior space">backyard</span> in <span class="populated place">Auch</span>, where my father kept his rabbits and chickens and a <span class="interior space">vegetable garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And they just sat in front of the, that <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2671">And those pictures were necessary to apply for all kinds of official documents, visa applications, travel documents, and so forth, which my parents never ceased to fill out and file for. </sentence><sentence id="2672">The original of this diary has been donated by me to the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2673">It's in the <span class="building">archives</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="2674">I also made one translation of the diary back in, I think it was in late 1978, 1979 or early 1980. </sentence><sentence id="2675">I also provided a copy of that translation to the <span class="building">Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2676">About 10 years later, I went through this diary a second time through a translation. </sentence><sentence id="2677">And I then remembered many abbreviations that I used that I, originally, couldn't decipher. </sentence><sentence id="2678">I didn't know what they meant. </sentence><sentence id="2679">But in the second translation which I made and which I have also given to the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> I have translated or explained what these abbreviations mean. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And also, throughout, I gave additional amplification or explanations in square brackets of things that might not be understood by a casual reader. </sentence><sentence id="2681">This is one of the photographs that was taken of me at <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2682">It's one of the passport pictures that was used by the document forgers to come with a false document, false identity papers and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2683">And as I mentioned I think before, we were all given copies of these photographs. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And whatever number of pictures we didn't actually use we then started to dedicate them to our friends and exchange them. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And that is how I came into possession of some 30-some photographs, these passport photographs, from the other people hidden at <span class="populated place">Les Grillon</span> in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2686">And my entire collection of these photographs I have also dedicated to the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2687">As you can see, I had a lot more hair then. </sentence><sentence id="2688">
