<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well, it's growing up in a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, you know, and what would come to my mind probably most, would be the fact that I was the youngest in the family, and my parents were Orthodox Jews, and my older siblings, my brothers and my sisters, were kind of paving the way for me, which, you know, getting our parents to accept certain things that normally they would not. </sentence><sentence id="32">So, in Yiddish they call it the <span class="spatial object">mizinik</span>, that means the -- the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="33">I was fortunate, and privileged as a result of this, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Well, not all of them. </sentence><sentence id="78">My oldest sister Esther did not. </sentence><sentence id="79">But bear in mind that this was a period that the -- the coming out of -- of Jewish, young Jewish people, coming out of the O-Orthodox confines, you know, and embracing the culture and -- and the type of living that was, you know, in the process of developing. </sentence><sentence id="80">It was in the process of developing. </sentence><sentence id="81">So, it -- it is difficult to say what was the year that a break point came. </sentence><sentence id="82">It was more you have to deal with it, you know, in periods, in that case, perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="83">But it was an interesting period, it was a period where the transition from straight Orthodoxy, and you know, no questions asked, to you know, this is the Jewish law, and this is the custom, and this is what you do, came under scrutiny by young people. </sentence><sentence id="84">Young people wanted to embrace, you know, the customs and, you know, culture of the <span class="country">country</span>, either that they lived in, or that was neighboring, you know, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: And did -- did this distress your parents, from what you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Yes, it did, because they felt that we are wandering off, and we will wind up in a different culture, an-and to them it was a very, very major problem, no question about it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did this -- did this mean that there was a kind of internal argument, in -- in the -- in the <span class="building">household</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: It was not only internal, it was -- it was -- our -- our parents did not take kindly to the fact that, for instance, my brother, my oldest brother, you know, he was not kosher. </sentence><sentence id="98">This was unheard of in those days, you know. </sentence><sentence id="99">My older sister, Esther, she was perhaps a little more progressive than my parents, but religious, and following the rules and customs, you know, that she was raised -- she was brought up in. </sentence><sentence id="100">My younger sister was -- Peshe was desiring to make progress, but was not quite that courageous. </sentence><sentence id="101">But Jonah, he was the fighter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="108">And were you -- were you modeling yourself off of [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: I was -- first of all, bear in mind that there was a difference between -- in my ye -- young -- my oldest -- my youngest sibling, and me, what there was a difference of 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, you know, it's a substantial difference. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I was the baby in the family, and -- you know, and -- and that's -- I pointed out to you the fact that I was the youngest, you know, everybody treated me with a little extra affection, and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I would say, when I look at it back, that my effort to embrace, you know, progress and, you know, and modern methods and -- and -- and stepping away from some of the Jewish laws was the most af -- most vivid. </sentence><sentence id="115">And my parents recognized it, and they tried, but they tried with me, not ano -- in the manner of laying down the law and no questions asked, but trying to persuade me, trying to do certain things, you know. </sentence><sentence id="116">But they realized that times are changing, and it will be a different world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Did you speak Polish and Yiddish in the <span class="building">house</span>, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="125"> A In the <span class="building">house</span>, Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: With my colleagues, Polish and Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: And did your parents speak Polish as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: They did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So when you grew up, were you growing up in a very mixed atmosphere, or because your parents were Orthodox Jews, it was very enclosed within the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: They were two processes of growing up. </sentence><sentence id="140">One was the growing up at <span class="building">home</span>, and the other one is the growing up at outside. </sentence><sentence id="141">At <span class="building">home</span> my parents were Orthodox Jews. </sentence><sentence id="142">My father was a -- a lieutenant of one of the famous rabbis of those days, the Belzai rabbi that you probably heard about it, you know, the Belzai rab -- the Belzai rabbi was one of the major, major, ra-rabbinic dynasties of those days, and my father was a lieutenant there. </sentence><sentence id="143">This was something very unusual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: And what does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: He was very close to the -- the rabbi, and when he ki -- first of all, he supported him substantially. </sentence><sentence id="152">And when he came to <span class="populated place">Beltz</span>, where the rabbi lived, is -- my father was called [indecipherable] Tomasheva, that was a big to-do. </sentence><sentence id="153">If the rabbi or his family, or his brother, who was the chief rabbi of <span class="populated place">Bilgori</span>, which was a neighboring <span class="populated place">city</span>, came to <span class="populated place">Tomashev</span>, they stayed in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">This is something extra, extra special. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Mm. </sentence><sentence id="160">So your father was a prominent person? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: And mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And mother. </sentence><sentence id="170">So tell me about him. </sentence><sentence id="171">What do you remember about your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Well, first of all, you'll have to bear in mind that we are dealing about a period where Jews were confined to their own <span class="dlf">cultural environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And my father, for in-- to give you an example, was very friendly with the township judge. </sentence><sentence id="177">But being friendly with the township judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my father invited the judge for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="178">But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th -- my father was very respected. </sentence><sentence id="179">As far as our material position in <span class="populated place">town</span>, I would say we were considered one of the wealthiest people, and this had it's impact also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: And your father was as a -- a business person? </sentence><sentence id="186">He ran a -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: My father, yes. </sentence><sentence id="190">My father concentrated on -- we -- we were <span class="building">millers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">And some <span class="building">mills</span> we owned, and some <span class="building">mills</span> we leased and operated. </sentence><sentence id="192">But we were <span class="building">millers</span> for generations, you know? </sentence><sentence id="193">And my mother was a very, very bright woman, very bright woman, very unusual woman, and she was running <span class="building">businesses</span> on her own. </sentence><sentence id="194">She had a wholesale import, and -- an import business of tea, and coffee, and -- and spices, and you know -- it was a very large business. </sentence><sentence id="195"><span class="interior space">L-Large</span> to an extent -- to give you it -- it's -- it will sound funny. </sentence><sentence id="196">When  salespeople came to <span class="populated place">town</span> -- it's going to be difficult to describe it for you in English, because in English the -- in Polish there is a difference between male and female when you refer to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="197">In English you don't -- who is Joan Ringleheim, who is Miles Lerman? </sentence><sentence id="198">But in Polish is, this is -- you know, defined in masculine, and in -- in -- in -- in </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: In feminine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: In feminine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: And salesmen used to come and ask who is this, but referring to it, you know, as a man, Jarket Lerman, you know. </sentence><sentence id="216">In other words, they couldn't believe that a <span class="building">business</span> of this magnitude, of this size, is run and operated by a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So how did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="220">It's so unusual, it would seem to me, during that era. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes, yeah, yes. </sentence><sentence id="224">You have to bear in mind that for women to be involved in -- in the p -- in -- in -- in the task of earning a living was not unusual in <span class="country">Poland</span>, because you have to understand that going back not too many years, not too many decades, it was the nicest thing. </sentence><sentence id="225">The best thing that could happen to a man is to sit and study Torah, and his wife was the breadwinner. </sentence><sentence id="226">But the breadwinner, she had a little stall, you know, and was selling a herring, or you know, or some flour, or some sugar, you know, and scraped out a living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: This is not what my mother did. </sentence><sentence id="234">My mother ran a very, very large <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And it was difficult for th -- [indecipherable] I told you, it was difficult for them to conceive that a woman is on this level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did she come from a family where they were business people as well, is this what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Well, y-yes, my grandfa -- I remember my grandfather on the ma -- on the <span class="region">maternal side</span>, he was at -- he had a -- he was mun -- he was in charge, he had -- I was gonna call it a <span class="building">factory</span>, it was not a <span class="building">factory</span>, it was a <span class="building">plant</span>, where they were making wooden shingles, because wooden shingles were used, you know, for <span class="dlf">roofs</span>, and this was th -- it's like having a -- a <span class="building">roofing business</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="242">So, yes, they came from a business family, but not of the size, and not of the caliber that my mother developed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: So the kids of the family, did they help in the milling business of your father? </sentence><sentence id="246">Didn't you help more with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: Depends. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Depends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: It depends. </sentence><sentence id="251">This was not the only <span class="building">business</span> we had. </sentence><sentence id="252">We had a wholesale business of liquor, which is, you know, this -- this -- you needed special license for it. </sentence><sentence id="253">So, my brother, for instance, when he was in <span class="populated place">Tomashev</span>, was in charge of the <span class="building">liquor business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">My sister Peshe and her husband were in charge helping mother with her business. </sentence><sentence id="255">My older sister, Esther, and her second husband -- because she lost her husband at a very early age, were in charge of helping father with the <span class="building">mills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">So everybody did something, you know, specifically, and mother and father were directing traffic, they were, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I -- I was in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">I was the youngest, you know, and my father died in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="268">Normal death, you know. </sentence><sentence id="269">When I say normal, it was not part of the Holocaust -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: -- it was 1938. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I came <span class="building">home</span>, and the family decided now because I wa -- I studied in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, you know, so the family decided that mother is going to need help, and you know, and there will be a reshuffling of who will do what, and they decided that I need to interrupt my schooling and stay <span class="building">home</span>, which I regret very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: So let me go back to when you were a kid. </sentence><sentence id="281">Were you a very spoiled kid? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: I'm surprised. </sentence><sentence id="297">Was it a little bit difficult at <span class="building">home</span> in some ways, being the youngest, because all your siblings were so much older? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: No, this was -- my being the youngest was a plus, because everybody felt that they -- you know, I'm the kid, the kid brother, and they need to be good to me, and they need to be good with me, and they need to play a role in, you know, in bringing me up, because bear in mind that mother is, you know, the impressive person she was in the world of business, she was an extremely religious woman. </sentence><sentence id="301">She bought a <span class="spatial object">shaitel</span>, you know what a <span class="spatial object">shaitel</span> is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
