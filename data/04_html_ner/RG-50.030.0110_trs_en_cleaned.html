<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: I was born, of course, uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Start with your name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is Carl--C-A-R-L--H. Kniiemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N. Kniiemann. </sentence><sentence id="10">And I was born in <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">Actually, the Germans called it <span class="populated place">Bromberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">A very difficult name to spell, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: In what year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Uh, 1922, 15th of November. </sentence><sentence id="20">And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932. </sentence><sentence id="21">And in November, we left <span class="country">Poland</span> because my father was German citizen and businessman. </sentence><sentence id="22">We had a small <span class="building">factory</span>--<span class="spatial object">bakery machinery</span> and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What was it like growing up? </sentence><sentence id="30">You can look at me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="34">In <span class="country">Poland</span>, actually, compared with <span class="country">Germany</span>, it was a free <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">I came to <span class="country">Germany</span> expecting a paradise. </sentence><sentence id="36">My parents had told me that it would be like this. </sentence><sentence id="37">But it turned out that life in <span class="country">Poland</span> was like living in a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="38">There was strike, there was economic hardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="39">Most of my friends were Polish boys from the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic minority and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="40">The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so, my friends came up to me and said, "Tomorrow!" </sentence><sentence id="41">It meant actually they were mad at me; but they never came with a knife and cut my throat. </sentence><sentence id="42">I didn't expect them to either, you know. </sentence><sentence id="43">They didn't expect to do that either. </sentence><sentence id="44">So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic problems. </sentence><sentence id="45">And you get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="46">And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not getting upset about it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="47">My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent, all three. </sentence><sentence id="48">The family came from <span class="country">Hungary</span> originally via <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">And Frederick the Great took these <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span> Germans into <span class="region">East Prussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">That's where my mother landed. </sentence><sentence id="51">And the family mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person. </sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is just...is not getting upset about anything. </sentence><sentence id="53">But already as a child I knew when a problem came up, she stepped right in and helped solving it. </sentence><sentence id="54">She never turned her back. </sentence><sentence id="55">My father same thing. </sentence><sentence id="56">I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="57">So it dropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal mistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem and make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it. </sentence><sentence id="58">So I was a happy child. </sentence><sentence id="59">My father was a hunter. </sentence><sentence id="60">He went fishing. </sentence><sentence id="61">He was socially quite active. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had parties our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">Being a businessman in <span class="country">Poland</span> meant actually that you had your clients invite at least once or twice a year. </sentence><sentence id="64">Once at least for a big hunt. </sentence><sentence id="65">Uh, that's why my  father really kept the <span class="dlf">hunting ground</span> to have a party opportunity to reward his customers. </sentence><sentence id="66">My father also became honorary consul of the German <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span>, so as a businessman...And he served in this function, I think, until "29 or so. </sentence><sentence id="67">And, of course, he knew about the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="68">Because of the <span class="building">foreign office</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already indicated that Hitler will take over very soon. </sentence><sentence id="69">So the message of doom, at least for my father, was quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="70">It didn't...it took one incident. </sentence><sentence id="71">My father was riding by <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="73">And another person came into his <span class="interior space">compartment</span>--a German who traveled to <span class="country">Germany</span>, too--and after the <span class="spatial object">train</span> started to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out, [the] Volkischer Beobachter. </sentence><sentence id="74">My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="75">He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man. </sentence><sentence id="76">He saw this, my father really angry. </sentence><sentence id="77">He took his <span class="spatial object">briefcase</span> from out of the <span class="spatial object">rack</span> and told this guy, "I don't want to share my <span class="interior space">compartment</span> with a man who reads the Nazi paper." </sentence><sentence id="78">That's what the kind of person my father was. </sentence><sentence id="79">Because he addressed the right person. </sentence><sentence id="80">This person was actually his replacement. </sentence><sentence id="81">You know, he was on a visit to <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span> to talk to my father how he would take this over, you know. </sentence><sentence id="82">And later on, a day or two later, he met him. </sentence><sentence id="83">This guy came visiting and said, "I am <span class="building">Consul</span> [Bernhard (ph)]."_ </sentence><sentence id="84">And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting; and my father was relieved of his position in a week's time. </sentence><sentence id="85">This guy had gone back to <span class="country">Germany</span> and wrote up the incident in the <span class="interior space">compartment</span>; and that really fixed my father's future for good. </sentence><sentence id="86">My father, of course, didn't need that job at all. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was really uh more bother than reward. </sentence><sentence id="88">He ran his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">But then the recession came and <span class="country">Poland</span> was very hard hit. </sentence><sentence id="90">My father was German citizen living on a passport. </sentence><sentence id="91">So the Poles said, "Mr. Kniiemann, why don't you go back to <span class="populated place">Brandenburg</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="92">That is what <span class="country">Germany</span> was called in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we got an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of 1932 to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father could have gone to <span class="populated place">Essen</span>; but <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was the next <span class="populated place">city</span>, really big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">And he had probably better opportunities to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="96">But he was in error. </sentence><sentence id="97">He came and he was told, "No job for you. " </sentence><sentence id="98">Because of his remark. </sentence><sentence id="99">And Hitler was not even in power then. </sentence><sentence id="100">But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic positions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not. </sentence><sentence id="101">So my father never got a job offer. </sentence><sentence id="102">He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: How did you survive financially? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: He was...he was actually a veteran. </sentence><sentence id="176">But being a German national, he had actually abdicated his right for pension because "I don't go and collect from my father[land]. " </sentence><sentence id="177">That was the attitude. </sentence><sentence id="178">An idiot, of course. ( </sentence><sentence id="179">Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick. </sentence><sentence id="180">He had TB, open TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a <span class="building">veteran's hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">And his pension was restored, but on a level about 50% disability. </sentence><sentence id="182">But he was really 250% disabled, really. </sentence><sentence id="183">So he spent uh half a year in the <span class="building">hospital</span>; was operated several times, of course, to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="184">But the acute conditions were removed. </sentence><sentence id="185">My mother and my sister and I, we lived in <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which cost as about 80% of our income. </sentence><sentence id="186">And when we came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, people didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="187">They thought we were criminals. </sentence><sentence id="188">Kicked out from <span class="country">Poland</span> for not paying  taxes, or stealing something, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="189">I mean, the Germans to me were completely insensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Why did they think that you were criminals? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: They thought I had a Polish accent. </sentence><sentence id="208">That is enough. </sentence><sentence id="209">You know, (laughing) people have funny notions. </sentence><sentence id="210">If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player. </sentence><sentence id="211">Hungarians can play violins very well. </sentence><sentence id="212">Most, I guess, don't play violins. </sentence><sentence id="213">But being of Polish, being...having this title "Polak"...And I, as a child going into <span class="building">Berlin school</span>, was treated as a Polak. </sentence><sentence id="214">My German was really quite good, but not perfect. </sentence><sentence id="215">I had a Polish accent and also uh didn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German. </sentence><sentence id="216">So when this happened, I sit down and really learned German. </sentence><sentence id="217">And actually better than most Germans. </sentence><sentence id="218">I really speak even today better German than most Germans. </sentence><sentence id="219">Definitely! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Tell me about your <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">You brought some photographs with you. </sentence><sentence id="235">Tell me about the birth certificate you have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="240">Here is my Polish birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="241">This is a major obstacle in my whole life. </sentence><sentence id="242">When people ask me, "What are you?" </sentence><sentence id="243">I say "Polish." </sentence><sentence id="244">They say, "No, your German gives you away. </sentence><sentence id="245">You are German." </sentence><sentence id="246">And, of course, here in <span class="country">America</span> I am now American citizen. </sentence><sentence id="247">Often people say, "But you have an accent." </sentence><sentence id="248">Then I say, "Yes, I was born Polish." </sentence><sentence id="249">And they say, "No, you have a German accent." </sentence><sentence id="250">I say, "Unfortunately, I suffered from being born in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">Because I had to immigrate here. </sentence><sentence id="252">The quota was full, and no entry for me in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">For long years, you know, I... So you get hit, no matter what you are. </sentence><sentence id="254">If you are different, you get it. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I learned that in <span class="country">Poland</span>, even when I was born, the kids came and met this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had when they saw something who was different from them. </sentence><sentence id="256">And it's everywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: You have other things as well. </sentence><sentence id="276">What is that you have now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: You want <span class="env feature">water</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="284">So this took also some doing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="285">I had avoided joining <span class="building">Nazi Youth Organization</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="286">I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="287">Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the sickest kid on the <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">So they got easy on me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="289">And uh besides, legal speaking, my age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it. </sentence><sentence id="290">The law actually uh spared those born before 1924. </sentence><sentence id="291">So I was born "22, and didn't encounter much trouble. </sentence><sentence id="292">But the authorities, when lL applied going to...to--let's say, <span class="building">college</span>--would call, they said, "You are not member of any Nazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know. </sentence><sentence id="293">Only we...are only interested in people who become leaders here." ( </sentence><sentence id="294">Laughter) I said, "I am not very much interested being a  leader, anyway." ( </sentence><sentence id="295">Laughter) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Show me what else. </sentence><sentence id="310">You have some photographs of you growing up. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now these would be in <span class="country">Poland</span> as a young child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="316">Here, that's the height of my career! ( </sentence><sentence id="317">Laughter) I always tried to climb up that tree.(Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture. </sentence><sentence id="318">I was 2-1/2 years old. </sentence><sentence id="319">So this was taken in 1924. </sentence><sentence id="320">This was my highest point in my career. </sentence><sentence id="321">I was really proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="322">You can see the <span class="dlf">branches</span> all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up. </sentence><sentence id="323">You see, I'm restless. </sentence><sentence id="324">am a go-getter. ( </sentence><sentence id="325">Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father immigrated, not immigrated, this <span class="region">area</span> was German under the Kaiserreich and the were interested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live there. </sentence><sentence id="326">So people wanted to expand, get a new <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">My uncle had done so. </sentence><sentence id="328">He was from <span class="populated place">Essen</span> in <span class="region">West Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And my father went to <span class="country">Poland</span>--or at that time it was <span class="country">Germany</span>--to beat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's <span class="building">firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">So, where they came from.. My father was the 24th child, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="331">The woman had two husbands. </sentence><sentence id="332">Of course, in succession, not at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="333">Although one could think...But there was no child after him. </sentence><sentence id="334">That was the end of the <span class="dlf">line</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="335">Laughing) But the <span class="building">house</span> where my family comes from was built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in <span class="populated place">Eisenberg</span> or <span class="populated place">Poleberg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="336">And I have just met people from <span class="populated place">Eisenach</span>, and they say, "Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the Kniiemann family, and they lived next to this <span class="building">house</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="337">Was taken by my father, I think, in 1923 or so. </sentence><sentence id="338">And these are my grandparents sitting in front. </sentence><sentence id="339">My grandfather was uh miner. </sentence><sentence id="340">There were these many children. </sentence><sentence id="341">One could only operate the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, so the others naturally went into the...under...into the <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">My grandfather worked there 73 years. </sentence><sentence id="343">And on the day of his retirement, he collapsed and was dead. </sentence><sentence id="344">Real great thing to have a <span class="spatial object">pension</span> waiting for you. ( </sentence><sentence id="345">Laughing) And they kept it all, you know. </sentence><sentence id="346">And another distinction my family had, my father was a veteran in the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="347">Lung shrapnel hit him. </sentence><sentence id="348">My grandfather--a veteran of 1971"--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the <span class="region">Prussian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">The French were...My grandfather, the same injury. </sentence><sentence id="350">In the war with Prussia/<span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">degSo same...almost the identical. </sentence><sentence id="352">I am first one without an injury. </sentence><sentence id="353">I think I learned a lesson from the past, you know. </sentence><sentence id="354">My father said, "If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come <span class="building">home</span> I beat you up like you never have been." ( </sentence><sentence id="355">Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his son to stand for this Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="356">He considered Hitler simple gangster. </sentence><sentence id="357">Nothing else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="358">He took everything and gave nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Tell me about...Tell me...You have one more picture there I want to show, about a <span class="building">school</span> woman. </sentence><sentence id="407">And I would like you to talk about your father. </sentence><sentence id="408">Yeah, that one. </sentence><sentence id="409">Tell me about that and the photographs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="414"> "NB: 1871. </sentence><sentence id="415">This would have been during the Franco-Prussian War. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="416">* 1866. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: This is...my schooling started in a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">I think this was a second year in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">It was a normal... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: Tn <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="434">Pause) They found. </sentence><sentence id="435">And uh so this teacher was a Doctor [<span class="populated place">Dunmever</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="436">A very strange occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="437">He was a hunchback. </sentence><sentence id="438">And, of course, like anyone in <span class="country">Germany</span> who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback, cross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen. </sentence><sentence id="439">And this man, because of his...I think, of his constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously kind. </sentence><sentence id="440">A person who... (sobbing) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Take a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: ...you could only love. </sentence><sentence id="460">And then this broken system came in, and this man was almost destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="461">You could feel it, that he was not Jewish or anything. </sentence><sentence id="462">But he knew me--as being what I am, I presented a target for these gangsters who came in. </sentence><sentence id="463">I was defective. </sentence><sentence id="464">Well, just before this picture was taken, maybe a day or two before, our <span class="interior space">room</span> was decorated with romantic scenes of <span class="env feature">landscape</span> and quieting pictures. </sentence><sentence id="465">In the middle of class, suddenly two workmen come in with a great stack of pictures. </sentence><sentence id="466">And you can see these pictures here. </sentence><sentence id="467">They represent <span class="spatial object">German warships</span>, <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, military pictures.

company was a Frenchman from <span class="region">Alsace-Lorraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1931">You know how it was, you wouldn't believe it, how you recognized each other, that you were anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I went into the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1933">I left, and he said the same dirty laugh; and I knew exactly that was the

actually Nazis were not that crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1947">They...[ mean you could have weapons, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1948">My father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1949">And, uh, since there were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1950">Besides, the

</sentence><sentence id="1952">They didn't know this. </sentence><sentence id="1953">I mean there was the <span class="region">West</span> that they contributed...you see that they were the victims of their own philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="1954">They thought Jews were the typical resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1955">There was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a

</sentence><sentence id="1968">They were sent for occupation duty in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1969">So, there was need for weapons and I had the military pass. </sentence><sentence id="1970">My father (laugh) conveniently got sick. </sentence><sentence id="1971">I went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and bought two big <span class="spatial

civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as souveniers from war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1974">And these women were impressed if they would be caught by, for instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times, mangled, (laugh) and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons in, you know, and I stood outside the <span class="dlf">collection point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I know even the place, it was <span class="building">Horst Wessel Platz</span>. </sentence><sentence
