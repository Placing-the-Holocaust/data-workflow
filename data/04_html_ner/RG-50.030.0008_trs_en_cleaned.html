<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: What was your childhood, your early, very early childhood like before the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: I have a very very few recollections of my early childhood. </sentence><sentence id="36">Actually I uh just remember flashbacks of my father who was...uh started to go away in 1939 and kept being drafted in <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> and uh he begin...he began to disappear for three to six months and then it became longer and longer. </sentence><sentence id="37">When they would draft him, it would take eight, nine months before he would return and then one time he was away for ten months, and finally in 1942, that was the last time he was drafted and he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="38">And uh remembering my mother who was a very bright woman and was able to take over and be the head of the family...I don't mean just the nuclear family but head of the extended family. </sentence><sentence id="39">In fact she was instrumental saving my grandmother and myself and a lot of my cousins during uh the war and the Nazi occupation. </sentence><sentence id="40">I remember that the whole family used to gather at my <span class="building">house</span> and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners at my <span class="building">house</span> and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us, that so...we were the gathering place for the whole family, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="41">That's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="42">I have pretty good memories of trips. </sentence><sentence id="43">We used to have a <span class="env feature">lake</span>, <span class="env feature">Lake</span> . </sentence><sentence id="44"> uncomplicated, very nice life before my father left in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: What do you remember about uh <span class="building">school</span>, playmates, friends during that period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Actually I don't remember an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="58">1 remember that about 1940 we used to have quite an elegant <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the middle of the <span class="populated place">city</span> and I remember that the Nazi party decided to have their <span class="building">headquarters</span> there, and uh we were evicted from the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and we had a hard time finding another <span class="interior space">apartment</span> being Jews and finally we found a less elegant but an OK <span class="interior space">apartment</span> uh in a in another part of the <span class="populated place">city</span> and I remember asking my mother to take the <span class="dlf">walls</span> with us because I really was very happy in that particular <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, but we were evicted and we moved into a much smaller <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and uh we were there until uh the Nazis occupied <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="62">Tell us, if you would, you started talked about 1940. </sentence><sentence id="63">So let's go on. </sentence><sentence id="64">Let's...tell me, as the war broke out indeed, uh in addition to the move, what happened to you, to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Well, in uh...as I remember and the dates may escape me...as I remember 1944 when all our troubles... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Let's let's back up a bit. </sentence><sentence id="72">Let's stick with, if we could...I don't want to jump to 1944 just yet. </sentence><sentence id="73">Let's let's talk a little about 1940, "41, and "42...the the early years. </sentence><sentence id="74">What, what was your life like? </sentence><sentence id="75">What did you as a child do to 2  and my cousins being only children, the families really could not, did not feel comfortable having more children because they could see the handwriting on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, and my mother herself decided to have an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="76">She told me that later, because she just couldn't bring another Jewish child to this world, our crazy mixed-up world as it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="83">But the early years as far as I was concerned were pleasant and they were alright. </sentence><sentence id="84">The difficulties started when we had to start wearing the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="85">That really, my self- esteem just plummeted and that was a very difficult period when a big yellow star was on a young child with uh the inscription of Jude, which meant I guess in German, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then that was already beginning of being marked as being different and less...oh what's the word I want to use...maybe not quite as competent as the other children were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Go on and tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="92">Tell us more about those years as things now began to be very difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="96">Things are begi...began to unfold at this point. </sentence><sentence id="97">We started to wear the Jewish star and we also had to be at the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> at a certain time. </sentence><sentence id="98">There was a curfew, but we still were able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on. </sentence><sentence id="99">We had to wear the Jewish star all the time whenever we left the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was sewn on our clothing, and we were marked as being different from the mainstream and psychologically I'm sure I really suffered from this distinction. </sentence><sentence id="101">And then afterwards uh we were told we had to leave our second <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because we had to move to a <span class="building">house</span> which was designated for Jews, and of course we left all our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> at the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and just took a few belongings and moved over to a <span class="building">house</span> which was designated to be a <span class="building">Jewish house</span> where Jews could live at that point. </sentence><sentence id="102">And uh we moved in with a sister of my father's, my paternal aunt. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was my grandfather, my aunt and her two children in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, and my grandmother and my mother and I in another <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was a <span class="interior space">two room apartment</span>, and we had to...we were there for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="105">I really can't remember how many months it was, but we were there for a few months and that's when things were starting to really get bad for us. </sentence><sentence id="106">First of all, we had very little food. </sentence><sentence id="107">When uh there were a lot of air raids we had to rush down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">At times we just didn't even bother to go. </sentence><sentence id="109">My mother says if we have to go , we'll just go, and that's when things really  around, making sure that all the young women were <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and ready to go to <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and my mother was covered up in the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and I was with my mother and I lied to the soldier. </sentence><sentence id="110">I told the soldier that my mother was sick and she could not go anywhere and she couldn't move, and I told the soldier...as a child I learned survival skills very early on...I told the soldier I have a doctor's certificate. </sentence><sentence id="111">If you just wait a minute I will get the doctor's certificate for you. </sentence><sentence id="112">Six years old and uh...seven maybe. </sentence><sentence id="113">And uh what happened was that uh...there was no doctor's certificate of course...I kept looking and looking and opening <span class="interior space">drawers</span> and started to really search for the doctor's certificate and the German soldier who could have been sixteen years as I was told, just left. </sentence><sentence id="114">He could have shot us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="115">He could have forced my mother to go, but by the stroke of luck he just left so I was told that I saved my mother's life at that point, which was probably true. </sentence><sentence id="116">But I also lived with that the rest of my life...that I am able to save people. </sentence><sentence id="117">And uh after that there were more roundups of Jews and the janitor one time who was a Christian woman my mother befriended...befriended and of course she also kept happy with various pieces of jewelry, came up to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to tell us that now you just have to go. </sentence><sentence id="118">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="119">Everybody's going to be taken to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and you just have to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="120">Well, we didn't know what to do at this point and somehow or other...this is where <span class="building">Wallenberg</span> comes into the picture. </sentence><sentence id="121">Somehow or other we gota __ they called. </sentence><sentence id="122">Somehow that afternoon my mother paid somebody off or somebody was willing to help. </sentence><sentence id="123">We got a to be able  ) arrived, but they did let us in and uh we made a little nitch in the <span class="dlf">corner</span> somewhere and we went to sleep at that point. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a very...it...l remem...I can't remember whether we were sleeping on <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> or just on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> but we were so tired and emotionally exhausted that it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had a safe, quote safe unquote place to put our heads down. </sentence><sentence id="126">Somehow my mother...we stayed there for could be a month to six weeks in this <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and it was pretty exciting because people were coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="127">We would listen to...play wegie (ph) boards of what's coming. </sentence><sentence id="128">We would listen to the the American broadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in the <span class="building">Swedish house</span>, my mother and I, and my cousins kept coming and since my mother told them since she had the it belonged to the whole family, so she managed to  I was uh...my mother and my grandmother, myself were getting ready to go on this march which again as a child it seemed to me was endless. </sentence><sentence id="129">I was in charge of the <span class="spatial object">photo albums</span>, to carry them to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and my mother carried of course whatever she could and my grandmother could never carry anything. </sentence><sentence id="130">She had heart problems and she hardly could walk. </sentence><sentence id="131">During this march they were shouting and shooting at Jews and we would just step over corpses like it was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="132">We just were psychologically numb and we were just walking around, walking along and did what we were supposed to do and I I dropped a photo albums and that's why I have very few photographs left before the war era and uh my mother yelled at me not to stop and bend over and pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="133">I can, in my mind's eye I can still see those pictures all over the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and uh I just had to leave them and march on. </sentence><sentence id="134">We were marching on for a little while, and then my grandmother said during the march...and this was really my most frightening experience in the war...my grandmother said she couldn't walk anymore, so the whole <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, the whole group had to stop. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was about two hundred people in this march, so everybody had to stop and the German soldiers came and told us that they're going to shoot my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="136">She's too old. </sentence><sentence id="137">She can't can't march. </sentence><sentence id="138">They're just going to shoot her to death, and we should all go on, and my mother said she's not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="139">If they're going to shoot my grandmother, let her let them shoot us all and we're just not going to leave an old lady. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="140">But I remember the guns pointing at my grandmother and subsequently the guns pointing at me and my mother and they were ready to shoot us, but then my mother saw a child in a <span class="spatial object">stroller</span> and we were so so...we we hardly have had any food at this point so we were all so thin that uh she picked up my grandmother and put her in the <span class="spatial object">stroller</span> and took the child out of the <span class="spatial object">stroller</span>, put my grandmother in the <span class="spatial object">stroller</span> and we marched on. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="142">So what happened, when we had to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> my grandmother was wheeled in a <span class="spatial object">stroller</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and we all made it. </sentence><sentence id="143">But I I'll never forget that scene and I'm still very frightened of any kind of violence and any kinds of guns because of this experience. </sentence><sentence id="144">It's just... when a young child has a gun pointed at her...just something happens and one never gets over this experience. </sentence><sentence id="145">But anyway, we were able to march into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did march into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">Of course the circumstances were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="147">I had lice all over me, not just in my hair. </sentence><sentence id="148">Body lice. </sentence><sentence id="149">We couldn't bathe. </sentence><sentence id="150">We couldn't eat and we were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for about two weeks before the Russians came in, and what I had heard about uh...the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the lack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three, four days before the Russians came to liberate, so my recollection of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> days are very hazy. </sentence><sentence id="151">I remember being in <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> in a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> sitting and not having any food and I remember other Jews eating chocolate while I was just starving and I had no food at all and nobody ever offered us some food, so it wasn't...it was survival of the fittest. </sentence><sentence id="152">It wasn't really let's all survive, at that point and again I think because of <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>...the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was undermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute, but I think because of <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span> we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids and a lot of fighting, but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that liberation couldn't be too far off. </sentence><sentence id="153">And that's how I survived those years. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Tell us, tell us what happened at liberation...what was it like and what did you and your family do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> and uh somehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="156">We got some food at last and little by little we were able to...I mean after being really singled out as Jews, able to be free and take our yellow stars off was just a very exhilarating, exciting and frightening moment at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="157">But little by little life got back. </sentence><sentence id="158">Of course we still didn't have food, but it was easier to obtain some foods later on and we were able to get back to our <span class="interior space">apartments</span> and uh try to resume life, and life was very difficult after...between 1948..."45 and 1956. </sentence><sentence id="159">I lived under the Russian oppression for about ten years and again food was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="160">It wasn't very fashionable to be Jews again and in fact I had to change...in order to obtain a job...<span class="building">college</span> was out of the question for me because I came from a capitalistic society and uh it was really out of the question for me. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had to change my name. </sentence><sentence id="162">I did attend a <span class="building">Jewish high school</span>, <span class="building">Jewish school</span> and <span class="building">Jewish high school</span> and uh I was singled out again as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="163">I had to change my name from Grossman to , which was a Hungarian name so I wouldn't be  revolutionary years. </sentence><sentence id="164">My husband then was a college student in <span class="country">Hungary</span> so he partook in some of the demonstrations and uh we decided after, when the Russians came back, we were best to escape <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">Of course by then we both were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="166">We knew how to survive, so we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to as close to the <span class="dlf">border</span> as possible when we decided to leave and uh we stayed with some peasants near the <span class="dlf">border</span> until we found a guide who could led us over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">The <span class="dlf">borders</span> were watched by Hungarian and Russian soldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape. </sentence><sentence id="168">Again we had to...oh we found this...I'm getting a little fuzzy here. </sentence><sentence id="169">The memories are just rushing back into my head. </sentence><sentence id="170">We escaped with my cousin and her husband and two small children ages three and five. </sentence><sentence id="171">And uh what happened was that the kids were scared and crying, so before when we paid off the guards in order to get across the <span class="dlf">border</span>, we had to get some rum and had to give it to the kids so the kids were drunk and fell asleep and my husband carried uh one kid and uh the kid's father carried another kid. </sentence><sentence id="172">We had to walk in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">The winter's are very difficult and heavy in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and we dark winter clothing on and we had to walk in this dark clothing in the snow at night to be inconspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="174">When the Russian or the Hungarian soldiers were shooting at us, we had to lie down in the snow with our dark winter clothing in order not to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="175">We walked across...we had to walk a good twenty miles until we got to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and the walk again was very very frightening. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was like deja vue. </sentence><sentence id="177">What happened as we were marching uh to escape...to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because they were shooting us at us from <span class="building">watch towers</span> and we had to know where to walk, where the <span class="dlf">border</span> wasn't undermined. </sentence><sentence id="178">Finally we got to a <span class="env feature">creek</span> which led us to <span class="country">Austria</span> and this is where I just knew I'll never make it. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was just ready to give up and die. </sentence><sentence id="180">I was so tired after...and scared...after walking for several hours at night in the <span class="env feature">snow</span> that I was just ready to give up. </sentence><sentence id="181">There was a <span class="spatial object">log</span> between uh <span class="country">Austria</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span> and people walked across the <span class="spatial object">log</span> but I wasn't coordinated enough and I wasn't...I was so tired I knew I'll never make it. </sentence><sentence id="182">So finally people told me to sit on that <span class="spatial object">log</span> and I was able to just crawl over to <span class="country">Austria</span> on that <span class="spatial object">log</span>, and I was very fortunate because we made it over. </sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of people were taken back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">They could not escape, but we were again very fortunate to be able to manage to get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="216">What did you do when you got to <span class="country">Austria</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
