<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: And you were part of some of these <span class="building">youth organizations</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: I started to go to a <span class="building">Hashamiratzaire</span>, for various reasons. </sentence><sentence id="76">One is this is the only place where -- where I -- we could play ping pong, and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="77">As children we were -- we were -- this was influential, playing together, and -- but in -- dreaming one day to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">And in the matter of fact, my f -- my sister went, before the war to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">Before the war started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Of course, part of the reason I ask this is that you later on, and -- were very active with the partisans, and I just wondered if -- if any of this came from kind of your life, or your ideology before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="88">This was a -- in the partisan it was simply because a -- as a way of -- to survive, and to take reveng -- revenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: We knew that there was a ge -- there were <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, and something was going on it's bad for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="102">But we did not know much. </sentence><sentence id="103">Cause -- because later we knew what was going on till deg39, because there were Jew -- papers, so we -- so we knew that Hitler is anti-Semite -- Semitic, and there are certain <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but at that time, nobody spoke about mass destruction somewhere, or -- or -- or killings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: And you probably didn't think that that would affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: No, till -- till the -- when the war started, yes, we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> when the war started, because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight, and I'1l not be on the side with the Germans, but I'll be in the -- where the pol - - Polish are, and -- but unfortunately on their way, the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, to -- practically to -- see, they didn't take <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, but  close to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, so that I was under the Germans, and -- and decided to go back to our <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">When I came to our <span class="populated place">city</span>, was about a few days, the commander of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, a ger -- the German, told all Jews to come out one day. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was about the 15" abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and took them out towards the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">Left us in a place where the Polish army used to exercise. </sentence><sentence id="113">The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="114">And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable. </sentence><sentence id="115">Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="116">And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw. </sentence><sentence id="117">And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn't understand a word what he said. </sentence><sentence id="118">My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian. </sentence><sentence id="119">So he said, "Oh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us." </sentence><sentence id="120">Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small place me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us. </sentence><sentence id="121">For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Couple questions. </sentence><sentence id="136">First, I'm sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward <span class="region">Russian territory</span> rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="139"> A As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this is why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our <span class="populated place">city</span> will be incorporated in the -- in the <span class="country">Reich</span>, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the <span class="country">Reich</span>, so they sa -- told us to go. </sentence><sentence id="140">And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- <span class="dlf">borders</span> were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived. </sentence><sentence id="141">More Polish Jews survived after that in <span class="country">Russia</span> than in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">The mood was of unknown. </sentence><sentence id="143">We don't know what expects us. </sentence><sentence id="144">We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew. </sentence><sentence id="145">If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the <span class="building">market</span>. [ </sentence><sentence id="146">indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="147">So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison is all the <span class="populated place">cities</span> around <span class="populated place">Shasnich</span>, more Jews survived <span class="populated place">Shasnich</span> than all the -- in the <span class="populated place">cities</span> around it, because they were completely destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Was there a risk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Oh yes, there was a risk, because there were a lot of people killed, I mean, but my brother-in-law even -- when -- later when the slats went even into -- into -- to <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">He went out of the <span class="populated place">city</span> 10 - 20 miles, and there exchange it, and bring it back, were two guy. </sentence><sentence id="440">I went a few times, but since I wear glasses, they immediately recognized me as a Jew, and -- because Russians usually don't wear glasses. </sentence><sentence id="441">So I used to walk without glasses, and without glasses I don't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="442">So I couldn't go too much -- too often. </sentence><sentence id="443">Once or  twice I went -- once or twi -- a number of times I went out. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was one family was working the place where they were making vodka. [ </sentence><sentence id="445">indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka, and we had a steady guy who was giving us food, either flour, or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka. </sentence><sentence id="446">We were a steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us. </sentence><sentence id="447">And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I -- and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the <span class="building">police station</span>, because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="448">But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and he saw there the bottle vodka was still on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, what I left, and there -- and they took me out into the - - took me back to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and said, don't -- to the -- go -- go back to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, don't ever come back, and that was strange. </sentence><sentence id="449">And after that, the guy with who [indecipherable] I saw him in -- in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="450">And I thought that it was two policemen. </sentence><sentence id="451">I said, "What are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="452">He said, "I am a -- 1am a Jewish guy, and I was outside, and this policeman caught me. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then we saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka. </sentence><sentence id="454">So we went to this place, and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="455">And he let you go, too." </sentence><sentence id="456">So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we're -- we're walking around with something to cut the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, in order to be able to pass. </sentence><sentence id="458">But the question, well what you do after that?Everybody was -- most of the people were scared. </sentence><sentence id="459">There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn't open the <span class="dlf">door</span>, because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it. </sentence><sentence id="460">Because they were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="461">They did not want to be killed just because I came there. </sentence><sentence id="462">So we were going -- we were taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="463">At <span class="building">work</span> we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">And there I was always either begging, if it was a - -a-- if] -- if 1 cleaned the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> of soldiers, begging them if they have a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="465">A good -- a good German was giving me a piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick. </sentence><sentence id="466">So if it was outside the <span class="populated place">cities</span>, I was -- there were always something growing, so we're stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="467">And if the -- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn't have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato <span class="spatial object">latkes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">And this is on what they lived. </sentence><sentence id="469">Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski. </sentence><sentence id="470">He was a -- he had written on the -- <span class="building">belina politsi</span> was written. </sentence><sentence id="471">He spoke Russian and German, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="472">And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="473">And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again. </sentence><sentence id="474">And this was not work, it was just making fun of us. </sentence><sentence id="475">Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from place to place, and then another group was taking it further, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="476">This was fun for him. </sentence><sentence id="477">So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a <span class="populated place">camp</span> separate. </sentence><sentence id="478">The people could not come from [indecipherable] outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come <span class="building">home</span> to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they were sleeping over there. </sentence><sentence id="480">So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work,  taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at <span class="building">home</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="481">This we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="482">In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- it was on <span class="dlf">Schirrocca Street</span>, I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">A very -- we moved the <span class="dlf">wall</span> in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, made it a little narrower. </sentence><sentence id="484">Since we worked in construction, I went to the <span class="interior space">neighbors room</span> and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through. </sentence><sentence id="485">And in our place was just wood. </sentence><sentence id="486">So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they're looking for -- for men, you are running <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="487">Where do you hide in the -- in there? </sentence><sentence id="488">And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don't catch you. </sentence><sentence id="489">They looked -- they told us, they look for where we're hiding, and they didn't no -- they didn't no -- notice that we had build this -- this <span class="dlf">double wall</span> to hide. </sentence><sentence id="490">Other people were hiding behind -- under the <span class="interior space">floor</span> -- the fir -- <span class="interior space">floor</span>, there was a place to crawl in, and they were hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="491">So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families. </sentence><sentence id="492">Since we lived all in a place where the <span class="dlf">street</span> was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other side was <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, on this side was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="494">And taking them out and then they never came back. </sentence><sentence id="495">And they shortened the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they made the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller. </sentence><sentence id="496">So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here? </sentence><sentence id="497">In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span> where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in <span class="spatial object">automobile</span>, and they gas the people in there. </sentence><sentence id="498">So whenever we heard -- heard <span class="spatial object">cars</span> coming, we started to hide. </sentence><sentence id="499">What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, was crying there. </sentence><sentence id="500">So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="501">On the first <span class="interior space">floor</span>, there was one part which was not finished. </sentence><sentence id="502">In one of the not finished <span class="interior space">room</span>, they build a deep, in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, we put wa -- <span class="spatial object">tube</span>, so to -- so they'll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, outside you didn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="503">So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with <span class="env feature">sand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="504"><span class="env feature">Sand</span> made it even so that you don't see that anything is there. </sentence><sentence id="505">Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="506">And this way how we were all kind of -- we call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: Mostly it was the -- the killers were Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="580">They were -- they surrounded a -- a -- an <span class="region">area</span>, took the Jews out, into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> nearby. </sentence><sentence id="581">In most of the cases, we knew that there will be a pogrom, because there are people who worked for the ge -- for the -- in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and they heard a -- a group sondercommander came in. </sentence><sentence id="582">And when a sondercommander came in, means something will be happening -- will be happening in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">And indeed, they used to use Ukrainians or Latvians, and encircle a certain <span class="region">area</span>, one <span class="dlf">street</span>, or two <span class="dlf">street</span>, take all the people out in the morning, and lead them out from the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="584">In most of the cases, we saw them through this way, between the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, wik -- which was a -- a <span class="dlf">passage</span> from north to <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="585">So we su -- sometime when we looked, we saw hey, they are  0 taking out a group of people, a number of people. </sentence><sentence id="586">And once they have circled also, the people from the other side of the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and they emptied there. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I thought they" make the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller. </sentence><sentence id="588">And they -- instead of this, they brought German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="589">Jews from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, Jews from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, they brought there, and they were there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2219">A: It took me a long time to forget that the war is over, and I tried always to remind me, Sam, the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="2220">For instance, whenever somebody asked me a question, automatically I was thinking, is it better to -- to answer in this way, or the other way. </sentence><sentence id="2221">A simple thing. </sentence><sentence id="2222">How old are you? </sentence><sentence id="2223">I was always automatically thinking -- thinking -- thinking, should I say I'm five years older, or should I say I'm few years younger? </sentence><sentence id="2224">I never thought about tell the truth, because always I thought a -- what is better? </sentence><sentence id="2225">Is it in this situation better to by younger, or is it to be older? </sentence><sentence id="2226">And on any question like this, I never - - automatically I did -- my -- my head worked in this way, which answer is better, not what is the truth, to answer truly. </sentence><sentence id="2227">And after that, I realized, Sam, the war is over, you can tell the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2228">And took me a long time, till I overcame this thinking, that you can answer, there is no danger any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2239">Q: Now, wa -- was this because you always had to manipulate the truth? </sentence><sentence id="2240">Was this because you didn't trust people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2243">A: Oh, both. </sentence><sentence id="2244">Mostly it was because to manipulate was better. </sentence><sentence id="2245">In some places it was better to be younger, let's say, cause then you'll be able -- in other places was better to be older, then there -- then you can do in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2246">These things still remained, and I -- as I said, this was automatic with me. </sentence><sentence id="2247">I had to fight to -- to a -- you can tell the truth, there -- they -- there is no danger any more. </sentence><sentence id="2248">Because still I was thinking there is a danger in -- in -- lurking somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2249">And I had to fight this myself to answer the truth, to tell the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2250">To forget about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2259">Q: What else? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2305">A: Not that I think now about it, although I -- I worried often about the safety, not saying anything maybe. </sentence><sentence id="2306">But maybe I was overcautious in various <span class="region">area</span>, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2307">But it definitely -- I wa -- I was i -- always think, hey is this -- is it safe, can they go somewhere on a -- toa <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2308">Who will -- is it safe to be in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2309">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I had to think it over. </sentence><sentence id="2311">I di -- I didn't talk about it, but I was thinking to myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2319">Q: What were some of the other difficulties in kind of adjusting to a new life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2321">A: I cannot think, because I had all the time -- had to adjust each time, to adjust to a different language, or to -- because in the beginning everything was -- let's say I was raised in <span class="country">Poland</span>, Polish, and after that to adjust everything in Russian, then I was adjusting back to Polish, then to German, and after that were ex -- exa -- to -- to -- to English. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And -- so it was adjusting was constantly. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I was doing it all the time, till here I thought I am now -- I am here, I am an -- an American now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2337">Q: Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2339">A: And I probably did not overcome this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2341">Q: Are you -- are you religious now, or have -- di-did you raise your children Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2343">A: Yes, we belong to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and -- and actually it was -- in the beginning I could not go to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2344">In -- in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, let's say whenever there was a Jewish holiday, I did not go to -- to -- simply to show a -- Iam Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And I used to go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, but I was always outside, not going in -- in to -- to pray, because I understood Hebrew -- I understand Hebrew, I learned Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And whenever there was written, God is full of mercy, I could not see where -- where he was. </sentence><sentence id="2347">I saw th -- the -- that children, and that --  8 that people. </sentence><sentence id="2348">So, I could not pray for a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="2349">But after that, here, when I thought, yeah, if I will not go to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and my wife wanted the children to be raised [indecipherable], if not, then they will become -- they'1l stop being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2350">So I agreed yes, we'll go to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and we belonged to a <span class="building">synagogue</span> since then, and we tried to raise our children Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2359">Q: Is this important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2361">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Yes, because this is a way how e -- how they can stay Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2363">In <span class="country">Poland</span> you could be Jewish without being religious. </sentence><sentence id="2364">In <span class="country">Israel</span> you can be Jewish without being religious. </sentence><sentence id="2365">But in the <span class="country">United States</span>, if you don't belong to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and you don't na -- then you stop being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2366">So this is important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2373">Q: What do you think gave you, sort of the courage, and the strength to get through all of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2375">A: In the beginning it was a will to survive, so see again my -- my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2376">To see my brothers and sister. </sentence><sentence id="2377">At a certain time it was -- a certain amount was a desire to re -- of revenge. </sentence><sentence id="2378">And not only it was expected to me -- from me, I remember in the Red army, when we entered the first <span class="populated place">German village</span>, and there were only a couple of old people remained in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, how everybody else ran away. </sentence><sentence id="2379">And the soldiers come me, "Sam, there are the -- they are still Germans, we should go kill them." </sentence><sentence id="2380">And I asked them, [indecipherable] I say, should I? </sentence><sentence id="2381">I told them, "Why should I kill them? </sentence><sentence id="2382">They didn't do anything bad to me." </sentence><sentence id="2383">They says, "You are Jewish, didn't they kill all Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="2384">And I told them, "So, what do you want me to be like the -- like the German SS, do the same thing?" </sentence><sentence id="2385">Within myself I saw a -- I cannot do what they did. </sentence><sentence id="2386">So I had opportunity to kill Germans, but I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2387">But there was a certain -- during the war, there was a certain amount of desire for revenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2401">Q: Was there anything in your upbringing that kind of gave you the s -- the strength you needed to -- to get through this? </sentence><sentence id="2402">Were there things that you thought about while you were fighting, or that you dreamed about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2405">A: No, I would not say this, because my father always wanted me to be kind, and -- and -- and -- and -- and understandable of other people need. </sentence><sentence id="2406">No, I would not say that upbringing did it, it is the experience during the war which made me. </sentence><sentence id="2407">It is only -- it was one thing that I -- when I was as a partisan walking through the -- at night sometimes, somewhere through the <span class="populated place">village</span>, and I thought, hey, why did -- how come -- why -- why did not -- I not have a rifle when I was in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2408">I would have felt differently. </sentence><sentence id="2409">That it will cost somebody s-something to kill me, that they cannot kill just people for -- for nothing, and without paying any -- a price for it. </sentence><sentence id="2410">So this -- and this is sometimes left -- sometimes when I think about people here having so mu -- so mu -- rifles, and they causing here death, I still sometimes think a -- but if Jews had rifles during -- in 1939, many more Germans would have paid with their life, or Ukrainians for -- for killing  9 them. </sentence><sentence id="2411">So it's -- it affects today my thinking that I am not so against -- so much against the <span class="building">National Rifle Organization</span> as may be if I would have not had my experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2419">Q: What else did you think about while you were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2421">A: Oh, if I was thinking, I -- it was a dream that I -- that I will one day be sitting here in -- and answer question and tell stories about it. </sentence><sentence id="2422">I never believed that such a day will come. </sentence><sentence id="2423">I thought I am destined to be killed, but I want to pay a price -- that they pay a price for killing me. </sentence><sentence id="2424">But I didn't believe that I'll survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2429">Q: Did you think about your family when you were in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2431">A: Oh, always. </sentence><sentence id="2432">They were always close and I was thanking God that we did not have my -- money -- enough money so the whole family will go to -- to <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, otherwise I would have not been able to -- to run away and then -- and this is what happened to a lot of young people who stayed, did not go away because they could not leave their mothers or -- or fathers. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Because very often, they were supplying the food, you know, for the -- temporarily to s -- to survive, even -- even when a lot of people were hungry, but still the young people were those who were helping them. </sentence><sentence id="2434">And a lot of them could not go away and leave their parents, or brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2435">So I thank God that -- that it -- that only -- that only I was the one who went to <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, and they stayed far back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2441">Q: Are there certain, or were there, I guess, certain things that happened to you here that would evoke certain memories, whether it was a smell, or a sound, or something someone said that all of a sudden would make you think back to these difficult experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2456">Q: And maybe he was just being complimentary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2458">A: Yes, that they want to get acquainted with Jewish culture, and so on, so [indecipherable], and he gave this as a reason, but there was [indecipherable] yet. </sentence><sentence id="2459">Jews could not help effect t-to -- to bomb <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, or -- or -- or other things li-like this, and -- or -- or influence the British to let Patria, and -- and -- and what is the name, the -- the two <span class="spatial object">ships</span> which were blown up after that? </sentence><sentence id="2460">People tried to escape, and come to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2461">They didn't have the influence at that time, but now, suddenly they have the influence. </sentence><sentence id="2462"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
