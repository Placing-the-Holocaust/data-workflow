<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5"> A My name is Amalie Petranker. </sentence><sentence id="6">Now it's <span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born October 21st, 1922 in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, but I was just born there. </sentence><sentence id="8">Why? </sentence><sentence id="9">It was an accident. </sentence><sentence id="10">My mother was visiting there, but I was raised, brought up and till "42 I lived in <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> (ph) which is now </sentence></p><p><sentence id="11"> . </sentence><sentence id="12">It's very much to the southeast of <span class="country">Poland</span> as <span class="populated place">Landberg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="13"><span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span>  I'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good education, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he would have foreseen what future would be. </sentence><sentence id="14">My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet woman. </sentence><sentence id="15">She was very young. </sentence><sentence id="16">She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one when my oldest sister, so she was like one of us. </sentence><sentence id="17">And maybe it's good she was easy- going, because my late father was like a Prussian officer. </sentence><sentence id="18">He didn't have any sons, so he actually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="19">He was fair but very demanding, so she in a way protected us. </sentence><sentence id="20">Sometimes when he was strict, she did. </sentence><sentence id="21">He demanded, but now I'm very grateful. </sentence><sentence id="22">At that time it was very hard on us, like for example, we attended <span class="building">private schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">He wanted us to be protected from being called kikes and Jews, so from the <span class="building">kindergarten</span>...we went to a <span class="building">Hebrew kindergarten</span> where all, we spoke only Hebrew...we went to <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> from the first grade to the sixth where all the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of course <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> because the language, prevalent language was Polish, but we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="24">My older one was <span class="building">Pepi</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="25">I was the middle one and my younger one was <span class="populated place">Teela</span> (ph) and we were just a year apart, so like first, second, third grade. </sentence><sentence id="26">Second, third and fourth. </sentence><sentence id="27">So we were called <span class="building">inschool</span> _, ; , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you know, and we looked alike. </sentence><sentence id="28">As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very much like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and unfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I was unhappy because in <span class="country">Europe</span> was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle and the middle to the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="30">In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't so pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not only what we had a lot of work in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">It was very demanding because it was very expensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the <span class="building">school</span>, would take us out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish and to cont...to go to <span class="building">medical school</span>, so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the only day off. </sentence><sentence id="32">Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time, every Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him </sentence></p><p><sentence id="33"> , the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak (ph), and every Saturday, summer time, . </sentence><sentence id="34">At that time we resented it very  and prominent in lumber business, the director from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> came and told him, you cannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director, and he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on I'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival. </sentence><sentence id="35">As a rule, we were sheltered. </sentence><sentence id="36">We didn't have a lot to do with the Christian population. </sentence><sentence id="37">Actually each minority kept to itself. </sentence><sentence id="38">We didn't have too much problem. </sentence><sentence id="39">Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays, because other <span class="building">schools</span> were closed. </sentence><sentence id="40">Our <span class="building">school</span> was next to a <span class="building">church</span>, so this was a day free for them to throw stones on us. </sentence><sentence id="41">As children I resented it to be singled out. </sentence><sentence id="42">I was hurt. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">But this was something we couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="44">It...even when...it became so bad before the outbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an <span class="dlf">iron gate</span> around our <span class="building">school</span>...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our <span class="dlf">school yard</span> and to throw stone and to beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="45">In our <span class="populated place">town</span>, there were some incidents of anti-Semites, especially when there were students came from <span class="building">universities</span> at Christmas time and Easter and they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually very strong physically, the <span class="building">butchers</span>, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared and they used to take a <span class="spatial object">two-by-four</span> and fight back. </sentence><sentence id="46">They didn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="47">Now uh we had good relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities. </sentence><sentence id="48">So before the war, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late father needed for example a loan. </sentence><sentence id="49">He went, he got a loan from <span class="building">Ukrainian bank</span>, but not from the <span class="building">Bellish</span> (ph) uh, <span class="building">Polish bank</span>, from the <span class="building">state bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="51">We were three daughters. </sentence><sentence id="52">My <span class="building">house</span> always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of us came one friend. </sentence><sentence id="53">My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she was named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother, because my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="54">We were very close friends and this was through the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="55">And also I was very close to my younger sister. </sentence><sentence id="56">We loved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure that she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when Malia will get married. </sentence><sentence id="57">With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference between us, but my older didn't want to bother with us. </sentence><sentence id="58">She went with other friends. </sentence><sentence id="59">And we had beautiful <span class="dlf">parks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">We participated. </sentence><sentence id="61">We used to go to <span class="populated place">summer camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">Wintertime, the winter vacation. </sentence><sentence id="63">We went skiing. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had pretty normal, happy life. </sentence><sentence id="65">It's true it was not the life of all the Jews in my <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">There was a select group, <span class="region">middle</span> and above which could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="67">There were poor Jews. </sentence><sentence id="68">There were Jews who after the mandatory six grades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl. </sentence><sentence id="69">I would say there are some very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="70">We had some magnets (ph) like , very very rich who donated <span class="spatial object">planes</span> to the government. </sentence><sentence id="71">Majority  will come for order and safety of the <span class="populated place">city</span> "till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate. </sentence><sentence id="72">So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="73">Some <span class="building">buildings</span> were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="74">But this was at the beginning, in "39, September. </sentence><sentence id="75">The Russians came to our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">They occupied it. </sentence><sentence id="77">It was not for time being like we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="78">We didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="79">So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding. </sentence><sentence id="80">So we stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">When we questioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so we, so some just asked and tell me...how about ; . </sentence><sentence id="82">Do you have a lot of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="83"> ? </sentence><sentence id="84">And they said no, . </sentence><sentence id="85">So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not true. </sentence><sentence id="86">Our life changed drastically. </sentence><sentence id="87">Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called bourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we were any moment destined to be shipped to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, and in a way I wish it would happened. </sentence><sentence id="88">Maybe my parents would survive. </sentence><sentence id="89">And also, I was at that time, I graduated from first . </sentence><sentence id="90">| was supposed to go to the second and graduate. </sentence><sentence id="91">So they entered it, and the ten-year system they call it, the <span class="building">class</span>, and the standard of learning and living changed. </sentence><sentence id="92">Like my foreign language was English. </sentence><sentence id="93">This is why I have such an accent even now, because I learned in the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, but for them learning languages...I mean unless you're in <span class="building">special school</span>, was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for comprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="94">Lowered the standard. </sentence><sentence id="95">But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard. </sentence><sentence id="96">But the problem is immediately they developed , with <span class="building">political departments</span>, and each student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless you report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined. </sentence><sentence id="97">Always threatened. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="98">And then we saw our <span class="building">schoolmates</span> suddenly taken in by . </sentence><sentence id="99">They had special <span class="spatial object">cars</span> which they took away. </sentence><sentence id="100">This installed fear in us. </sentence><sentence id="101">My father, who was a government high official, was in business, suddenly became a laborer. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I was accepted to <span class="building">institute</span> they call it. </sentence><sentence id="103">They didn't want to take me to the <span class="building">medical school</span>, but they were short in teachers, so they expec...uh accepted me to <span class="building">Institute</span> they call it, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="104"> . </sentence><sentence id="105">Means math and physics. </sentence><sentence id="106">After four months, I was called in. </sentence><sentence id="107"> from my <span class="populated place">town</span> who came for vacation and met her. </sentence><sentence id="108">He was eleven years her senior. </sentence><sentence id="109">He fell in love with her. </sentence><sentence id="110">They were in a <span class="building">resort</span> and he wanted to marry her. </sentence><sentence id="111">The war broke out, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged. </sentence><sentence id="112">After the war I will come back. </sentence><sentence id="113">I will marry you. </sentence><sentence id="114">Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">My sister had chosen to get married. </sentence><sentence id="116">My parents didn't approve. </sentence><sentence id="117">She was only eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's brother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in <span class="country">Palestine</span>, so she explained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they permitted. </sentence><sentence id="118">I'll never forget the day when she left. </sentence><sentence id="119">First of all, we were never separated, and like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have a premonition. </sentence><sentence id="120">She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known this was the last time that she sees her. ( </sentence><sentence id="121">crying) So my sister left for <span class="country">Palestine</span> and my family was my parents, my younger sister and I. When the Russo (ph) German war broke out in "41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , Means permit to evacuate with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="122">I came <span class="building">home</span> with this, and I presented it to my parents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="123">You are not leaving the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us. </sentence><sentence id="125">And my mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War. </sentence><sentence id="126">They are civilized people. </sentence><sentence id="127">I don't believe the atrocities that we hear. </sentence><sentence id="128">This must be Russian propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="129">We are staying put in the place. </sentence><sentence id="130">So, I was supposed to leave with my boyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the <span class="building">railroad authority</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called . </sentence><sentence id="132">This was the highest official, but he has a special <span class="spatial object">car</span> for himself on the <span class="dlf">line</span> from my <span class="populated place">town</span> to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, so we could have escaped. </sentence><sentence id="133">He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who by the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our parents don't want. </sentence><sentence id="134">But my father forbade me. </sentence><sentence id="135">So when the Ru...Russo-German war broke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="136">The Hungarian army entered my <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> or . </sentence><sentence id="137">The Hungarians were very were good to us and  declined it. </sentence><sentence id="138">I couldn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="139">Not that I loved him but he...[ was impressed. __ </sentence><sentence id="140">ten years old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were assigned for slave labor with the army. </sentence><sentence id="141">Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his friend before the war. </sentence><sentence id="142">Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="143">So even the Baron Moore talked to my father. </sentence><sentence id="144">Listen, now he's infatuated with your daughter, but you are wise not to let her go. </sentence><sentence id="145">He is the first-born. </sentence><sentence id="146">His mother would not tolerate it, anditmay bea___ unto your daughter. </sentence><sentence id="147">You're very smart, but my father didn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me. </sentence><sentence id="148">He stated the reason that even I understood is right at that time. </sentence><sentence id="149">Meantime, this was...they were shipped to <span class="country">Russia</span>, to fight in <span class="country">Russia</span>, and the Germans entered. </sentence><sentence id="150">At that time, they shipped Russian, uh Hungarian Jews to our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and when the Germans entered, they kept the Jews on . </sentence><sentence id="151">It was a big <span class="building">mill house</span> uh and they were kept there. </sentence><sentence id="152">When the Germans  from the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the professionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And my sister still remained in the main <span class="building">building</span> to clean. </sentence><sentence id="154">You know, the Jews from <span class="country">Hungary</span> were sitting there in the <span class="interior space">coal (ph) yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">They brought them from the <span class="building">mill</span>, from , to the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> of the Gestapo, and they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="156">They were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="157">They were tired. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were beaten, with children. </sentence><sentence id="159">They were there. </sentence><sentence id="160">My sister went to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work and for me, she dropped through the <span class="dlf">window</span> for them to eat. </sentence><sentence id="161">A Gestapo officer noticed it, and he brought her down to there. </sentence><sentence id="162">Since then I have never seen her. </sentence><sentence id="163">She started to cry, and there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should notify me, who can talk that I can do something for her. </sentence><sentence id="164">This is a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="165">Then they take her out. </sentence><sentence id="166">I tried. </sentence><sentence id="167">So there were Gestapo who took me out of the <span class="dlf">line</span>, he was in charge and when I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe he will listen to me, and I forgot in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> we were told not to wear the armbands. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="168">When he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="169">So you're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a band. </sentence><sentence id="171">I'll shoot you too. </sentence><sentence id="172">Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173">He let me go...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="174">The Gestapo, how cruel he was. </sentence><sentence id="175">He kept telling me and his fiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that they took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field hands. </sentence><sentence id="176">After fall, they will release her. </sentence><sentence id="177">So, I came <span class="building">home</span> and I had to bring the news to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="178">Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I was very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother. </sentence><sentence id="179">My mother was only forty years old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day. </sentence><sentence id="180">And we still believed...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="181">Meantime we saw shooting on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, random shooting. </sentence><sentence id="182">They took the Jews and to work on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> or to work at <span class="dlf">bridges</span> and then sometimes they used to throw them into the <span class="env feature">river</span> and Russians erected many <span class="spatial object">monuments</span> so they took the Jews to destroy the <span class="spatial object">monuments</span>, and many of them were shot. </sentence><sentence id="184">They didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="185">This was going on till around, till September, and I still work at that time by this <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Then we were told that we will have to leave our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and to move to a <span class="region">section</span> which was designated as <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">This was the <span class="region">poorest section</span> of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="188">Being...again we lived like on the <span class="dlf">5th Avenue</span>, my parents secured immediately an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the future <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move. </sentence><sentence id="189">We transferred our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="190">We still kept only a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span>, the essential thing in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and on...while we lived on <span class="populated place">35</span>, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move. </sentence><sentence id="191">Then suddenly, on , October  the men are in danger. </sentence><sentence id="192">So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the <span class="interior space">attics</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">Each <span class="building">condominium</span>, <span class="building">condominium</span> had it's own part of the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and it's own part in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, so we have hidden my father on the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">My mother got the key. </sentence><sentence id="195">And after an hour, my mother's cousin who lived...also owned a <span class="building">condominium</span> in this <span class="building">complex</span> came and said look, it's very unsafe to stay in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">Let's all go to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and let's hide there, and this was a <span class="building">house</span> like a <span class="dlf">facade</span> (ph)...many <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">She thought it's safe there. </sentence><sentence id="198">I really never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents. </sentence><sentence id="199">I refused to go with her down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> with the family and other Jewish neighbors. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="200">Only one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she had, she had also hidden her husband. </sentence><sentence id="201">She decided to stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="202">My reasoning was they will come in. </sentence><sentence id="203">They will see empty <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">They will not enter the last <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">This is how my reasoning went, and I refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="206">I stayed with her in the, in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="207">We heard...we heard cries. </sentence><sentence id="208">We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="209">By noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, <span class="populated place">Rister</span> (ph), and he said your mother would like you very much to come. </sentence><sentence id="210">Please don't be stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="211">Again, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="212">I don't know why I was so stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="213">I can't explain to today. </sentence><sentence id="214">I refused to come down. </sentence><sentence id="215">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="216">Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to venture in the <span class="interior space">hall</span> and to find out what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="217">Our Christian neighbors said, you are here. </sentence><sentence id="218">They took everybody from the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">They loaded them on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they took them to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">It was a terrible shock. </sentence><sentence id="221">I didn't know how to act. </sentence><sentence id="222">But I still didn't suspect that this was for killing. </sentence><sentence id="223">This was the first time. </sentence><sentence id="224">So I thought maybe this is the <span class="populated place">gathering place</span>, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">Finally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out. </sentence><sentence id="226">Before we managed to go, my neighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came . </sentence><sentence id="227">Straight hair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the
