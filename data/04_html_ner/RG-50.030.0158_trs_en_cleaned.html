<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: In uh a little <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Trest</span>, T- R-E -S-T. In <span class="country">Germany</span>, it's called <span class="populated place">Trich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">And it was a uh <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> that has been around for something like two or three hundred years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: In what <span class="country">country</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: In <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">And uh the <span class="populated place">town</span> is exactly half way between <span class="populated place">Prague</span> and <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">And it used to be a very important <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">The way it was in uh <span class="region">Central Europe</span> that uh Jews were mostly in the <span class="region">rural areas</span>, and as the industrialization of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, of <span class="region">Bohemia and Moravia</span>, took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough) bringing about uh opportunities outside the <span class="region">rural areas</span> and so gradually uh the real people with the guts would, leaved the little <span class="populated place">town</span> and go to bigger <span class="populated place">cities</span> in uh <span class="populated place">Prague</span> or <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> or <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">Some of them even would go abroad or to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Let's talk about Frank Meissner though, and Frank Meissner's <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, this was my <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Tell us about uh <span class="populated place">Trest</span>? </sentence><sentence id="30">Tell us about your family first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, in the first place uh the <span class="populated place">city</span> was, has had a population of five thousand for years and years and years and it still does. </sentence><sentence id="34">And uh the <span class="populated place">community</span> from its highest uh the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy hundred (ph) in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="35">And our family has always been one of the important families in <span class="populated place">town</span> and has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh presidents of the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="36">Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as if uh some couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a <span class="building">factory</span> for making uh shoes, wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="37">And then when uh leather shoes became uh the thing to do he had to close down the <span class="building">factory</span> and became in uh <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">So uh my mother and father worked full time in the <span class="building">factory</span> and I had a whatever you called it, German  and uh the <span class="building">furniture factory</span> went bust during the financial troubles. </sentence><sentence id="39">So uh we could no longer have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together. </sentence><sentence id="40">My mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a <span class="building">machine factory</span>, and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days called a uh <span class="building">househusband</span>, I presume. </sentence><sentence id="41">Which was at that time very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="42">And uh because of the <span class="populated place">town</span> was uh small we didn't have a <span class="building">high school</span>, so when I was uh ten or eleven I had to go to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> which had a <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">I would uh stay with a family during the weekend and come <span class="building">home</span>, uh during the week, and come <span class="building">home</span> during the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I wasn't a very good student. </sentence><sentence id="45">I was in fact a lousy student. </sentence><sentence id="46">I had problems all time and uh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what they could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade. </sentence><sentence id="47">And at one point in 1930 ... "37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to <span class="building">senior high school</span> and the decision was that I would said Dad. </sentence><sentence id="48">And I said and I wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="49">So he said you have to. </sentence><sentence id="50">So I said uh, I'll show you. </sentence><sentence id="51"><span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> at that time uh if one went or flunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll show you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin. </sentence><sentence id="52">And that was in 1937. </sentence><sentence id="53">And at that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to learn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">So I went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh <span class="building">machine factory</span> and uh then this uh possibility came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Can we hold it for a minute? </sentence><sentence id="79">Because this is a good place, I think, to ask about what it was like as a Jew in <span class="populated place">Trest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">What was it like growing up as a Jew, particularly since your family was as prominent as it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Obviously in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because everybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger <span class="populated place">cities</span> you could uh go pass by. </sentence><sentence id="85">So obviously in uh <span class="building">grade school</span> I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="86">And uh we uh lived across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">temple</span> and by that time uh the congregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody for the _ group every morning. </sentence><sentence id="87">So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning was not exactly what particularly I was interested in. </sentence><sentence id="88">But my grandfather, my mother's father, used to live with us. </sentence><sentence id="89">He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so he made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="90">But five crowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money. </sentence><sentence id="91">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: Was your family very religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Well, I mean at that time <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> had mostly religious. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was nothing in these uh little <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh and obviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least show that we behaved properly. </sentence><sentence id="106">And uh the congregation was very small and very together. </sentence><sentence id="107">And uh since most of the people from our <span class="populated place">town</span> already had been the first generation that have left the <span class="populated place">town</span> and for instance in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, there was a it is called, of <span class="populated place">Trest</span>  which had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the <span class="populated place">city</span> of the origin. </sentence><sentence id="108">Just like uh the USS. </sentence><sentence id="109">has more Irish than Irish has in its uh <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">And so people were always very loyal to the place where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all of them would come and visit. </sentence><sentence id="111">And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is called - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came from the <span class="region">eastern provinces</span> and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the western and eastern uh Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="112">By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews and there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that happened between the German in this <span class="country">country</span> and the Russian - I mean every major congregation in the <span class="country">U.S.</span> had these frictions. </sentence><sentence id="113">So that's uh basically the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="127">So as a young man then, you decided that <span class="building">high school</span> was not for you. </sentence><sentence id="128">You flunked Latin. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh and you became an apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="130">Tell us about being an apprentice with and what was it like"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Well, in - I was an apprentice in the <span class="spatial object">lathe</span>, uh <span class="spatial object">metal lathe</span> uh proposition and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: I don't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: <span class="spatial object">Lathe</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Oh, a <span class="spatial object">lathe</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with coffee and what have you and cleaning the uh <span class="building">shop</span> on Saturday afternoons. </sentence><sentence id="145">So one didn't learn a hell of a lot. </sentence><sentence id="146">But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh <span class="building">school</span> that by law one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational proposition so that was nice. </sentence><sentence id="147">On Thursdays one could be away from the <span class="building">factory</span> and uh learn something. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh the <span class="building">factory</span> had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh <span class="building">bakeries</span> and uh meat proposition - that was a very specialized <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And the <span class="building">factory</span> still exists. </sentence><sentence id="150">No longer in this <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> but now they make <span class="spatial object">agriculture machinery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">And last time we were there in Christmas it was a terrible mess. </sentence><sentence id="152">But, one at least saw that it existed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="163">So you were an apprentice, and what did you do next? </sentence><sentence id="164">What did you decide to do at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to <span class="populated place">Prague</span> for a little . . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: How did you become interested in this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Because I was always a uh Youth Aliyah, a Zionist, youth Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh that was the only thing that I was interested in <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Was there a large group of young Zionists in this <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I went to <span class="building">school</span> and to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: Can you describe what you did as a group, ..... Zionists ...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well it was just like uh like uh a <span class="building">youth group</span> would. </sentence><sentence id="181">And uh would go out on Saturdays and Sundays, and going out in to <span class="env feature">nature</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">My dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural. </sentence><sentence id="184">Except uh I was the only one that did something about it. </sentence><sentence id="185">My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh - well, it was this way. </sentence><sentence id="186">I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh American Jews that came from <span class="country">Poland</span> or from <span class="country">Russia</span> - some of them took and some of them didn't take an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="187">And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">Very important. </sentence><sentence id="189">And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always she couldn't get away from the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer and in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy. </sentence><sentence id="191">That was one of my problems that I, my dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="192">I told him very simple, because I am not my brother. </sentence><sentence id="193">But he was, uh he got a job in <span class="populated place">Anssuan</span> in electricity in <span class="country">Egypt</span> under the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother would never had anything with it. </sentence><sentence id="194">I mean they just said impossible to be that way,  <span class="dlf">farms</span> in <span class="country">Denmark</span> .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="230">OK. </sentence><sentence id="231">Tell me what happened?) </sentence><sentence id="232">By the time I was in this uh in this uh group of uh kids, it was just a question of when we could uh be uh exported to <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">By that time it was not uh my decision any more. </sentence><sentence id="234">I could of course have said in the last minute that I don't want to go but uh in October 1939, you just uh obviously you would immediately grab the opportunity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: What was October 1939 like in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="244">By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was, in September something. </sentence><sentence id="245">And things were, on the surface things were relatively normal. </sentence><sentence id="246">Of course uh the Jews were running around wondering how they could get out of the place. </sentence><sentence id="247">By that time of course uh for many of them it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="248">So the opportunity when grabbed. </sentence><sentence id="249">I mean it has never even occurred to me that I uh, that there was any alternative because that was uh a real opportunity to get away from my family. </sentence><sentence id="250">And since they were Zionists but didn't do much about it, I was the only one that did. </sentence><sentence id="251">As it turned out, I never eventually went to visit them (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: So you landed in <span class="country">Denmark</span> where did you go, where you have take... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I went to a little place then on the <span class="env feature">island</span> south of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> in a uh very small uh <span class="dlf">Danish farm</span>, very uh very uh missionaries... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: <span class="building">Missionaries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">And it was a small <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and I didn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="302">They didn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was cold and I had to uh go into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> in October and uh harvest sugar beets and things like that and for the first week it was pretty tough because still Sunday uh when they took me to the uh see the Danish minister, a Lutheran minister which spoke uh German, I really didn't have any way of uh communicate with them. </sentence><sentence id="304">But there were about uh ten or fifteen people that were in that <span class="region">region</span>, with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> get together, and we had a uh, a teacher who would go around and keep us together, so we had about one day a week to get together. </sentence><sentence id="305">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Did the people on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, uh the owners of the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, uh did they know you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Of course. </sentence><sentence id="315">I mean that was the whole proposition. </sentence><sentence id="316">And uh I on the second <span class="dlf">farm</span> that I went to I really became part of the family and uh and the boy and the girl really became my brothers and sisters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Tell me about that <span class="dlf">farm</span>? </sentence><sentence id="321">What were the people's names? </sentence><sentence id="322">What was the family like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Well, of course uh being Danes their name was Nielsen (ph) though you couldn't tell from anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="327">And it was uh, for me it was a uh small <span class="dlf">farm</span>, with very diversified agriculture - mostly uh dairy farming and pigs. </sentence><sentence id="328">This used to be uh the Danish export of cheese and uh butter and bacon. </sentence><sentence id="329">And uh in the good old days before World War II, they were bringing in feed from abroad, mostly from the <span class="country">United States</span>, and by that time it was cut off, so then the question was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very enthusiastic about about switching exports from <span class="country">England</span> which was now impossible, to feed  the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="330">So was difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: The family's were, was named Nielsen (ph) and you said you were very close to them. </sentence><sentence id="337">What kind of things did you do with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Well, everything that they did. </sentence><sentence id="341">I mean uh working, whatever needed to be done on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and of course they had small uh groups at that time uh - ten miles was a long ways and so there would be a community get-together around the <span class="building">church</span> and they would have uh invite uh neighbors for dinner, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="342">And I was always part of it. </sentence><sentence id="343">As any kid, part of the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Were you, can you - were you on this <span class="dlf">farm</span> when the Germans invaded <span class="country">Denmark</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

agriculture during uh when the snow was on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and they could uh utilize their time in going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">And the <span class="building">schools</span> were very small, about sixty, seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then had to uh work after the six months working on the uh <span class="building">agriculture school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had that <span class="building">agriculture school</span>, they had that <span class="building">agriculture school</span> they had a <span class="dlf">farm</span> and so I became the guy to take care of uh the hogs and the cows. </sentence><sentence id="377">It was of the few jobs in my life which I hated because uh I had to do it because I had to pay off for my uh <span class="building">school</span> and there was no way of getting away from it. </sentence><sentence id="378">It was lots of work so in <span class="populated place">Demmark</span> at that time one had to have a <span class="building">vocational school</span> of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the <span class="building">agriculture school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was part of the uh requirement so I had to have this <span class="building">vocational school</span> and uh the director of the <span class="building">school</span> had to give me a uh a uh a good uh (pause) well, he had to certify that I was at the <span class="building">school</span>, that I made OK and he just had me because I just had this uh, had to have this certificate. </sentence><sentence id="380">So that was in uh "42, late "42, early "43 and in uh the middle of 1943 I finally ended up starting in <span class="building">Agriculture College</span> at the <span class="building">University of Copenhagen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">I three years B.S.in Agronomy and uh it was in October, September, October "43 when uh I uh was a uh freshman and one day I got a call, not I but the President of the <span class="building">University</span> got a call in the morning telling me that he should tell me that the Gestapo was uh on my tail and uh my landlady said I should never come back <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="382">That was at the time when uh the Germans have gotten after the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh the Germans did it differently from what they have done in <span class="region">Central Europe</span> and <span class="country">Germany</span> where they uh got the Jews together in the center, in the <span class="building">center</span> and then they would put the Jews together before they were to export them to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">Uh in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, they couldn't get away with it because the Danes would object to it so the trick that the Germans did is uh picked the people at <span class="building">home</span> so that one wouldn't see anything in front of the rest of the uh population. </sentence><sentence id="385">It just so happened that uh there was a German naval attache at the uh German uh ambassador, <span class="building">embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> and he was friendly, knowing what uh was happening and let the Danish uh Prime Minister know what the Germans had in mind and that was on uh Yom Kippur and uh the Prime Minister let the Danish chief rabbi tell the people at Yom Kippur that go and tell them then to disappear because if they will be at <span class="building">home</span>, the Germans will pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="386">So most of the people, the seven million, seven thousand people, the Danish uh Jews, were disappeared and the <span class="interior space">underground</span> got them to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="387">I think only about five hundred or so got uh went to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>, most of them from our group because our group, uh we went, they distribute the Danish congregation so we really didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="388">And uh so then I  and tell him something and the President called me by name and I came from this <span class="building">theater</span>, took about a half a minute uh wondering what the hell did I do now. </sentence><sentence id="389">And so he said your landlady called, and don't come ever back again. </sentence><sentence id="390">So I happened to, about two or three <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from the <span class="building">university</span> where a uh Danish uh uh Lutheran reverend whose uh whose uh young boy was a very close friend of mine, and so I went to the <span class="building">church</span> and said what do I do now. </sentence><sentence id="391">So he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine. </sentence><sentence id="392">Take your <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, drive uh south of uh a little <span class="populated place">fishing village</span> south of the <span class="building">international headquarters</span> of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> and a lady will take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="393">And uh by that evening I was in uh <span class="country">Sweden</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: In <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">That's how easy it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Describe that trip. </sentence><sentence id="425">You were on your <span class="spatial object">bike</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">Where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Well, I left the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> with the lady and she took me uh at night uh to the little fishing uh <span class="dlf">port</span> and there was a tiny little <span class="spatial object">boat</span> for thirteen, there were thirteen people of us and they just took us over to uh to uh <span class="populated place">Malm6</span> and took about an hour and a half and it was October - very rought <span class="env feature">seas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">It was lots of people left there outside out, because the <span class="env feature">sea</span> was very rough, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="432">So by that time the Swedes already had uh uh prepared uh the need for putting the people together to uh take care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: What, as you were on your <span class="spatial object">bike</span> going to to meet this lady, what were you thinking? </sentence><sentence id="437">What were you ...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: Not very much. </sentence><sentence id="441">All I did is took my chemistry books - that's the only thing that I had and I didn't have a clue what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="442">And on the several days and months and years after I have found out what really was happening, that the Danes have taken care of their Jews. </sentence><sentence id="443">And that I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="444">And uh I still don't understand many of the things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="445">Everybody has his own stories, uh explanations, interpretation, and so uh by that time the Swedes already had their organization for uh taking care of the Danes and uh taking uh <span class="interior space">underground</span> has taken about two or three months to get all the Jews across to <span class="country">Sweden</span> and I was one of the earlier ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: What happened to you? </sentence><sentence id="453">What did you do when you landed in <span class="country">Sweden</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="457">There was a old <span class="building">grade school</span> where they put the people up and uh I went to see, the same evening I went to see uh uh "Gone With The Wind." </sentence><sentence id="458">And then I have read that book and was fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="459">And then a couple days after (cough) came some recruiter from some uh <span class="building">sugar factories</span> that needed people to harvest uh sugar beets and seemed like uh the work was pretty tough but they paid well so with a buddy of mine we went and signed or signed up and uh worked for about three weeks and then my buddy had a brillant idea. </sentence><sentence id="460">Said look, since we, since we are uh students from the <span class="building">Agriculture College</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> why don't we offer our services to the <span class="building">Agriculture College</span> in <span class="populated place">Upsala</span> (ph) in <span class="country">Sweden</span> where the agri... <span class="building">agi school</span> was  0 uh located. </sentence><sentence id="461">I thought it was a idiotic idea. </sentence><sentence id="462">Who needed us? </sentence><sentence id="463">But I thought OK, it was worth ten cents and low and behold they said come on over. </sentence><sentence id="464">So that's how we looked or came eventually back to the <span class="building">University of Upsala</span> and that I thought was really a good luck. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: What did you do there? </sentence><sentence id="475">What was your job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="478">A: Oh, I was uh working in a uh in a uh <span class="building">lab</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="479">Pause - technical conversation.) </sentence><sentence id="480">So I was uh working in a uh feed (ph) lab. </sentence><sentence id="481">But that's OK. </sentence><sentence id="482">Was and at that time it was much easier to send uh uh food packages to my family. </sentence><sentence id="483">By that time they already were in <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="491">Let's pause here. </sentence><sentence id="492">You're talking about your family. </sentence><sentence id="493">Had you been hearing from them all these years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="498">A: Yes, every week I had a letter about what they were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="500">Q: Tell us what was happening to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="502">A: Well, obviously uh the seven uh Jewish people in the in <span class="populated place">Trest</span> gradually uh had their jobs uh - they couldn't continue them. </sentence><sentence id="503">Finally they uh took them and concentrated them from fifteen or so <span class="building">houses</span> into little groups where the family would be able only to have uh two or three uh hou... places to get together. </sentence><sentence id="504">And every week or month there would be additional squeezing and uh people would have to give their <span class="building">houses</span> away and uh uh gradually would uh have to go to uh <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> and take a couple of thirty (ph) uh kilos (ph) that they could take along with them, and then they would be in <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> for uh about a year and that in October or September 1944 I would, I found out that they went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and that's the last I ever heard from my entire family. </sentence><sentence id="505">My uh grandfather and my uh mother's brother, my brother and his uh new uh he got married - the whole family just disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="506">That was about uh October "44. </sentence><sentence id="507">So after (cough) from <span class="country">England</span>, uh from uh <span class="country">Sweden</span> I eventually ended up in the Czech exile government uh Army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q: How did that ? </sentence><sentence id="515">How did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="516">This is October "44. </sentence><sentence id="517">You're...  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: Oh they uh went into some <span class="building">castle</span> in <span class="country">Scotland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="523">I didn't ever know where it was. </sentence><sentence id="524">So they debriefed us and then I went to the Czech Army and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Pardon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="532">Q: Where did they have the Czech army training? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: They had it uh near <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="535"><span class="region">South end</span> on the <span class="env feature">sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="536">And then after a little while they wanted uh uh the Royal Air Force needed some people that could speak English and Czech so I volunteered for that and for about uh over a year or year and a half I was in the Royal Air Force, in the Czech uh part of the <span class="building">Royal Air Force</span> and I since I didn't, already at that time I had problems with my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="537">The only thing I was good enough for was weather forecasting and they put someplace up in <span class="region">northern Scotland</span>, about thirty or forty miles north of <span class="populated place">Inverness</span>, and at that time by sheer chance and uh a captain that uh was in charge of uh education on the (cough) on the <span class="dlf">base</span> made it possible for me to finish my my uh <span class="building">high school</span> by writing or doing it by uh writing... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="543">I don't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: The <span class="building">Czech uh school</span> would uh, or the Czech exile government had a uh <span class="building">high school</span> for the kids uh that uh belonged to the uh Czech uh ministers of the government, and uh so the captain arranged for me to uh do uh my communication long-distance and uh so eventually I got my <span class="building">high school</span> degree. </sentence><sentence id="547">So uh that made it possible for me after World War II to to go back to the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">So then uh when the war was over in <span class="region">Central Europe</span> in May 1945 I uh went back to <span class="populated place">Prague</span> looking for my parents. </sentence><sentence id="549">By that time I thought maybe it would have been long enough time to, for them to come back, but they were not and uh a lady that was in uh in uh the <span class="interior space">mail room</span> in the little <span class="populated place">city</span> was a friend of our family's and she wrote to me and says, your folks have not come back and we have very small chances that they might be. </sentence><sentence id="550">So that was in uh May or June 1945. </sentence><sentence id="551">So that's the end of the story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: What did you do at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Well, I was uh, at that time I was in the <span class="building">Air Force</span>, and uh decided there was no purpose for me to go back to <span class="country">Czechslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="561">So I required to get to be uh taken (technical conversation), so I was demobilized in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> instead of in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, and so I was through in January "46 and immediately started going back to the <span class="building">University of uh agriculture</span>, the <span class="building">University of Copenhagen</span> and then the Danes of course took care of me just as if I were a Dane, and I got uh scholarship and all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="562">And then uh in part uh during the undergraduate work 1 uh worked as a uh uh a foreign correspondent to some Czech newspapers and did some work for the <span class="building">Ministry of Agriculture</span> in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="563">Enough to make a little extra. </sentence><sentence id="564">And so I went  2 back in 1948 when I graduated from <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> and the Communists came in." </sentence><sentence id="565">I went back to <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> and then eventually came to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
