<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: What did your parents do? </sentence><sentence id="23">What was your father's occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: My father was a photographer. </sentence><sentence id="27">He had his own <span class="interior space">studio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father died in February of 1925; I was obviously just a few months old. </sentence><sentence id="29">And my mother continued the business until 1938, December of 1938, when all <span class="building">Jewish businesses</span> had to be closed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="35">What was it like for you, until 1938, growing up in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Well, I would say that we had a very nice family life, in spite of not having a father. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother had three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="40">They were in <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">They were in <span class="building">haute couture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">And, it was really a very loving family. </sentence><sentence id="43">I had also my father's mother, my grandmother, who was a very elderly lady and our family life really was a very nice one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What kind of <span class="building">school</span> did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, I entered <span class="building">public school</span> like all children at age six, and I think I hated <span class="building">school</span> from the first day I went there. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was made ever more difficult, because the teacher we had was even then a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="54">And I was a child that couldn't sit still, and had my mouth open probably all the time. </sentence><sentence id="55">And was punished for it a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="56">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="57">It did not improve my love for <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: Did you have friends in <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="65">Were they Jewish friends? </sentence><sentence id="66">Christian friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I had a lot of friends in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">I think we were the only <span class="building">class</span>, <span class="building">first grade class</span>, at the time we were 24 children. </sentence><sentence id="72">Out of the 24, 12 were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="73">Fifty percent! </sentence><sentence id="74">It was an extremely high percentage. </sentence><sentence id="75">I think that was the only <span class="building">class</span> ever that had such a high percentage of Jewish  students. </sentence><sentence id="76">I went to <span class="building">public school</span> until 1936 when Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to <span class="building">public school</span> unless their parent or their fathers were in the First World War and were in the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">These were the exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="78">So I had to go to <span class="building">Jewish school</span> in 1936, and I went to this <span class="building">school</span> until Easter of 1940." </sentence><sentence id="79">So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnacht", due to the fact that we had so many Jewish -- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> for many weeks and months, <span class="building">school</span> was every other day two hours for many months until everybody had come back and there was a semblance of a normal <span class="building">school</span> day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, "34. </sentence><sentence id="93">How, besides <span class="building">school</span>, how did life change for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, I would first like to go back before 1933. </sentence><sentence id="97">We lived and had our <span class="building">business</span> next to a <span class="building">newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">This newspaper was a left-wing newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="99">And we had daily street fights, mob scenes, shooting, flag burning. </sentence><sentence id="100">These are the first of my memories as a child outside the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was a very violent <span class="dlf">street</span> we lived on. </sentence><sentence id="102">These are really my first memories and my mother or someone from the <span class="building">household</span> pulling me back from the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and as soon as they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> watching what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="103">These are really my first memories. </sentence><sentence id="104">One of my other memories is the boycott of April 1933 where our <span class="dlf">show windows</span> were plastered with "Jew!" " </sentence><sentence id="105">Don't go to the Jew!" </sentence><sentence id="106">And so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="107">These are really some of my childhood memories. </sentence><sentence id="108">Family life was great. </sentence><sentence id="109">Outside the family, it was not so good. </sentence><sentence id="110">You were insulted in the <span class="dlf">street</span> many times. </sentence><sentence id="111">You were called "dirty Jew," things like that. </sentence><sentence id="112">For several years, I did have Gentile girlfriends and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi time they could no longer associate with me, and I would not dare associate with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Were you taunted by your <span class="building">school</span> mates? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: By some of them. </sentence><sentence id="133">And like my husband, I beat up one. </sentence><sentence id="134">And not only did I beat her, I actually tore her sweater to pieces. </sentence><sentence id="135">I was not standing, you know, not letting it happen to me all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: As the Nazi regime went on, what else happened to you and your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht. [] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Tell me about that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Kristallnacht, I went to <span class="building">school</span> in the morning, <span class="building">Jewish school</span> obviously, and something seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="147">And when I came to <span class="building">school</span> and I mentioned that I saw the fire engines standing in front of a <span class="building">building</span> and in the back of this <span class="building">building</span> was the <span class="building">Orthodox synagogue</span>, I was told, "Don't you know what's going on?" </sentence><sentence id="148">And I said, "No, I don't." </sentence><sentence id="149">She said -- this one told me, "My father was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="150">His father was arrested, and it was just a terrible situation." </sentence><sentence id="151">The teachers, other than the female teachers, did not come in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="158">They were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="159">And they sent us <span class="building">home</span>, I think, after about two hours. </sentence><sentence id="160">And when I came <span class="building">home</span> all our <span class="dlf">show windows</span> had been smashed. </sentence><sentence id="161">My mother was sweeping up the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="163">To the taunts and harassment of the population or the people who were made to look like the population. </sentence><sentence id="164">Next to us was a <span class="building">store</span> that dealt in oriental carpets. </sentence><sentence id="165">The <span class="dlf">show window</span> is gone. </sentence><sentence id="166">Ink thrown over the <span class="spatial object">carpets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">It was, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="168">The only reason our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and <span class="building">business</span> was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to be arrested, so our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and our <span class="building">business</span> upstairs remained in tact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: What did your family do after Kristallnacht? </sentence><sentence id="181">How did you mother manage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Well, we managed first of all to take care of a lot of customers at the time because every Jew needed an identification paper. </sentence><sentence id="185">To these purpose, you had to have a picture. </sentence><sentence id="186">The picture had to show your left ear. </sentence><sentence id="187">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="188">So that every person had to be taken -- the picture had to be taken from this side. </sentence><sentence id="189">Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark. </sentence><sentence id="190">Another harassment. </sentence><sentence id="191">And so we were really very busy in the business until the very end, until we absolutely closed on the 31st of December. </sentence><sentence id="192">And, since I did not go to <span class="building">school</span> because there was no <span class="building">school</span>, I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, many times their first stop was really with us because they were so afraid they had to get the identification paper, the photos and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="193">I saw many men with their ears frozen, their hands frozen. </sentence><sentence id="194">My mother would run pots of soup to feed these people first before they would go wherever they needed, you know, went. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was a very hard, very busy time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: What happened after that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of my mother who also had to close their business moved in with us because we had a very large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Obviously, we shared the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Half was an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, half was business. </sentence><sentence id="213">So there were all these empty <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, so my aunts moved in with us because there was no more income so you had to reduce your living expenses. </sentence><sentence id="214">My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because she was very old. </sentence><sentence id="215">She could no longer keep a <span class="building">household</span> of her own. </sentence><sentence id="216">And so here were six women in one <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">Not necessarily an ideal situation, but it functioned somehow. </sentence><sentence id="218">When the war broke out <span class="populated place">Karlsruhe</span> was on the list of evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="219">In other words, most of the population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="220">And so we evacuated my grandmother, of all places, to <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And many people went to  <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span>, other places where they could go; my mother decided she was not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="222">And my mother's three sisters decided they were not going to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="223">We were going - - just going to stay where we were. </sentence><sentence id="224">My grandmother we sent to <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span> because it was very hard to move her in any emergency. </sentence><sentence id="225">She was 90 years old, and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months, and then we took her back because there was actually no war. </sentence><sentence id="226">There was war, but there was no shooting. </sentence><sentence id="227">There was nothing going on. </sentence><sentence id="228">So what then was called "Drdele de Guerre," and, and so we took her back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">This went, of course, until the day we were deported on the 22nd of October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="230">I would like to interject that in the spring of 1940 I was for four months in the area of <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>, where my mother had sent me, there was a <span class="building">school</span> -- <span class="building">boarding school</span> if you wish. </sentence><sentence id="231">It taught agriculture and horticulture and all sorts of things and my mother sent me up there because she didn't know what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="232">I was hanging around the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">There was nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="234">I could not do any apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up there for four months and, I think it was four months, maybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not feeling well. </sentence><sentence id="235">And so I came back. </sentence><sentence id="236">And then we, of course, were deported in October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Would you describe the process of that deportation? </sentence><sentence id="265">How were you notified and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: My mother went out shopping early in the morning, as a matter of fact, and she came <span class="building">home</span> in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the <span class="dlf">street</span> who told me that we would be deported. </sentence><sentence id="269">Said everybody would be arrested and deported." </sentence><sentence id="270">She did not believe it and she went to the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, which was only two blocks away from us. </sentence><sentence id="271">And sure enough the <span class="building">offices</span> were closed, and then it dawned on her that there was something to this story. </sentence><sentence id="272">And she came <span class="building">home</span> and she told me, "Well, I guess we better start packing." </sentence><sentence id="273">And before she had finished the sentence, the police was there and told us that we are arrested. </sentence><sentence id="274">No, the first thing she did was, "If we really have to go I have very good friends and I promised them certain items from our <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">Take them over there. </sentence><sentence id="276">Go over there. </sentence><sentence id="277">Take it, take it over there. </sentence><sentence id="278">Give it to them." </sentence><sentence id="279">And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really <span class="interior space">German underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">He was a lawyer, but he must have been busy in the <span class="building">German underground</span> because he knew exactly where we were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="281">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="282">The man was later on the mayor of <span class="populated place">Karlsruhe</span> right after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: What's his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: So he was, he was very clean. </sentence><sentence id="301">Was Mr. Veit. </sentence><sentence id="302">His name was Veit. </sentence><sentence id="303">They were very good friends of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="304">And so I took the items, and by the time I came back the police was in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> telling us to pack and, and so my mother started. </sentence><sentence id="305">And the policeman knew my mother very well. </sentence><sentence id="306">He was from the <span class="populated place">precinct</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a <span class="building">hospital</span> and you cannot be moved out of your <span class="interior space">apartment</span>  until I come back." </sentence><sentence id="308">Now he knew very well that no Jewish people were accepted at this particular day in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">So he gave us two hours to pack. </sentence><sentence id="310">So I packed everything for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="311">My mother packed for me and for herself and my aunts, of course, packed for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="312">And so six women were eventually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen. </sentence><sentence id="313">Six helpless women. </sentence><sentence id="314">Right! </sentence><sentence id="315">I was 16 and my grandmother was 91 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="316">Totally not comprehending what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="317">Not that she was senile. </sentence><sentence id="318">It was simply, it was something that was incomprehensible. </sentence><sentence id="319">And so we had to sign papers stating how much the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was worth. </sentence><sentence id="320">My aunt first refused and she was threatened that she would be sent to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, and so she signed. </sentence><sentence id="321">And we had to leave and we were loaded on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and taken to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> where everybody slowly was assembled. </sentence><sentence id="322">And I believe <span class="populated place">Karlsruhe</span> had some 930 or 950 Jews that were deported together. </sentence><sentence id="323">All together from <span class="populated place">Baden</span> and the <span class="region">Palatinate</span> and the <span class="region">Saar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">There were some Jews from the <span class="region">Saar</span> that were also deported with us, only a few. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was 6,500 people, I believe, that were deported to <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="326">The ride to <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was horror. </sentence><sentence id="327">It was absolute horror. </sentence><sentence id="328">My husband has explained to you, each <span class="spatial object">car</span> had a person in charge for each <span class="spatial object">car</span> and then someone was put in charge of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: Why was the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride a horror? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: It was a horror insofar as we had no food or barely any food was given to us. </sentence><sentence id="363">I think the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped in <span class="populated place">Mulhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">For the first time we were given some sort of soup and maybe some bread. </sentence><sentence id="365">Two of the old people, my grandmother being one of them, lost their minds. </sentence><sentence id="366">Most probably due to hunger and the strain and stress and eventually, there was a doctor on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, the last doctor that I knew in <span class="populated place">Karlsruhe</span> and he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother and I did. </sentence><sentence id="367">And it really meant, "Put her to sleep, let her go." </sentence><sentence id="368">She didn't. </sentence><sentence id="369">And at the end of the ride, when we came to <span class="populated place">Oloron-Sainte-Marie</span>; because she was totally confused. </sentence><sentence id="370">So was the other man, a Mr. Weil. </sentence><sentence id="371">She was taken out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and disappeared for at least a week. </sentence><sentence id="372">We did not know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="373">My mother offered to go, asked if she could go with this old woman and was refused. </sentence><sentence id="374">And for at least a week or two we did not know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="375">We never knew where she was. </sentence><sentence id="376">All of a sudden we were told that she was in the next <span class="dlf">block</span> in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">She must have been in a <span class="building">hospital</span> or someplace because when she came back, she was okay. </sentence><sentence id="378">She knew us. </sentence><sentence id="379">She could not understand her <span class="region">surroundings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="380">Obviously, who could? </sentence><sentence id="381">But she was okay. </sentence><sentence id="382">She was no longer confused. </sentence><sentence id="383">So you can understand that the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride, aside from everything else, was horror. </sentence><sentence id="384">My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the ages were great and having two people in the same <span class="spatial object">car</span>, not in the same <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but in the same <span class="spatial object">car</span> going -- losing their minds the same way was a little tough. </sentence><sentence id="385">When we arrived in <span class="populated place">Oloron- Sainte-Marie</span>, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets. </sentence><sentence id="386">It rained. </sentence><sentence id="387">It was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="388">We were loaded mostly on open <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">And in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> when we atrived, it was evening and, of course, total bedlam and confusion. </sentence><sentence id="390">And the adults, and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned barely. </sentence><sentence id="391"> And so it was on us, the young, to get some semblance of -- you can't say order -- but there was a <span class="building">barracks</span> where they were giving out straw. </sentence><sentence id="392">So we ran to get straw so the people at least could sleep on straw. </sentence><sentence id="393">My husband was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="394">He had even a <span class="spatial object">straw mattress</span> or whatever he called it. </sentence><sentence id="395">Later on, we were given stuff to put the straw in to make a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">But the first few nights we had straw and not even enough of that because some people really did sleep on the bare <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="397">And for the very old people it was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="398">A young person can always shift, but very old people, it is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="399">So it was the young people who had to function first and did function first. </sentence><sentence id="400">And slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern. </sentence><sentence id="401"><span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> full of <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">It was clay. </sentence><sentence id="403">When it rained, you sank into the <span class="env feature">clay</span> up to your knees. </sentence><sentence id="404">The first persons we lost, or one woman we lost really choked to death in the <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">She went at night to the <span class="interior space">latrine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="406">She fell. </sentence><sentence id="407">She could not extricate herself and she died. </sentence><sentence id="408">So our experiences were horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="409">It is not -- I would not say <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> was <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but it was what they called "the Little Hell before the Big One," meaning <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="410">Our food was minimal. </sentence><sentence id="411"><span class="country">France</span> was short on food, it is true. </sentence><sentence id="412">The French felt called upon to steal much of the money that was allocated to feed us so instead of the little, there was even less. </sentence><sentence id="413">There were people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> who stole -- were in a position to steal and did of this little food. </sentence><sentence id="414">So it was really a very difficult, difficult survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: I was in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> from, as I mentioned, October 25th, 1940 until the beginning of September 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: What happened--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: My grandmother -- excuse me -- died in January of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="475">My mother's oldest sister died in February of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="476">These are the two people that are buried in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="842">We don't know what that is, but would you rather have a glass of wine." </sentence><sentence id="843">And we in the <span class="interior space">closet</span> hoped they would say no, because it was a little bit tight in this <span class="spatial object">armoire</span> and so eventually they left and we could come out. </sentence><sentence id="844">So we were very, very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="845">And four weeks later, we came back to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="846">The <span class="spatial object">razzias</span> had stopped for the moment and it also helped me to make up my mind. </sentence><sentence id="847">Even before that actually, when I came back from <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> after I saw my mother that as safe as <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> is, we need to get out. </sentence><sentence id="848">We need to get out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="849">And I told my friends and I told the young people in the <span class="building">student home</span> <span class="building">Les Roches</span>"". </sentence><sentence id="850">There were some friends of my husband there; there was a map on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and I said, "You see where we are here and this is where we have to go," pointing to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and they looked at me like I had lost my mind. </sentence><sentence id="851">And I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="852">We cannot stay. </sentence><sentence id="853">No matter what, we cannot stay." </sentence><sentence id="854">And so eventually, I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

No, you cannot understand what emotions you are going through, and I came back to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their parents had been deported at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="919">And within -- I don't know whether it -- I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days later but it doesn't really matter. </sentence><sentence id="920">There was a get together and I believe -- I cannot be sure anymore -- it might have been in the <span class="building">Ceteau Fleuri</span> where Pastor Boegner addressed the people who were there and I went there. </sentence><sentence id="921">I don't remember who went with me. </sentence><sentence id="922">It is sort of a blank. </sentence><sentence id="923">He was telling us we should be calm and confident and nothing is going to happen and so on and so forth and after having had the experience that I just had, I just became very angry and I confronted the man and said, "Instead of telling us these things, why don't you do something? </sentence><sentence id="924">Rather than talking, do something." </sentence><sentence id="925">I did not know at the time who Pastor Boegner was. </sentence><sentence id="926">He was just another man. </sentence><sentence id="927">A man who was giving a speech that to me was totally ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="928">And so I confronted him with that. </sentence><sentence id="929">And I don't think if I had known who Pastor Boegner was, I think I would still have done the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
