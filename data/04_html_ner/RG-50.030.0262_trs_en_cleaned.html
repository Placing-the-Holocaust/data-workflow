<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="55">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was -- the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed -- it was separated. </sentence><sentence id="56">You see, everybody that they shipped from <span class="country">Germany</span> they shipped to the <span class="populated place">Latvian ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">Families came from <span class="country">Germany</span>, from <span class="country">Poland</span>, from different places. </sentence><sentence id="58">They were separated from us. </sentence><sentence id="59">They split the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">And there was a small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because <span class="country">Latvia</span> was not a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">They took the very worst <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, like, and they made it into a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> by wiring around it. </sentence><sentence id="62">Now, we were happy as long as we were together. </sentence><sentence id="63">But, we lived now in two <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, three families. </sentence><sentence id="64">At that time, we were four children and my mother and father. </sentence><sentence id="65">Then when we went to work, in that place, for the SS men, one day I heard that when we go back, there is going to be massive killing of all the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> people. </sentence><sentence id="66">Because they were bringing in more and more <span class="spatial object">trains</span> from other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">So, naturally, we wanted to be with our loved ones, but we also wanted to save ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now, by the end of the day, get picked out the oldest people, the weakest people. </sentence><sentence id="69">My youth helped me. </sentence><sentence id="70">And I knew somebody who was like a foreman. </sentence><sentence id="71">He was Jewish, too. </sentence><sentence id="72">But he was the one who relayed the messages from the SS men to us. </sentence><sentence id="73">They didn't speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="74">He spoke to us. </sentence><sentence id="75">And he was influential enough to put me aside, with another few people. </sentence><sentence id="76">And not turn me back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">Because that meant death. </sentence><sentence id="78">Now, the emotion that I had, to go back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, was very, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="79">At this point I couldn't make up my mind. </sentence><sentence id="80">And it wasn't a question of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="81">He saved me. </sentence><sentence id="82">He was alive until recently. </sentence><sentence id="83">I saw him, and I thanked him, again, and again, and again. </sentence><sentence id="84">So we knew that that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="85">And new people were brought in, from other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">What they did, they left us in that place and I worked there. </sentence><sentence id="87">And I lived there. </sentence><sentence id="88">But we were very few lucky ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Tell me in that incident, who was the man, and how old were you, and where were your brothers, or did you know where your brothers were, and who kept you from going back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Now, what happened was, I was still the same age, because it didn't take that long in <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">Maybe I had reached the age of 15, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="128">They heard that all the people who were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the Latvian Jews and whoever lived in that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were brought to a mass -- in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">And they had big, tremendous <span class="dlf">grave</span> dug out, where they shot them, threw them into the <span class="dlf">grave</span>, with shovels. </sentence><sentence id="130">And some of them were not killed by the bullet, were still alive. </sentence><sentence id="131">And they were thrown into that same <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">And then they put the dirt over them. </sentence><sentence id="133">And even the ones that were alive was killed. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I found out -- I found that out afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was railroad man, the man that used to control the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> closing and opening -- he witnessed this thing. </sentence><sentence id="136">And he said -- he was not Jewish, he just lived there. </sentence><sentence id="137">And he said, "I will never, ever be able to shut out the scenes and the horrors that the people that were trying to save themselves, and couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="138">I cannot sleep. </sentence><sentence id="139">I cannot get it out of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="140">It is very difficult for me, which is very much -- to understand how it really affected a man who was totally removed from it. </sentence><sentence id="141">After that, when they killed everybody in that massive <span class="dlf">grave</span>, they  liquidated the place where I was working. </sentence><sentence id="142">And they said they were going to send us to <span class="country">Germany</span>, to a beautiful place. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were very few. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: The man who saved you, what was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: His name was Aaronson (ph.). </sentence><sentence id="165">He was actually, in normal times, he was a cellist, a very well-known cellist. </sentence><sentence id="166">And he was in charge, like I said, to relay the messages, between the SS men and us. </sentence><sentence id="167">And his name was , which was his stage name. </sentence><sentence id="168">But it was  pregnant, because she came into the picture later on. </sentence><sentence id="169">And she was pregnant, and the SS women knew that she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="170">And she gave birth. </sentence><sentence id="171">And we all listened. </sentence><sentence id="172">And we heard how she cried, and how the baby was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="173">And she delivered it herself. </sentence><sentence id="174">And one of the SS women actually helped her. </sentence><sentence id="175">Then they made a little <span class="dlf">partition</span>, and they put that baby where we could hear it. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was a little girl. </sentence><sentence id="177">And they allowed her to breast feed the baby. </sentence><sentence id="178">And then, when the baby was two weeks old, they told her, she can't breast feed the baby anymore. </sentence><sentence id="179">She had to let the baby die. </sentence><sentence id="180">And we all died with it. </sentence><sentence id="181">I mean, that was so horrible. </sentence><sentence id="182">We listened, the baby was crying, and crying, and crying. </sentence><sentence id="183">And no food was given to her, and she died. </sentence><sentence id="184">And we had to comfort the mother. </sentence><sentence id="185">We were a lot of women in that <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">But were all like one, all like one. </sentence><sentence id="187">Now comes the picture, where I -- we were starved. </sentence><sentence id="188">We were under-nourished, with rashes on our bodies. </sentence><sentence id="189">We were shaved. </sentence><sentence id="190">I had a rash that covered my entire body. </sentence><sentence id="191">And I was in agony. </sentence><sentence id="192">But you can take a lot of pain, when you are young. </sentence><sentence id="193">Now, the SS women were very cruel. </sentence><sentence id="194">They were crueler than the SS men. </sentence><sentence id="195">We had no <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">We had -- we did not have a period, because they gave us something in the so-called soup. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was given to us once a day. </sentence><sentence id="198">Even the circumstances that we lived in, we had no periods. </sentence><sentence id="199">So that eliminated about how can we protect ourselves, if we don't have a period? </sentence><sentence id="200">And they dug a long narrow <span class="dlf">strip</span> outside, with a <span class="spatial object">board</span> across. </sentence><sentence id="201">That was our <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, outside. </sentence><sentence id="202">And there were days when it was like 30 below zero. </sentence><sentence id="203">We had to go and pull our clothing off. </sentence><sentence id="204">It freezing, just freezing. </sentence><sentence id="205">But things were so sad that -- we were young, and we sat in those <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, and I sang. </sentence><sentence id="206">I sang all kinds of songs. </sentence><sentence id="207">And then this SS woman came in, and she says -- she took the black -- I don't know what you call it, but the policemen wear it. </sentence><sentence id="208">The black stick, the black -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: <span class="spatial object">Nightstick</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yeah, and she beat. </sentence><sentence id="257">And she said, "You have it so good that you sing?" </sentence><sentence id="258">Because you never answered an SS woman. </sentence><sentence id="259">Then she remembered that I sang. </sentence><sentence id="260">And every time they took us out to be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired. </sentence><sentence id="261">And it was beastly cold, in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="262">They counted us. </sentence><sentence id="263">They chased us in, back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">And anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no matter what they asked. </sentence><sentence id="265">Can you sew? </sentence><sentence id="266">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="267">Can you clean? </sentence><sentence id="268">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="269">Can you go there? </sentence><sentence id="270">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="271">Can you go pick up the soup for the <span class="building">barracks</span>? </sentence><sentence id="272">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="273">I always went. </sentence><sentence id="274">Then you be better. </sentence><sentence id="275">Then you be better than any other prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="276">Maybe there were three or four more. </sentence><sentence id="277">And then they made the Jewish men into capos. </sentence><sentence id="278">They called them capos. </sentence><sentence id="279">And they put a band around their arms. </sentence><sentence id="280">And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the <span class="building">barracks</span> as fast as possible, to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="281">That was their pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="282">The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler said, "We don't have to kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="283">The Jews will kill each other." </sentence><sentence id="284">And in circumstances like that, that is exactly what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="285">Those few guys who were the capos, they took a bigger piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="286">They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us what we were entitled to, because we were so starved. </sentence><sentence id="287">We were swollen from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="288">My legs were twice, three times the size. </sentence><sentence id="289">And one day, there was a <span class="populated place">men's camp</span> further out. </sentence><sentence id="290">And in order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big <span class="spatial object">kettle</span>, like, where the soup was in, they had to go to the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span> to reach the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">And somebody hollered out to me, "Sonja, I just saw one of your brothers." </sentence><sentence id="292">And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was, one of my brothers, in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="293">It was the most unbelievable happening. </sentence><sentence id="294">And there  was this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall. </sentence><sentence id="295">And she was the meanest, meanest, most horrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon. </sentence><sentence id="296">She took me and she said again, you have it too good. </sentence><sentence id="297">You just made contact with the men. </sentence><sentence id="298">And I said to her, "This was my brother." </sentence><sentence id="299">And it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="300">They never hit us in the middle of the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">They always put us against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">And then she slammed my face. </sentence><sentence id="303">She knocked my teeth out. </sentence><sentence id="304">And also you got like a back knock, at the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">That was the purpose of the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">So you get a double pain. </sentence><sentence id="307">And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="308">I just laid there. </sentence><sentence id="309">And it didn't bother her. </sentence><sentence id="310">And she just walked away. </sentence><sentence id="311">And she says, " Now you're going to know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody." </sentence><sentence id="312">And we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="313">And that actually was not a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">That actually was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that they took us out and brought us to an <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, where we used to -- it was a huge place. </sentence><sentence id="315">They made the bombs for -- the large bombs. </sentence><sentence id="316">And we were making them. </sentence><sentence id="317">I was <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> with the women. </sentence><sentence id="318">And <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> were the men. </sentence><sentence id="319">And there again, I knew, my God, I was <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">And I was lucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles. </sentence><sentence id="321">I was lucky enough that they asked, in that <span class="building">factory</span>, "Who can speak German fluently?" </sentence><sentence id="322">And I said, "I can." </sentence><sentence id="323">And I was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">The Hungarian girls came in later on in the War, because <span class="country">Hungary</span> was not <span class="spatial object">jet</span> included. </sentence><sentence id="325">And I relayed the message, what they had to do next, whether he had complaints about anybody. </sentence><sentence id="326">We were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength. </sentence><sentence id="327">We couldn't work on those <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">They were big, huge <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">So, they put a white band on my arm, and they always used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German, between the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did not speak German. </sentence><sentence id="330">And he was actually nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="331">And he threw slices of bread under the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, as he passed by, because he had to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="332">Once I got those extra few slices of bread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally. </sentence><sentence id="333">But how do I get to my brother? </sentence><sentence id="334">I cannot go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the orders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="336">And I said to him, "You know what you did was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="337">And being as you are so wonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?" </sentence><sentence id="338">And he says, "Yes, I will. " </sentence><sentence id="339">He made me take a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="340">He put it in my arms, and says follow me. </sentence><sentence id="341">And he got me down to the <span class="interior space">lower level</span>, where my brother was working. </sentence><sentence id="342">And that was called the ; which meant that when the bomb was made <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, they had to use very hot <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, to finish it off. </sentence><sentence id="343">I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120 degrees in there. </sentence><sentence id="344">And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was. </sentence><sentence id="345">And he stood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him. </sentence><sentence id="346">And I threw that bread under that <span class="spatial object">machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">And my brother got the bread. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I did it as often as I could. </sentence><sentence id="349">But that was still while we were working. </sentence><sentence id="350">Now, we were shipped to another <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: What was that <span class="populated place">camp</span> called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: We didn't know, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="449">But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="450">And they just sent us to there, through another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which was called . </sentence><sentence id="451"> out, which meant they were going to be burned in the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">So, knowing that at any time they were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women. </sentence><sentence id="453">And they said to each other, a &gt;&gt;" which means later. </sentence><sentence id="454">They are not going to take you now. </sentence><sentence id="455">But they didn't say it in that many words. </sentence><sentence id="456">So I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="457">I figured this was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="458">How long is this going to last? </sentence><sentence id="459">Because we were getting less, and less every day. </sentence><sentence id="460">They were eliminating, they were lulling. </sentence><sentence id="461">They were awaiting for new shipments. </sentence><sentence id="462">And also in this <span class="spatial object">shipments</span> (sic.) </sentence><sentence id="463">came with the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">They were all told they could take their personal belongings. </sentence><sentence id="465">Everybody thought they were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing, and maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of the hardest. </sentence><sentence id="466">Now, we had to go to those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and we had to -- they had to throw out their belongings, their valise. </sentence><sentence id="467">And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis helped themselves to it. </sentence><sentence id="468">And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="469">But they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="470">So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third. </sentence><sentence id="471">I also was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="472">They had a lot of vigor. </sentence><sentence id="473">They were never afraid. </sentence><sentence id="474">Before that <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, when we were sent out to work, they made contact, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="475">And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace, a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="476">And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire -- all of us, coming in from work, to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they looked all over and they said, "You will tell us who is bringing in what. </sentence><sentence id="477">And if you don't, we're going to put you outside, and we are going to pour water over you. </sentence><sentence id="478">You are going to be on your knees. </sentence><sentence id="479">And you will freeze to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>." </sentence><sentence id="480">Which we did. </sentence><sentence id="481">We all went out, the way they chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="482">He had us on our knees. </sentence><sentence id="483">It was late at night. </sentence><sentence id="484">It was bitter cold. </sentence><sentence id="485">It was way below zero. </sentence><sentence id="486">And they poured pails of water over our bodies. </sentence><sentence id="487">And we froze to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">We could not lift our legs up. </sentence><sentence id="489">But none of us told them who brought that piece of bread in. </sentence><sentence id="490">None of us. </sentence><sentence id="491">And they saw, the following morning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone. </sentence><sentence id="492">Because they saw they were dealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we were still going into work. </sentence><sentence id="493">I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were going into, every day, to work. </sentence><sentence id="494">Now -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
