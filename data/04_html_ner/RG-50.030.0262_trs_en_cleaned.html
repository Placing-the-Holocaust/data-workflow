<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: <span class="spatial object">Nightstick</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yeah, and she beat. </sentence><sentence id="430">And she said, "You have it so good that you sing?" </sentence><sentence id="431">Because you never answered an SS woman. </sentence><sentence id="432">Then she remembered that I sang. </sentence><sentence id="433">And every time they took us out to be counted, which was four in the morning, twelve at night, any time they desired. </sentence><sentence id="434">And it was beastly cold, in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="435">They counted us. </sentence><sentence id="436">They chased us in, back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="437">And anything that we could get to be busy with -- I personally always lifted my arm, no matter what they asked. </sentence><sentence id="438">Can you sew? </sentence><sentence id="439">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="440">Can you clean? </sentence><sentence id="441">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="442">Can you go

</sentence><sentence id="446">I always went. </sentence><sentence id="447">Then you be better. </sentence><sentence id="448">Then you be better than any other prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="449">Maybe there were three or four more. </sentence><sentence id="450">And then they made the Jewish men into capos. </sentence><sentence id="451">They called them capos. </sentence><sentence id="452">And they put a band around their arms. </sentence><sentence id="453">And they had to hit us, chase us, hit us, get us out of the <span class="building">barracks</span> as fast as possible, to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="454">That was their pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="455">The Jewish boy that was concentrated there, like Hitler said, "We don't have to kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="456">The Jews will kill each other." </sentence><sentence id="457">And in circumstances like that, that is exactly what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="458">Those few guys who were the capos, they took a bigger piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="459">They took another dish of soup, which deprived us of having us what we were entitled to, because we were so starved. </sentence><sentence id="460">We were swollen from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="461">My legs were twice, three times the size. </sentence><sentence id="462">And one day, there was a <span class="populated place">men's camp</span> further out. </sentence><sentence id="463">And in order for them to get their rations of food, which was a big <span class="spatial object">kettle</span>, like, where the soup was in, they had to go to the <span class="populated place">women's camp</span> to reach the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">And somebody hollered out to me, "Sonja, I just saw one of your brothers." </sentence><sentence id="465">And I ran out and I screamed at him, and it was, one of my brothers, in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="466">It was the most unbelievable happening. </sentence><sentence id="467">And there  was this one SS woman, she was over six feet tall. </sentence><sentence id="468">And she was the meanest, meanest, most horrible human being anybody can imagine -- even Napoleon. </sentence><sentence id="469">She took me and she said again, you have it too good. </sentence><sentence id="470">You just made contact with the men. </sentence><sentence id="471">And I said to her, "This was my brother." </sentence><sentence id="472">And it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="473">They never hit us in the middle of the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">They always put us against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">And then she slammed my face. </sentence><sentence id="476">She knocked my teeth out. </sentence><sentence id="477">And also you got like a back knock, at the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">That was the purpose of the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">So you get a double pain. </sentence><sentence id="480">And she beat me until I just fell down and I just couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="481">I just laid there. </sentence><sentence id="482">And it didn't bother her. </sentence><sentence id="483">And she just walked away. </sentence><sentence id="484">And she says, " Now you're going to know you will never, ever make any motions to anybody." </sentence><sentence id="485">And we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="486">And that actually was not a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="487">That actually was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that they took us out and brought us to an <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, where we used to -- it was a huge place. </sentence><sentence id="488">They made the bombs for -- the large bombs. </sentence><sentence id="489">And we were making them. </sentence><sentence id="490">I was <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> with the women. </sentence><sentence id="491">And <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> were the men. </sentence><sentence id="492">And there again, I knew, my God, I was <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">And I was lucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles. </sentence><sentence id="494">I was lucky enough that they asked, in that <span class="building">factory</span>, "Who can speak German fluently?" </sentence><sentence id="495">And I said, "I can." </sentence><sentence id="496">And I was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="497">The Hungarian girls came in later on in the War, because <span

always used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German, between the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did not speak German. </sentence><sentence id="503">And he was actually nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="504">And he threw slices of bread under the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, as he passed by, because he had to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="505">Once I got those extra few slices of bread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally. </sentence><sentence id="506">But how do I get to my brother? </sentence><sentence id="507">I cannot go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="508">So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the orders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="509">And I said to him, "You know what you did was wonderful.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="619">Q: What was that <span class="populated place">camp</span> called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="621">A: We didn't know, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="622">But we landed in and they were putting numbers on the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="623">And they just sent us to there, through another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which was called : And that was a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">There was no work. </sentence><sentence id="625">There was no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="626">There was just -- every day was elimination. </sentence><sentence id="627">They counted us. </sentence><sentence id="628">One, two, three, out. </sentence><sentence id="629">One, two, out. </sentence><sentence id="630">One, four,  out, which meant they were going to be burned in the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">So, knowing that at any time they were about to pick me, they knew me, the SS women. </sentence><sentence id="632">And they said to each other, a &gt;&gt;" which means later. </sentence><sentence id="633">They are not going to take you now. </sentence><sentence id="634">But they didn't say it in that many words. </sentence><sentence id="635">So I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="636">I figured this was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="637">How long is this going to last? </sentence><sentence id="638">Because we were getting less, and less every day. </sentence><sentence id="639">They were eliminating, they were lulling. </sentence><sentence id="640">They were awaiting for new shipments. </sentence><sentence id="641">And also in this <span class="spatial object">shipments</span> (sic.) </sentence><sentence id="642">came with the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">They were all told they could take their personal belongings. </sentence><sentence id="644">Everybody thought they were going live, so their personal belongings consisted of shoes, and a little clothing, and maybe even a little bit of jewelry, thinking that they were going to buy themselves out of the hardest. </sentence><sentence id="645">Now, we had to go to those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and we had to -- they had to throw out their belongings, their valise. </sentence><sentence id="646">And we had to open them, and sort them out, where the Nazis helped themselves to it. </sentence><sentence id="647">And it was just people who were coming -- coming to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="648">But they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="649">So, that was the second most horrible thing in my life, or the third. </sentence><sentence id="650">I also was very happy that I was with the Polish girls, the Jewish Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="651">They had a lot of vigor. </sentence><sentence id="652">They were never afraid. </sentence><sentence id="653">Before that <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, when we were sent out to work, they made contact, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="654">And they used to bring in, either between their legs, or someplace, a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="655">And they got -- they heard of it, the SS men, and they stopped the entire -- all of us, coming in from work, to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they looked all over and they said, "You will tell us who is bringing in what. </sentence><sentence id="656">And if you don't, we're going to put you outside, and we are going to pour water over you. </sentence><sentence id="657">You are going to be on your knees. </sentence><sentence id="658">And you will freeze to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>." </sentence><sentence id="659">Which we did. </sentence><sentence id="660">We all went out, the way they chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="661">He had us on our knees. </sentence><sentence id="662">It was late at night. </sentence><sentence id="663">It was bitter cold. </sentence><sentence id="664">It was way below zero. </sentence><sentence id="665">And they poured pails of water over our bodies. </sentence><sentence id="666">And we froze to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">We could not lift our legs up. </sentence><sentence id="668">But none of us told them who brought that piece of bread in. </sentence><sentence id="669">None of us. </sentence><sentence id="670">And they saw, the following morning, they got us up, somehow, and they left us alone. </sentence><sentence id="671">Because they saw they were dealing with something that they feel it isn't important enough yet, to kill them, because we were still going into work. </sentence><sentence id="672">I jumped my report to you, because that was still when we were going into, every day, to work. </sentence><sentence id="673">Now -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: Was that at the first <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: It wasn't the first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: It was the one you came to with the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and the <span class="spatial object">train</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: Right, that was -- that was . </sentence><sentence id="735">No, it wasn't <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="736">That was . </sentence><sentence id="737">And we had -- now one day, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung. </sentence><sentence id="738">And myself, two more girls, and three guys. </sentence><sentence id="739">Because they thought I brought something into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, like food, or something. </sentence><sentence id="740">And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="741">You are going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="742">You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all the prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one of you, if you date brig anything into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw beet, that we found in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="743">So, it was another miracle. </sentence><sentence id="744">As it happened, my brother walked by, and he saw. </sentence><sentence id="745">I was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="746">And he knew I was going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="747">But, as  luck wanted it, there was an SS man, from <span class="country">Latvia</span>, who came to oversee how they can torture more and take a lesson, the way <span class="country">Germany</span> had their <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="748">That Latvian SS man knew who I was, that I was in his <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="country">Latvia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked him to save me, and somehow it worked. </sentence><sentence id="750">He saved me. </sentence><sentence id="751">The others were hung. </sentence><sentence id="752">And he saved me. </sentence><sentence id="753">He told the other SS men not to kill me. </sentence><sentence id="754">And it was like God sent somebody to take this person, to live, which was another miracle. </sentence><sentence id="755">And we were in the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">And they were going to -- they were going to give us a well-known <span class="interior space">shower</span>, which was -- we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="757">They told us they were going to give us a regular <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">We have not had <span class="interior space">showers</span> or <span class="interior space">baths</span> or anything, or toilet paper, or anything. </sentence><sentence id="759">So, they chased us into a <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="760">We were totally naked. </sentence><sentence id="761">They put up a <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="762">It was like a <span class="spatial object">fashion show table</span>, like a <span class="interior space">runway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="763">And we had to walk naked on that <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="764">And the SS men -- they sat on both sides, and they looked at our bodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed. </sentence><sentence id="765">I had this horrible rash, that I knew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and dirt. </sentence><sentence id="766">Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair. </sentence><sentence id="767">And I hid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't show how bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="768">Then came the other miracle. </sentence><sentence id="769">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="770">And to the right was the <span class="interior space">showers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="771">To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going. </sentence><sentence id="772">But as they -- as we stood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we didn't know what way they were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="773">We knew they were screaming because they were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="774">And that was with the gas. </sentence><sentence id="775">It came out of <span class="spatial object">shower heads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="776">Later we saw, when the <span class="dlf">doors</span> opened, there were ten <span class="spatial object">shower heads</span>, many of them over the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="777">And turned on the gas, and by the time they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I peeked in, we all peeked in, all of them were dead on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">That was a sight. </sentence><sentence id="779">That was just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="780">That was worse than the <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was going to hit them, until -- just screaming. </sentence><sentence id="781">They inhaled the gas. </sentence><sentence id="782">And I was saved again. </sentence><sentence id="783">I was alive, still. </sentence><sentence id="784">When we were shipped to that <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, like I told you before, we did not know when the end was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="785">But, we did not lose our hopes. </sentence><sentence id="786">Because we thought, why isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us? </sentence><sentence id="787">We thought that President Roosevelt was our savior. </sentence><sentence id="788">We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us. </sentence><sentence id="789">Nobody saved us. </sentence><sentence id="790">There was no way for anybody to be saved. </sentence><sentence id="791">And we knew we were going to die, which, at that time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="792">We had no -- nobody, I didn't know, except for the one brother. </sentence><sentence id="793">We didn't know if they would come out dead or alive. </sentence><sentence id="794">But every morning at ten o'clock, <span class="spatial object">planes</span> were coming down, very low. </sentence><sentence id="795">And always circling around the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, which I later found out, that was the <span class="building">American Amny</span>, taking pictures, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="796">They knew that was a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="797">And they were trying to bomb the <span class="populated place">city</span>, but to avoid bombing the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, which actually was the case. </sentence><sentence id="798">They did not bomb the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="799">One day they chased us out, and they said that we had to go and pick something up. </sentence><sentence id="800">I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned women who did the food -- picking up the food. </sentence><sentence id="801">And as we went to pick up the food, we saw on the other side of the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there. </sentence><sentence id="802">They absolutely devoured it. </sentence><sentence id="803">We grabbed it. </sentence><sentence id="804">We ate it. </sentence><sentence id="805">It was pink. </sentence><sentence id="806">It tasted like the most wonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the hunger alone. </sentence><sentence id="807">It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards the end. </sentence><sentence id="808">How we got that information, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="809">I don't know how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="810">Now,  the SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men. </sentence><sentence id="811">And there was no <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="812">The <span class="populated place">city</span> was totally bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="813">There were no lights, no radio. </sentence><sentence id="814">They did not have <span class="spatial object">radios</span> like today, with batteries. </sentence><sentence id="815">So, I entertained the SS men. </sentence><sentence id="816">They wanted somebody to give them music. </sentence><sentence id="817">So, they used to get me out of my <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="818">And they used to take me in, and put me behind a <span class="dlf">curtain</span>, or behind a piece of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="819">And I used to stand for them, and sing for them, German songs, which was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="820">I thought it was the greatest thing, because that would give me more life, which it did. </sentence><sentence id="821">It actually did. </sentence><sentence id="822">It actually -- every, like I said -- every time they counted for the others, they always put me aside. </sentence><sentence id="823">It was very good. </sentence><sentence id="824">It was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="825">But they had no mercy. </sentence><sentence id="826">They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what happens, that we are all going to go. </sentence><sentence id="827">End of Tape #1  Tape #2

</sentence><sentence id="1489">The first thing I did -- we did, is as we were crawling in there we saw about -- I don't know how many feet away it was, one <span class="building">building</span> -- a little <span class="building">building</span> remained, and it was not bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And it was a <span class="building">cleaning store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So, my brothers broke the <span class="dlf">window</span> down, and the other guys, and got the clothing from the <span class="building">cleaning store</span>, and we eliminated our striped clothes, and put on the clothes that didn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="1492">But it did not matter. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And we waited. </sentence><sentence id="1494">And while we were in that <span class="interior space">basement</span>, we had heard that the Americans were already in that <span class="populated place">city</span>, so we took up the guys to walk out, and walk in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And as we walked in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, American soldiers came to us. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And they saw that we were shaved, and the men wore -- they called it , which was skinny bodies, skinny arms, and fat legs from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And one was a German Jew, who was an officer in the American Army, and he said to us, what language do you speak, in German? </sentence><sentence id="1498">Naturally, we all jumped on him, because we all spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And he immediately organized for the soldiers to go back to their place, where they were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And within half and hour or so, they brought us all their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for. </sentence><sentence id="1501">I hadn't brushed my teeth for years. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1503">I mean he did not eat -- now I know it was a big <span class="building">Hershey bar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And you know how it is cut? </sentence><sentence id="1505">We ate little crumbs of it, so it would last longer. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And -- before we walked out, the German found out that there were Jews hiding in that <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1507">Now we hear them. </sentence><sentence id="1508">And how can we hide from them? </sentence><sentence id="1509">So, it was like a little <span class="interior space">cubby</span>, with <span class="dlf">steps</span> originally going up, and underneath is always a little <span class="interior space">cubby</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1510">And we all crawled into that <span class="interior space">cubby</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1511">And we did not breathe. </sentence><sentence id="1512">So the did not hear us. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And they said in German, "We knew there are Jews here, but where are they?" </sentence><sentence id="1514">And they walked out, luckily. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And when we walked out, we met the American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1516">Now, the rest of our group found out that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> is empty, but there is some food, some food. </sentence><sentence id="1517">So they went back there to get the food. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And they were caught, because the Nazis came back. </sentence><sentence id="1519">It was not quite over. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And I told my brothers, we are not going back. </sentence><sentence id="1521">We are staying right here. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who we were with, because they thought the war was still not over. </sentence><sentence id="1524">That particular <span class="populated place">city</span> was not liberated for them, yet. </sentence><sentence id="1525">So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And we'll be walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot,  6 because that would kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1528">It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we were so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food. </sentence><sentence id="1529">And I did it for my brothers, as well. </sentence><sentence id="1530">And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them overate. </sentence><sentence id="1531">They ate too much. </sentence><sentence id="1532">There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes, which was like cake. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we tried to find the place where to live. </sentence><sentence id="1534">And start to work for papers, to go someplace. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Because we didn't want to remain in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1536">The memories were horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1537">The <span class="dlf">streets</span> were bloody. </sentence><sentence id="1538">There was no need to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1539">So, we arranged it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
