<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Helen, what was it like growing up as a Jewish child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: I couldn't tell you, because I thought everybody was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="76">In some way I was not aware that the children I was playing on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> with were neighbors that they were not Jewish, because all the children I knew were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="77"><span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> is a big <span class="populated place">city</span> and, uh, was a big <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time too. </sentence><sentence id="78">It...1 was...I was thinking I was living in a <span class="region">Jewish world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">We were not that very religious. </sentence><sentence id="80">We were liberals, as it was called in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">And my parents went to the high holidays to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">We didn't live far from <span class="building">synagogue</span> and, uh, there was no <span class="building">Sunday school</span> because most of the things we had in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">We had very little Hebrew lessons, but we did uh have the Rabbi teaching us the history of the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="120">laughs) And he came also from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we got married after Hitler took power, which was in January 30th, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="122">He had lost already his job and we...but I still had my income, and we got married with the intention to leave the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were married by the way by the Orthodox Rabbi who married my parents and his parents. </sentence><sentence id="124">And, um, we left <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1934 going to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="125"> " <span class="populated place">Norderney</span>, one of the <span class="region">German Frisian islands</span> in the <span class="env feature">North Sea</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="126">* Siegfried Wohlfarth. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: What happened next? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Now, the trip to <span class="country">Holland</span>...the preparations of leaving <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time so very early was a little different than it became later. </sentence><sentence id="129">We could took take everything with us. </sentence><sentence id="130">And he had a job there. </sentence><sentence id="131">He was a CPA. </sentence><sentence id="132">He had gotten a job there. </sentence><sentence id="133">I couldn't work there -

without the coupons you couldn't live. </sentence><sentence id="473">Our friends from this <span class="building">church</span> came every second Saturday and brought us coupons. </sentence><sentence id="474">The coupons were stolen every month in the <span class="building">distribution centers</span> by another person. </sentence><sentence id="475">All around <span class="country">Holland</span> for the 20,000 people in <span class="country">Holland</span> who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="476">When the war was over, it was only 10,000. </sentence><sentence id="477">The others were found. </sentence><sentence id="478">And uh they brought us everything we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="479">Any book and we just had to write it down and they tried to get us the books and they brought it. </sentence><sentence id="480">And they told us also what, how the war was going because we were cut off from the world because they were listening to the BBC. </sentence><sentence id="481">If you are caught to listen to the <span class="building">BBC</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span>, you were executed. </sentence><sentence id="482">deg Ab Reusink. </sentence><sentence id="483">7 Two years and several months later, when a special department of the occupational forces arrived, Ab Reusink protested that Helen and Seigfried's <span class="spatial

Germans paid Reusink the amount of the contract, which he then turned over to Helen and Seigfried. </sentence><sentence id="486"> They did it, and they told us what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="487">What was going on and how well we were doing, we heard it from them. </sentence><sentence id="488">They also told us in July of 1944, that there were six <span

one. </sentence><sentence id="491">It was <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">And by that time two million Jews already had been gassed. </sentence><sentence id="493">They were telling that and, uh, it was very upsetting naturally. </sentence><sentence id="494">And everybody was hopeful, very, very hopeful that the end was coming. </sentence><sentence id="495">So on this day when we were arrested, we were brought to the <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">Oh, I have to say when those men came- there were four men- two Germans and two Dutch, and two of them were <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> at the front and <span class="dlf">back door</span>, and two of them came up to our <span class="interior

id="498">They looked at the little belongings we had. </sentence><sentence id="499">They saw a picture of our daughter on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, because our friends brought us always picture to show what she was looking because she had gone to...going to <span class="building">school</span> and then she was very happy where she was. </sentence><sentence id="500">And she looked happy. </sentence><sentence id="501">Uh, the one man said, "If this is your child, and if you have more children in hiding, we recommend that you take them with you because you are going into a <span

id="503">And you will be...they will be taken care of while you are working. </sentence><sentence id="504">And my husband and I, we didn't even have to look at each other, we didn't answer that. </sentence><sentence id="505">Then, they announ...the other man said, "Why don't you take some warm clothes with you. </sentence><sentence id="506">Where you are going it is very cold." </sentence><sentence id="507">That was true. </sentence><sentence id="508">But we decided that we would take nothing. </sentence><sentence id="509">We went completely without <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>, knowing that we probably would come to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> because this was in some way called a punishment that we did not follow the first time...that we had to be punished for that, so it could only have been <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">And, uh, the, uh, the, uh...one, one and half day interrogation by the Gestapo was mostly about giving the names of the people who brought us those cards, because they had no idea who was breaking in and getting those tickets, and it must have been a

children with you." </sentence><sentence id="851">And she did. </sentence><sentence id="852">So I thought maybe I did something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="853">Maybe I did not really believe that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you. </sentence><sentence id="854">So they took us...was a three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the <span class="spatial object">car</span> stopped and the soldiers came in and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the money wasn't worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="855">Where we were going we should give our money, and my husband decided...we had our money in <span class="spatial object">belt</span>, <span class="spatial object">money belt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="856">We had that on, it on all those years. </sentence><sentence id="857">And he didn't give anything. </sentence><sentence id="858">So when they closed again, we started to rip up this money...thousands of guilders. </sentence><sentence id="859">Wasn't easy to do. </sentence><sentence id="860">It's a physical step, also to rip it in little pieces. </sentence><sentence id="861">But we did. </sentence><sentence id="862">I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it. </sentence><sentence id="863">And, uh, we arrived in the middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the <span class="dlf">doors</span> opened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from <span class="populated place">Kanada</span> which we did not know <span class="populated place">Kanada</span> existed. </sentence><sentence id="864">They looked very clean, starched uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="865">They'd never answer any questions. </sentence><sentence id="866">We said, "Where are we?" </sentence><sentence id="867">No questions. </sentence><sentence id="868">Just getting the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> out. </sentence><sentence id="869">And all the people had brought with them, half <span class="building">households</span>. </sentence><sentence id="870">It was all gone and  1 people, I'm sure it was at every <span class="spatial object">train</span> the same were very upset, and they always got promised, "We bring it to you where you are. </sentence><sentence id="871">We know where you will be." </sentence><sentence id="872">And, uh, at least we didn't have to go through that. </sentence><sentence id="873">The woman and the child and I were together when we started to move in <span class="spatial object">rows</span> after we were separated from the men. </sentence><sentence id="874">And we walked...the <span class="dlf">ramp</span> was endless. </sentence><sentence id="875">I don't know how long, how many <span class="spatial object">cars</span> there were, but it seemed endless and there was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we did not know that. </sentence><sentence id="876">He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I said no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one side to go for me and to the other side for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they were taking care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="877">And, uh, this man was very good looking. </sentence><sentence id="878">I have never forgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="879">There were more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, <span class="spatial object">train</span> after <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">But this was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots. </sentence><sentence id="881">He was just a perfect specimen of a man. </sentence><sentence id="882">And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few months..few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, "Would you recognize him?" </sentence><sentence id="883">I said, "No, I'm sure not." </sentence><sentence id="884">The way he looked then at his height and, how can you? </sentence><sentence id="885">So he to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I heard the next day also. </sentence><sentence id="886">And, uh, there were no Jewish children in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, just a few Dr.Mengele wanted. </sentence><sentence id="887">Otherwise, there were no Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="888">And the mothers were killed with them when they had the mother. </sentence><sentence id="889">Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I met a woman who was with us in the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="890">A young woman. </sentence><sentence id="891">A very beautiful looking woman. </sentence><sentence id="892">She was very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="893">And after..I had very . </sentence><sentence id="894">.I had hardly any contact with her. </sentence><sentence id="895">All of a sudden she said to me, "You know what I did? </sentence><sentence id="896">I knew they would kill the children, and I let my children go," and uh she said, "I couldn't help him them because I would be killed too." </sentence><sentence id="897">She knew all that. </sentence><sentence id="898">She said, "I heard it maybe two days before I was on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and I let my children go." </sentence><sentence id="899">I don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="900">I don't know how she lived through it. </sentence><sentence id="901">I wish she would be living and that she could have children again. </sentence><sentence id="902">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="903">But that...went with me for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="904">How do you live with that? </sentence><sentence id="905">The, uh, the side where we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this good side, and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very large <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="906">And I must say when we were walking to this place in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> I heard voices. </sentence><sentence id="907">I heard women speak. </sentence><sentence id="908">I heard dogs and I heard music. </sentence><sentence id="909">And I said to the other women I said, "I thought we would come to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> where they kill everybody. </sentence><sentence id="910">This is life. </sentence><sentence id="911">We are coming into life. </sentence><sentence id="912">You hear the noises? </sentence><sentence id="913">You don't have to worry." </sentence><sentence id="914">So, uh, we were called into that <span class="interior space">room</span> and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long <span class="spatial object">table</span> on a <span class="dlf">wall</span> and they all were wearing black satin dresses. </sentence><sentence id="915">Not the same dress, but the same material, and their hair was beautiful, long. </sentence><sentence id="916">Young women, very, very attractive women. </sentence><sentence id="917">And they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we were with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our clothes, strip. </sentence><sentence id="918">The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my wedding band off my finger. </sentence><sentence id="919">I had forgotten I had it. </sentence><sentence id="920">Maybe I would have tried to put it in my mouth or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="921">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="922">So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="923">I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="924">So they helped us and they found out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other places and, uh, they shaved us,  2 our head hair and our body hair. </sentence><sentence id="925">They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had come. </sentence><sentence id="926">I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us. </sentence><sentence id="927">And I knew the Franks. </sentence><sentence id="928">And I did not know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="929">So I heard her discussing with one of those women...the woman..and she was with one daughter...no...she was with two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="930">There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she should give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, "I bring you every day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine." </sentence><sentence id="931">And she was very naive and she did this. </sentence><sentence id="932">She never got a drop of soup. </sentence><sentence id="933">The woman who was handling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know anymore. </sentence><sentence id="934">She said, "You have good shoes on." </sentence><sentence id="935">I said, "Yes, I am very glad I have good shoes on." </sentence><sentence id="936">She said, "Would you like to change with me?" </sentence><sentence id="937">I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="938">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="939">And then we came under the cold <span class="interior space">shower</span> and then we were outside the <span class="building">house</span> and we got a dress, uh a . </sentence><sentence id="940">.dress. </sentence><sentence id="941">It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool. </sentence><sentence id="942">It could have been a size 10 or it could have been a size 25. </sentence><sentence id="943">It made no difference. </sentence><sentence id="944">I got a dress and we went to the <span class="building">barrack</span> for the night. </sentence><sentence id="945">That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night..all that took the to the other night. </sentence><sentence id="946">We still didn't get to eat. </sentence><sentence id="947">We still couldn't go to the <span class="interior space">latrine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="948">In the meantime it was a <span class="building">latrine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="949">And we were, uh brought to the <span class="building">barrack</span> and we were exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="950">Absolutely exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="951">And I had a dream which was with me for many years and, uh, I dreamt that I was coming <span class="building">home</span> and I was telling my family and my friends the strange things that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore. </sentence><sentence id="952">Probably the most upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing everything you had, just as you are born. </sentence><sentence id="953">I think that was the greatest shock. </sentence><sentence id="954">You couldn't see yourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like. </sentence><sentence id="955">I think it was the greatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore. </sentence><sentence id="956">That was over. </sentence><sentence id="957">And our young girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh <span class="building">orphanage</span> of Jewish girls from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, girls of 15 years old, and they came from <span class="country">Morocco</span>, and they were brought to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and they were all taken, and we had them all. </sentence><sentence id="958">Beautiful girls. </sentence><sentence id="959">Fifteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="960">All they could speak was their own language. </sentence><sentence id="961">They had nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="962">They couldn't talk to anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="963">They were very upset when they were not menstruating. </sentence><sentence id="964">Everybody very young was uh concerned, but then it was a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="965">What would we have done? </sentence><sentence id="966">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="967">We had no underwear. </sentence><sentence id="968">We had nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1135">Q: You're in the <span class="building">barrack</span> . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1137">A: Yes, I am in the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We had 10 or 12 people in a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, and it was in the middle of the night when we came, so it was very short time that we could sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1139">When the morning came and the first day in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> started, was a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Roll call in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I'm sure that everybody had about the same experience...that's uh the <span class="building">barrack</span> elder was counting everybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to stand exactly in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I wanted to be little and short and not being seen. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Later on, I found that the women who were tall were always picked to special things. </sentence><sentence id="1145">They were not always good. </sentence><sentence id="1146">So I didn't want to be picked for anything. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I didn't want to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So, uh, we were counted but every roll call, every roll call was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1149">It never came out that we were as many people as they had had on their books. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And the women got very...those women, those <span class="building">barrack</span> elder, were very upset about it. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Uh, I still didn't know that they were <span class="building">prison</span>, Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It didn't dawn on me that they would be prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Look at us and look at them. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="1156">So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the <span class="building">barrack</span> and they found people who were hiding under the <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> and they were found people who had died, and though they put them all there on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and counted them, and I think then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Even they mostly spoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1159">When this roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> to get the coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And it was in big <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy, I always volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I guess I was curious to see what the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> looked like. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I think that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1164">You didn't see much because you never had...got into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and most of the people who worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> were born in <span class="country">Poland</span> and spoke Polish and, uh, for long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between the Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> also. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Maybe even stronger, that  4 didn't dawn on me first either. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Eh . .. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish women who had been there or some other <span class="populated place">camp</span> and <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> for a long time already. </sentence><sentence id="1168">This was "44. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They started in <span class="populated place">39</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1170">So, uh, they had so called jobs, and when somebody came, new in, who had been hiding or so, they always had a job for them. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Always. </sentence><sentence id="1172">They got...we never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They got help. </sentence><sentence id="1174">We didn't...I didn't...I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I came with a Dutch group, and I was considered to be Dutch because I spoke Dutch with them. </sentence><sentence id="1176">The Dutch women were uh very unfortunate because they could never adjust, practically. </sentence><sentence id="1177">They, uh, died like the flies, especially in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And, uh, I didn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I met the Hungarian women who had come a few months before us. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Very intelligent, very...also attractive women. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They were at that...in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> | was...it was uh, <span class="building">Birkenau B-2</span>, uh, they were the keepers of the <span class="building">latrines</span>, and the <span class="interior space">washrooms</span>, and I uh washing...I don't know for some reason I thought I just have to wash every day and they were not always open, but I got friendly with them and I could come in. </sentence><sentence id="1182">Now washing is a big work because we had high, uh, uh, wash stands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water. </sentence><sentence id="1183">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And then you put your dress on again. </sentence><sentence id="1185">But it gave me a very good feeling that I had done that. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I felt...I felt I needed that. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And, uh, the Dutch women said to me, "You are crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The next thing is you get pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1189">How can you go under that cold <span class="env feature">water</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1190">You get pneumonia." </sentence><sentence id="1191">I said, "Maybe there is some loose dirt because it's already you know some...a whole day, but whatever there is, I feel good." </sentence><sentence id="1192">They didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1193">It was not very comfortable climbing, but also the friendship I had with the...with the women from <span class="country">Hungary</span> helped me to get in and have some time to talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="1194">The same with uh the <span class="building">latrine</span> was closed at many hours. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I could always get in. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And, uh, we...we became good friends. </sentence><sentence id="1197">They were much younger
