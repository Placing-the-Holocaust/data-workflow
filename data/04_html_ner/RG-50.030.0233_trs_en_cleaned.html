because they felt that she might be more secure there than in <span class="populated place">Bro.</span> </sentence><sentence id="139">And that's how I met her. </sentence><sentence id="140">She lives now in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, <span class="populated place">D.C.</span> Survived the war, of course. </sentence><sentence id="141">I believe she was sent to <span class="country">Sweden</span> during the war. </sentence><sentence id="142">Now, when I lost the job at [Fischer's (ph)], I approached a gentile man whose name was [an k Stan k (ph)], who was in the <span class="building">ready-to-wear business</span>, manufacturing in <span class="populated place">Boskovice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">And he said, "Why not? </sentence><sentence id="144">I had a Jewish fellow before you. </sentence><sentence id="145">His name is Benno [Langer (ph)]." </sentence><sentence id="146">I knew him. </sentence><sentence id="147">He went to <span class="country">Palestine</span> illegally at that time. </sentence><sentence id="148">"And if you want to come in the morning, you can start next week. </sentence><sentence id="149">I am expecting a contract from the government for, I believe, 3,000 uh...coats for the army. </sentence><sentence id="150">And a similar amount of jackets and pants, I think." </sentence><sentence id="151">And he told me, "I hate to tell you that, but you will have to come a little bit early in the morning and start the fire in the <span class="spatial object">oven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">And you will have to...you will have to...uh...sweep the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, whatever there will have be done  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*233 6 manually." </sentence><sentence id="153">I says, "That's fine, Mr. [Stan_k (ph)]."_ </sentence><sentence id="154">As it turned out, he was there before me; and he made the fire and he swept the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">And around 8:30, 9:00, I went to the <span class="building">post office</span>--he had a <span class="building">post office</span> box--and got the mail. </sentence><sentence id="156">I said to him, "Mr. [Stan_k (ph)], if you don't mind, we have a lot of labor here which have no work." </sentence><sentence id="157">Because there was a shortage of textiles to manufacture. </sentence><sentence id="158">And he says, "What do you propose to do?" </sentence><sentence id="159">And I says, "I would write a letter to the <span class="building">Chamber of Commerce</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>." </sentence><sentence id="160">And I think I picked another <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">I think <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">I don't know why. " </sentence><sentence id="163">And tell them that we have the labor force, the qualified labor force." </sentence><sentence id="164">These were all <span class="building">home shops</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">These were little <span class="building">shops</span> in <span class="building">homes</span> in the surrounding <span class="populated place">villages</span>, where the <span class="env feature">farmland</span> wasn't good enough to support the people. </sentence><sentence id="166">So they all were <span class="building">tailors</span>, with very few exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="167">And there was the head of that <span class="building">household</span>, his wife; even the children were sewing and the grandparents were sewing. </sentence><sentence id="168">And they were specializing in different items. </sentence><sentence id="169">There was a family who made only slacks. </sentence><sentence id="170">Another one who made vests. </sentence><sentence id="171">Others made jackets. </sentence><sentence id="172">And others made top coats or rain coats. </sentence><sentence id="173">So he says, "Go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="174">And I wrote that letter; and we got in a very few days, responses from four people. </sentence><sentence id="175">From four <span class="building">businesses</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, and the one I think was from <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And we had to...we made up a few samples for them. </sentence><sentence id="177">And he became in time the largest <span class="building">manufacturer</span> in (laughing) <span class="populated place">Boskovice</span> for these people. </sentence><sentence id="178">Now one of them...one of these <span class="building">businesses</span> from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, the name was [<span class="building">Haudigen Grabel</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="179">These people I met with. </sentence><sentence id="180">They came to...to us, to see. </sentence><sentence id="181">And then there was another one, and I forgot the name. </sentence><sentence id="182">But the merchandise, which was precut with all the bindings, was come...was coming in big...uh...<span class="spatial object">woven containers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">And there were old labels, old metal labels, which read "Sinai and Cohen." </sentence><sentence id="184">So these German people, these Austrian people in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, must have taken over some business from some Jewish people in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and forgot to take off the...the vignettes. </sentence><sentence id="185">Well, anyhow, I became...uh...the head man. </sentence><sentence id="186">Originally, of course, there was only he and myself; and then he took in his nephew. </sentence><sentence id="187">A young fellow. </sentence><sentence id="188">His name is  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*233 5 Ladislav Konechni (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="189">Very nice fellow. </sentence><sentence id="190">And we were really very busy. </sentence><sentence id="191">And I did the best I could for our labor, too, because I paid the highest rates. </sentence><sentence id="192">There were different classes of...grades of.... For instance, for a pair of <span class="spatial object">pants</span> you could pay from, say, 10 crowns a piece to maybe 18 crowns--depending on the grade. </sentence><sentence id="193">I put everything in the highest grade; because I figured, "Let the Germans pay. </sentence><sentence id="194">And that local people, they need the money here." </sentence><sentence id="195">And these people appreciated...appreciated me very much. </sentence><sentence id="196">And many of them knew me from the place where I worked before. </sentence><sentence id="197">And they were bringing us now from their little farms butter, chicken, and even fish from the <span class="env feature">pond</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">In one little <span class="populated place">village</span>, there was a <span class="env feature">pond</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I...we had so much food, I didn't know if I can bring this to the place where I worked; but I told them where to deposit it with my parents...that we helped other people. </sentence><sentence id="200">Because at that time, the restrictions were already very strict. </sentence><sentence id="201">The Jewish people...first of all, you had cards. </sentence><sentence id="202">You had ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="203">But the Jewish people were allowed to <span class="building">shop</span> only from 3 to 4 in the afternoon, when everything was gone anyways. </sentence><sentence id="204">Yet we had more chicken, fowl and butter and eggs in the <span class="building">house</span> than ever before. </sentence><sentence id="205">Which my mother paid for it as soon as we got it. </sentence><sentence id="206">And this man paid me really a very decent salary. </sentence><sentence id="207">I..I made a lot of money with him--uh, relatively, you know. </sentence><sentence id="208">With what I started, I would say I did at least five times as much than when I started to work for him. </sentence><sentence id="209">And he appreciated me very much, too. </sentence><sentence id="210">Now, these people from <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span>, for those we made raincoats. </sentence><sentence id="211">And when we made up the first sample, they wanted to know how much yardage we need per <span class="spatial object">raincoat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">I mean, for a set of all sizes. </sentence><sentence id="213">And we wrote them whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="214">I think the merchandise were...was a little bit wider, whatever; it happened from each...so many raincoats, we had one for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="215">And this Mr. [Stan _k (ph)], he collected the yard goods and took it <span class="building">home</span>, in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">I have never seen that;
