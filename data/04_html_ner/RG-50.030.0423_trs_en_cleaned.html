<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: I am Robert Treuer, I was born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, January 31st, 1926. </sentence><sentence id="4">My family, my parents and I, I was the only child were considered Jewish even though we did not practice the religion, and know I had my grandparents and I am told, my great-grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="5">However, in the European system, such as it was, we were considered Jews, and when I started first grade, and <span class="building">school</span> began with the saying of the Lord's prayer, the teacher rapped an interruption and pointed to me and said you can't say that, you have to be quiet while the rest of the children say the Lord's prayer, and we'll start over again, and they did. </sentence><sentence id="6">I vividly remember March of 1938, when the Nazi's came in. </sentence><sentence id="7">I remember the tension during the days beforehand. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was awakened about two in the morning by SA troops marching in front of our <span class="building">house</span>, singing the song, marching

underground newspapers from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and he and an associate distributed these newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="9">What happened was that he had been very active in the social democratic party, particularly in youth and children's activities and cultural activities until the fascist takeover in 1934 and the fighting that then erupted. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was involved, he had tried to distribute guns from the <span class="interior space">back stoop</span> of his <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">I saw the fighting, I saw the , the national  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that my father took long summer vacations, during which he established a new identity as an itinerant farm laborer on <span class="dlf">farms</span> along the <span class="dlf">Austrian-Czechoslovak border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">The growth of the Austrian Nazi party was palpable, although again as a child I did not, that did not register with me particularly. </sentence><sentence id="13">When the Nazis, or when Anschluss came, in March of 1938, and the German army marched in unopposed, either by <span class="country">Austria</span> or any other international community, and apparently with the tacit backing of Mussolini in <span class="country">Italy</span>, the reception that I saw of the German troops, you know the Nazis, by the Austrian population was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="14">And for example, many of the active socialists, even those in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, switched parties and joined the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="15">Some of them warned my father that because they knew, now the Nazis would know about his underground activities and that he and his associate, Ernst Pollit(ph) would be very wise to cut it out immediately. </sentence><sentence id="16">My father, Fritz Treuer, was under no illusions what the advent of the Nazis meant, he knew about the Nuremberg laws, about the persecution of the Jews, about confiscation of property, and he immediately started making efforts to get us out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">Some of the rest of our relatives were not as alarmed as he was, my mother's two sisters and their husbands, professional people, thought that well, they were engineers, they had particular skills that were in demand and they didn't, while things might be unpleasant, there was no great danger. </sentence><sentence id="18">My father tried to tell them otherwise and was not believed. </sentence><sentence id="19">He also tried to get three or four Jewish boys together and give us the beginnings of rudimentary military training in somebody's <span class="dlf">garden</span> behind a <span class="building">house</span>, a high <span class="env feature">hedge</span> or a <span class="dlf">wall</span> around it, it lasted exactly two times, two afternoons after <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">Somebody saw us, it was reported and one the erstwhile socialists got ahold of Dad and said this had better stop right now or you're going to get nailed. </sentence><sentence id="21">That was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="22">My accordion teacher, who came to our <span class="building">house</span> in a <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span>, was stopped in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">He was a very large man, his name was Hamlish, and very curly black hair, he was immediately taken for a Jew by passing by Nazis, who began This

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection pulling his hair, beating him up and so on, although I think he would have been big enough to take care of any two or three of them. </sentence><sentence id="26">It was impossible, they were armed. </sentence><sentence id="27">That was the last accordion lesson. </sentence><sentence id="28">Hamlish incidentally, and his wife managed to escape, I'm not sure exactly how they came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, they subsequently had children born in this <span class="country">country</span>, one of whom is Marvin Hamlish, a musical arranger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: I wanted to ask, before the Anschluss, and you mentioned specifically that when you were in <span class="building">school</span> and you were sitting in, you were in the <span class="interior space">classroom</span> singing and they stopped, the teacher asked you to stop, was that the only incident that was before March 1938? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: No, the only incident of anti-Semitism that I experienced? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: No, there were many, that was just a representative? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: That was a representative, there were many, and on the <span class="dlf">street</span> there was the usual bullying. </sentence><sentence id="65">My parents took the attitude that whether it was racial or not, I had to fight my own fights, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="66">The anti-Semitism was generic and general and you picked up on it in many subtle ways. </sentence><sentence id="67">It was not usually violent, except as when kids fought on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, although I do remember one incident which may give you the flavor of it, is before the Anschluss, some of us kids were playing in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I was, chasing each other, reckless, I didn't look, plunging across the <span class="dlf">street</span> head first and ran into a bicyclist hard enough, I bent the front wheel of his <span class="spatial object">bike</span> badly enough so he couldn't ride it. </sentence><sentence id="68">I got some good cuts and bruises out of that one, but he immediately found out who I was, knew who my father was and he was a local Nazi, remember this was before the Anschluss, and he marched me and his damaged <span class="spatial object">bike</span> to Dad's <span class="building">store</span> and swung enough weight by virtue of his party membership so that before Dad could even attend to me and take me to the <span class="interior space">emergency room</span>, which was done later, he had to pay the man off for the damage to the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, cash then and there or else, and the or else could and probably would have been beatings, damage to the <span class="building">store</span>, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="69">After This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="70">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="71"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the Anschluss, and very quickly saw, there was such an explosion of uniforms, Hitler youth and so on, amazingly fast. </sentence><sentence id="72">There were round-ups of Jews in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, made to scrub the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">This happened to a distant relative of ours, and elderly woman, not in good health and when some of the people standing around made remarks about that to the storm troopers who were conducting the <span class="dlf">street</span> scrubbing, one of them walked over to the woman and said, well I think maybe you can get up and leave, it seems you're not Jewish, and she said, yes I am, I'm 400% Jewish, all four of my grandparents are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">A similar thing happened to my mother who was rounded up between piano lessons, on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, and she was blonde, blue-eyed, petite. </sentence><sentence id="75">If you wanted a poster girl for your Aryan woman, she would have been it, and again when she was down there scrubbing <span class="dlf">streets</span>, people started to mutter that these stupid SS men, SA men didn't know what they were doing, look at this, and one of them told mom to get up and get out of there and she said, no I'm Jewish, I belong here the same as the rest of these people, I'll go when they go. </sentence><sentence id="76">And I think that was a very short-lived, <span class="dlf">street</span> scrubbing. </sentence><sentence id="77">It wasn't always that kind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: So immediately after Anschluss, you immediately felt an impact on your personal lives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: It was immediate and it was massive. </sentence><sentence id="96">In the popular support, and you heard nothing against it, no one spoke against it, and my parents got busy, my father particularly. </sentence><sentence id="97">Remember him telling my mother that it was only a matter of days before the Nuremberg laws were applied, as indeed they were, and that they had to do everything possible to get out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">Now I later came across, in my parents personal papers, and then they're both dead now, correspondence to <span class="country">Bolivia</span>, <span class="country">Mexico</span>, <span class="country">Chili</span>, anywhere possible to get out. </sentence><sentence id="99">What eventually happened was that my mother found employment as a housemaid in a <span class="building">rural English household</span>, I think through an <span class="building">employment agency</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="100">Through a <span class="building">refugee agency</span>, a place was found for me in an <span class="building">English

only if you had proof of employment, if you were a child, you had to have proof that somebody would take you in, well my mother's employers would not allow a child, however the place in the <span

<span class="interior space">floor</span>, <span class="spatial object">Nazi banners</span> are flying there and I panicked, I was terrified, I didn't know what had happened, were we back in <span

had found another <span class="building">school</span> that would take me in free, there was no money. </sentence><sentence id="122">What little our family had had been sequestered and we had no

the large <span class="building">dormitory</span> with many other boys my age, one started screaming in great pain, and I tried to find out from the boy in the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> next to mine what was going on and I didn't understand the English, and he pointed at his appendix and I knew what that was, the boy had appendicitis and he screamed for a long time before finally some of the staff showed up and the gist of what they had told him was to turn over and pray. </sentence><sentence id="125">Well I understood that clearly enough, I found myself in a place where if you had appendicitis, you prayed. </sentence><sentence id="126">The next day the other kids went to various <span class="building">classes</span>, I had no English, they told me to hang around in the

him, and I leaped off the <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span>, ran in front of it, there was one coming the other way and the motorman was clanging with his footbell because the two were just about head to head and I had ducked in front of that one and ran. </sentence><sentence id="137">I remember correctly, I ran across the <span class="dlf">street</span>, over a <span

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Yes, I wanted at first to talk about your father, you mentioned before Anschluss, before he was involved with the Socialists, but at the time you didn't know that, that was something you learned afterwards? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: It was something I learned afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: But did you remember anything about him going to meetings or friends that he was . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: He did, now during that __ between the time the fascists took over in 1934 and the Anschluss in 1938, he did take me with him to visit friends sometimes and I remember one time he was visiting a friend and, who played a Victrola or phonograph for him of some Schubert __, and they were saying oh, we better keep the volume down, this one is forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="145">It was a Schubert song, I forget now, , Your Thoughts are Free, well that was forbidden, and one of the things  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 paper, was that he did a lot of typing, mimeographing for a man by the name of Leon Schalit, who was the official translator of Galsworthy's works into German, and what Dad and his associate did was slipsheet the underground newspapers into the book manuscript to be returned to Schalit, and Ernst Pollit(ph) who helped my Dad, had to make almost daily trips back and forth between Dad's <span class="building">shop</span> and Schalit's <span class="building">home</span>, and this was a means of getting the newspapers out. </sentence><sentence id="146">Ironically, a high <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> police official lived in the same <span class="building">building</span> that housed my dad's <span class="building">store</span> and had two armed guards standing in front of the <span class="building">building</span> all the time and they would check Pollit(ph) periodically and find out what he was carrying, but the <span class="spatial object">packages</span> were so big and heavy and clumsy that they didn't want to bother with him and they saw him every day, so they were never caught for that. </sentence><sentence id="147">During the first days of the fascist takeover in "34, the underground newspaper was printed on the presses of the largest newspaper in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">After that paper had finished it's first run, the <span class="spatial object">printer</span> stayed behind and ran off the <span class="spatial object">underground newspaper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">They got away with that for months until some bookkeeper upstairs in the <span class="building">office</span> found out that the electricity bills were higher than they used to be and they got caught. </sentence><sentence id="150">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="151">Well one thing leads to another, I remember my father meeting with some streetcar motorman and the discussion was how to distribute underground newspapers at a big football game, and they came up with this system that the <span class="dlf">streetcar line</span> ended next to the <span class="building">football stadium</span> and that the motorman had a few minutes between runs and they used, they would ball up the newspapers and fire them over the <span class="dlf">outside walls</span> of the <span class="building">stadium</span> with slingshots, and they fell amongst the audience. </sentence><sentence id="152">Not a very efficient system, but what can you do? </sentence><sentence id="153">You wanted to ask some? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Oh sure, again about your father, you mentioned it was, this was after March 1938, or was it, maybe I didn't understand, but he during the summertime went and he created another identity, you said, as a? </sentence></p></dialogue>

believe continued that after he had shipped Mom and me out of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">He closed the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">All the goods and contents had been taken anyhow by the concierge's daughter and son-in-law, he was SS, they took the whole <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and Dad just disappeared and I believe he lapsed into that identity, but in mean, had to come back again frequently to process his papers for his <span class="dlf">exit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">Now, his recollections tome __ <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> visits, were that he had to stand in a long <span class="dlf">line</span> at a <span class="building">hotel</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, downtown <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, I believe he said it was the <span class="building">Imperial</span> if 1 remember correctly, had been taken over by SS, to process exit visas and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="176">He said as he got there early in the morning, two <span class="dlf">lines</span> had formed, he stood in the one he believed he had to go through, and the other <span class="dlf">line</span> were elderly couples and it turned out that these people were undergoing compulsory divorce if one was Aryan and the other one Jewish, they were compelled to be divorced and he described to me not only the utter silence in which both <span class="dlf">lines</span> inched forward, but the weeping, the old people as they came back down, not knowing where to go, what to do, with whom they could be. </sentence><sentence id="177">It was pitiful, absolutely pitiful. </sentence><sentence id="178">During that time also, while my father was back and forth between <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and his farm laborer identity, he had to pass a medical examination, which revealed him to have a hernia.

signed, you'll let us go ahead, otherwise I can sew you up right now, and Dad said go ahead, and he eventually fainted. </sentence><sentence id="181">He moved from <span class="interior

how to get out and suddenly they were preoccupied with finding a World War 1 bayonet in somebody's <span class="interior space">dresser drawer</span> and the man to whom it belonged was anxiously explaining what this was and so on, they were all clustered around him, so Dad marched out of the <span class="interior space">room</span>, snapped a Heil(ph) Hitler salute and they didn't turn around, they said Heil(ph) Hitler, he walked past them or out. </sentence><sentence id="183">We'll never know whether they were looking for him or anybody in particular but he got out. </sentence><sentence id="184">Got out, came to <span class="country">England</span> and he and Mom wound up working in the same <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence
