<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Naive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Maybe naive, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="54">Because, as I say, it was hard to believe so; it was easy enough to believe it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: So when did the Germans come into <span class="populated place">Prague</span> -- what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: To me personally, not too much. </sentence><sentence id="60">The only thing, I was working for the lawyer and we had German clients. </sentence><sentence id="61">But they behaved towards me okay. </sentence><sentence id="62">They needed me more or less. </sentence><sentence id="63">I was working for them. </sentence><sentence id="64">I was typing their things because the other girls in the <span class="building">office</span> didn't know how to type German, so I didn't feel too much personally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Did the clients know that you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="74">The ones we were working with did know it and the new ones, when Germans came, we didn't say it. </sentence><sentence id="75">They probably suspected it, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="77">But what I would like to learn more about is -- the Germans occupied <span class="populated place">Prague</span> in March of 1939, right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: They were marching through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">Look today. </sentence><sentence id="88">Let's put it this way, it was simpler. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Maybe people were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="95">But I wasn't -- personally, I wasn't too much afraid. </sentence><sentence id="96">I know I speak German and what can they do to me. </sentence><sentence id="97">If they need something from me they will come, but I think, what can they do to me? </sentence><sentence id="98">I was naive, but it was easier to think this way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Were they hurting people? </sentence><sentence id="105">Were they beating people? </sentence><sentence id="106">Were they shooting -- anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: They might have, but I didn't know it and even if there was something going on close, I probably looked away. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was simple. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: But you knew they were taking people away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="130">We knew it, but what could we do? </sentence><sentence id="131">Not too much. </sentence><sentence id="132">If anything, maybe look away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Who were they taking away? </sentence><sentence id="138">Was it a particular group of people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: I don't know whether it was a particular group. </sentence><sentence id="142">Someone was in their way or someone wanted his work, or so, they found an excuse to take him away. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Do you remember what some of the rules were? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: What about -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: I couldn't continue my studies at the <span class="building">university</span>, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: What about continuing to <span class="building">temple</span>, that sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yeah, we could, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="194">It wasn't so open. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: So they didn't close anything down. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: One more question about when they were starting to send the people away. </sentence><sentence id="209">Did you know where they were going, or what was the rumor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: The rumor was that it's a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, but we wouldn't want to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="213">I mean, it was unpleasant to believe it, so we just took it -- "what can we do?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: Now, did they ever establish in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> sort of a group of Jewish leaders who would help maintain order or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: They did, but I didn't know them. </sentence><sentence id="216">As I say, I was working for a lawyer who was married to a Jewish woman, but it didn't concern him that he is employing me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So what you're telling me is that for you personally, life didn't change too terribly much? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: It was in'49. </sentence><sentence id="242">It was pretty early after they came about, I would say about eight months after they came in. </sentence><sentence id="243">But they sent me to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> and I didn't believe that's terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="248">Let me just backtrack a little. </sentence><sentence id="249">Now I have a note -- I don't know if this is correct -- that you went to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> in December of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="250">Does that sound about right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: What did it look like though? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Well when I came off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> there was nothing there, and when I came there, there were those places, or how you would call it, and they said "you go into this category, and you go into that one", and I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="364">They told me you are assigned to this <span class="interior space">room</span> and it happened to be a small <span class="building">house</span>, and in my <span class="interior space">room</span>, we were seven people. </sentence><sentence id="365">Sleeping on three or four <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> from next to the other. </sentence><sentence id="366">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="367">I didn't think too much. </sentence><sentence id="368">I just took things as they came. </sentence><sentence id="369">It's silly from today's point of view. </sentence><sentence id="370">But I did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: I'm just trying to get as much detail as possible. </sentence><sentence id="380">So you were sent to this <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">Were you registered first? </sentence><sentence id="382">Was there some process, or were you just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: We were registered before we went onto the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">You know, so they had all our data already. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: And you were allowed to keep your regular clothes and wear them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
