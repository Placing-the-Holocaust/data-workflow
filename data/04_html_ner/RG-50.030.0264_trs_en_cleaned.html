that was my birthday present and I ate those for breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="380">And we went to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">Of course, we took our life into our hands because we...the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were spot checked. </sentence><sentence id="382">I did not take my identification card with us and neither did my...I left with my mother and my younger sister who was...at that time she was 16. </sentence><sentence id="383">I had borrowed from a girlfriend of mine an identification card without a J on it. </sentence><sentence id="384">She had given it to me. </sentence><sentence id="385">We didn't look at all alike. </sentence><sentence id="386">Her picture was...she was blond, and I had black hair. </sentence><sentence id="387">But she gave it to me. </sentence><sentence id="388">She wanted me to have it. </sentence><sentence id="389">Fortunately, we were never checked on that <span

id="391">We did leave...that time we left in the day time. </sentence><sentence id="392">And at night there were about something like 17 who who made it. </sentence><sentence id="393">Three of them were caught. </sentence><sentence id="394">We don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="395">I had I should have taken that card that my girlfriend had given me and torn it up and she should have claimed that she had lost it. </sentence><sentence id="396">One of the young men on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>...in the <span class="building">farm house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="397">was going to <span class="populated place">The Hague</span> the next day, and I told him, "Would you take this card and give it to my girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="398">Give it back to her." </sentence><sentence id="399">He said, "Sure." </sentence><sentence id="400">As it happened, that <span class="spatial object">train</span> was being checked, and he became flustered and they took him off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and searched him and found that card. </sentence><sentence id="401">The first thing that they did they went to my girlfriend's <span class="building">house</span> and they put her in <span class="building">jail</span> and he sort of confessed that he had gotten the card from me. </sentence><sentence id="402">He was very, very nervous. </sentence><sentence id="403">And they put her in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="404">And she was kept there for a whole week, and the only reason why she was let out was she kept insisting that I had stolen it from her. </sentence><sentence id="405">She never said she had given it to me. </sentence><sentence id="406">What happened to the young man I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="407">He was in a <span class="interior space">cell</span> next to hers and she told me later that he was being beaten every single day and she heard him scream but otherwise I don't know what happen to the family his family or to him. </sentence><sentence id="408">Now we stayed a few days at that <span class="building">farm house</span> and the the

</sentence><sentence id="409">And one night he said it was safe. </sentence><sentence id="410">So we left in groups of...1 only can remember that I left with my mother and my younger sister, and then other...the other people would leave at a different hour. </sentence><sentence id="411">We made it to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">We walked across the <span class="dlf">border</span> in the dark. </sentence><sentence id="413">We went through <span class="env feature">rivers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">We...we were a mess when we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="415">We made it to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">We did go from the <span class="dlf">border</span> on a little <span

because the Germans were checking identification cards after we had arrived. </sentence><sentence id="419">This...during this whole trip we were so lucky. </sentence><sentence id="420">The luck was with us. </sentence><sentence id="421">If it was unlucky that I had to leave my wonderful <span class="building">home</span> in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, there was something that

journey to the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="country">France</span> cost her something like 60,000 dollars...the equivalent of 60,000, which was a fortune in those days. </sentence><sentence id="437">And she made it all after my father passed away in that <span class="building">shoe store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">And that is a long story how she made it, and Iam not going to go into that right now. </sentence><sentence id="439">But when we left with the passeur to go back to go to the southern part of <span class="country">France</span>, we went

</sentence><sentence id="450">I do have to give my mother credit for all this because with her she never took no for an answer as I said before. </sentence><sentence id="451">We...my sisters and I have often spoken to...if God forbid my Mother would have passed away and my Father would have lived, we would never have gotten out of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, because my father

</sentence><sentence id="484">The screams of those people I will never forget as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="485">We were spared because we were Protestant. </sentence><sentence

went there and...went with my brother-in-law, my older sister's husband, and there was no problem getting a...a....a transit visa for my mother, for my two sisters, and for myself. </sentence><sentence id="502">They would not give it to my brother-in-law because Hitler had made a pact with with Franco that no military age person would go through because they knew they would join the Allied Armies. </sentence><sentence id="503">So my brother-in-law couldn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="504">We tried and tried and tried. </sentence><sentence id="505">They wouldn't give it to him. </sentence><sentence id="506">I tried my best. </sentence><sentence id="507">I flirted with these Spanish people in that consultate which my mother had told me to do...and I did...but it was to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="508">We even tried to change my brother-in-law's age on his passport with some ink iradicator, but it was so bad it made a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the paper. </sentence><sentence id="509">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="510">We didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="511">My brother-in-law stayed in <span class="populated

about to march in." </sentence><sentence id="515">My mother, my younger sister and I, we went to the <span class="dlf">Spanish border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="516">We went to <span class="populated place">Papinvon</span> and we...I left my brother-in-law in <span class="populated place">Marseille</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">My mother had left my brother-in-law quite a bit of money to see if he couldn't buy himself a transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="518">When we arrived across the <span class="dlf">border</span>, there was a lot of cheering and I think it was November the 10, 1942, when we arrived across the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="519">And all the Spainards were cheering. </sentence><sentence id="520">And there was a Dutch representative from the consulate of <span class="populated place">Madrid</span> at this <span class="building">station</span> who apparently came

there. </sentence><sentence id="526">We took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Madrid</span>, and my sister...my oldest sister was at the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="861">A: Yal. </sentence><sentence id="862">The two Dutch people were taken off this <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and we went on to <span class="populated place">Paramia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="863">I remember it was morning and they played Dutch National Athem for us when we arrived, and everybody was crying. </sentence><sentence id="864">We were very emotional when we heard that because many of us never thought we would ever hear it again. </sentence><sentence id="865">The Governor of that <span class="region">Dutch Guyana</span> was at that time a man by the name of Mr. Kilstra. </sentence><sentence id="866">He was not very keen on having 75 Jewish people come, which was unusual, because the Dutch people had always been very good to their Jewish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="867">And we had never felt any anti-Semitizm in the...while we lived in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="868">But he was not very happy, and he had built what he called a <span class="building">refugee house</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="869">The <span class="building">refugee house</span> was a <span class="populated place">hugh camp</span> with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> around it, and we were not allowed out. </sentence><sentence id="870">I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for 6 months. </sentence><sentence id="871">We...all the women were put in one great big <span class="interior

cots</span>. </sentence><sentence id="872">They separated married couples, some of them for about a year because my mother was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for a year.

mother...mother consented to that. </sentence><sentence id="875">So we were 6 months in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="876">We were made to do <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> work which was unusual in a tropical <span class="country">country</span> at that time because...not that there was anything wrong with doing <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> work, but at that point the Governor made us do it because it was degrading. </sentence><sentence id="877">White people did not do any <span class="interior

that I passed. </sentence><sentence id="884">The reason why I had to take private lessons because they did not have a <span class="building">school</span> there that was on the same level as a <span class="building">lycee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="885">They had lower level <span class="building">high schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="886">After that I worked for a year with the

<span class="country">country</span>, but I do not want you training in <span class="country">England</span>." </sentence><sentence id="891">And she did not want me to go with the occupation forces as a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="892">I did she did give the consent and I did leave for <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, D.C. I was connected with the <span class="building">Dutch Embassy</span> there for...for 2 years. </sentence><sentence id="893">It..it was a difficult period. </sentence><sentence id="894">I came withi 40 dollars in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="895">I had no clothes to speak of. </sentence><sentence id="896">Some seamstress in <span class="region">Dutch Guyana</span> had made me some so-called gorgeous dresses, and when I arrived I looked absolutely hideous. </sentence><sentence id="897">My salary was not very high, but I made ends meet. </sentence><sentence id="898">I lived in a <span class="building">girl's hotel</span>, <span class="building">Meridian Hill Hotel</span> on <span class="dlf">16th Street</span>, which was at that time across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="899">I did slowly get to know some Americans. </sentence><sentence id="900">I could not speak English. </sentence><sentence id="901">I had had 1 year of English and when the Germans marched in, they did away with all the English in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> and increased my German courses. </sentence><sentence id="902">I was...I had...when I was at the <span class="building">lycee</span>, I had 3 hours of German and 3 hours of English and 3 hours of French a week, and they increased it to 6 hours of German and no English. </sentence><sentence id="903">So my German was quite good at the time, but my English was not. </sentence><sentence id="904">When I met some Americans it was interesting the advice I would receive from them. </sentence><sentence id="905">At that point I had hidden my Jewish identify for so long that I was actually afraid to tell people that I was Jewish, and I did not tell them either. </sentence><sentence id="906">So they would ask me why did I leave the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, and I had the same story that the German soldier was running after me, conditions were very bad, and we left it at that. </sentence><sentence id="907">They...the American people I met were all very kind and nice people and they had some very good advice as far as they were concerned for a 20 year old girl who came to this <span class="country">country</span> all by herself. </sentence><sentence id="908">One of the things they told me, and this was told to me at least 10 times by 10 different Americans, that this is a good <span class="country">country</span>, but I better watch out because there is a group of people I want to stay away from because they will cheat you and they will lie to you and I will be the worse of it if 1 believed and got in touch with these people. </sentence><sentence id="909">And I asked them who are these people. </sentence><sentence id="910">And they told me they are the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="911">I was flabbergasted that in a free democratic society they would just lump a whole group together and believe the lies that Hitler was trying to promote. </sentence><sentence id="912">I did argue against them from which I thought was a point of strength because they didn't know I was Jewish and so maybe I thought I had more clout arguing with them from that point of view. </sentence><sentence id="913">But I was, of course, very insecure in my religion. </sentence><sentence id="914">I...uh..I had written to my mother that I...was no way I was going to stay in this <span class="country">country</span> because it was not democratic and it was very prejudiced against Jews and other minorities and that I absolutely could not live here. </sentence><sentence id="915">Now at that time I did have a very poor point of view of the <span class="country">United States</span>.

class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I had no one to turn to. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I was here all by myself and I never felt sorry for myself because I felt so lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Untill this day, I feel that I'm one of the lucky ones because I think that in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> something like...I'm not actually correct that we didn't have something like more than 130,000 Jews and I believe that close to 120,000 Jews were...were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So here I am one of 10,000 Jews who made it. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I am one of the 20 people who left with us, and I'm here to tell this story. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And it is... cannot believe man's inhumanity towards man. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And when I ask American Jewish people, "Why do you go on a vacation to <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1164">How can you have a good time?" </sentence><sentence id="1165">Many of them tell me, "I'm an American. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I have...don't have the feelings that you have." </sentence><sentence id="1167">I said, "But you know Hitler was not against Liny Pajgin. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Hitler was against all the Jewish people and all the minorities and all the people who didn't have blond hair and blue eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And if Hitler had won the war you wouldn't be alive today either. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And we have to fight against injustices towards any kind of people because as long as you're injust toward one, you're injust toward the whole <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1171">It drags the whole <span class="country">country</span> down. </sentence><sentence id="1172">We cannot be that way. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And I have fought and made myself at many times very unpopular because people don't like to hear sad tales. </sentence><sentence id="1174">They like to hear happy tales. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And they don't want to hear about the Holocaust anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They think they know it all. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And maybe the atrocities of the Holocaust are not as important as the history that allowed this Holocaust to happen and we have to work day and night that this doesn't happen again, that we never put ourselves in that position as a <span class="country">nation</span>, that we don't go after one group of people, no matter who they are. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And I think that I have contributed and I hope that my staying alive has had a purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1179">That's all I can say. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And I know for myself I have had the most wonderful life that anyone can have. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And I only hope that many, many people will have as good a life as I have had and stilll have. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So I have and I have this <span class="country">country</span> to thank for it because it has allowed me the freedom with many pitfalls, but it stilll has allowed me the freedom to be my own person. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1254">Q: Did any other Gentilles besides the Catholic family help you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1256">A: Just the...the girl who was my classmade in the <span class="building">lycee</span> who gave me her identification card. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And...and then there was one other young men whom I knew who tutored me for in a <span class="building">chemistry class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1258">When I went to the <span class="building">Jewish lycee</span>, I was behind in...a year of chemistry that I hadn't had, and he was already in <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1259">His name is Amile Meits. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And he came to our <span class="building">house</span> which was against the law of the Germans because Gentiles were not allowed to come to <span class="building">Jewish homes</span> anymore and Jews were not allowed to visit Gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And he came to my <span class="building">house</span> and he tutored me in chemistry so that I would be up to par at the <span class="building">Jewish lycee</span>, and he also tried to ship some of our belongings to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but they got totally lost. </sentence><sentence id="1262">After the war, he wrote me a letter and he said that my love for helping the Jewish people was more than just helping you during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I married a Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1264">And I...I do have to also tell you the <span class="building">lycee</span> was not in in working very long. </sentence><sentence id="1265">I think it existed...I was in it for about 6 months and it never opened up again after that. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And one more thing I really I left out is that the day after we left that the whole <span class="dlf">street</span> was trembling because a <span class="spatial object">Army truck</span> came by at night to pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And we beat them by one day. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Our whole trip was so incredulous because we beat the Germans by one day when we left. </sentence><sentence id="1269">We were never picked up. </sentence><sentence id="1270">We found this wonderful family in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> who helped us, and they probably are not there today anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Then we came to the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="country">France</span> and it worked. </sentence><sentence id="1272">We weren't picked up. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And we came to <span class="country">Spain</span> with the last <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1274">It was all pure luck. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I cannot...I think that if I heard somebody tell this story I wouldn't believe a word of it because it all was just so much luck. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1296">Q: One minor point. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I think you mentioned that your mother after the war found the passeur who had taken the money from you. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: I hate to say it, but that man was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And he lived on the same <span class="interior space">floor</span> as...in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> where an uncle of mine lived who had escaped to <span class="country">Spain</span> and he stayed in <span class="populated place">Madrid</span> because they asked him to work for the <span class="building">Dutch consulate</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So he stayed there the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And my mother looked at the <span class="spatial object">mailbox</span> and she saw this name, recognized it, and she went to his <span class="dlf">door</span>, and she said, "Who are...Do you remember me?" </sentence><sentence id="1306">And the man turned pale. </sentence><sentence id="1307">He said, "Yes, I remember you. </sentence><sentence id="1308">How is your daughter, Liny?" </sentence><sentence id="1309">He even remembered my name. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And then my mother said, "Do you know what you did to us? </sentence><sentence id="1311">Aren't you surprised we are alive?" </sentence><sentence id="1312">He said, "You poor woman, you are totally senile. </sentence><sentence id="1313">You know people like you should not stay alive that long. </sentence><sentence id="1314">You are senile." </sentence><sentence id="1315">And he insisted. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Now my mother was going to make something about it, and we discouraged her. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I don't know if it is right or wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I...I don't know what she could have done, but it would have eaten her heart out. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And money after you save yout life isn't that important. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And we had enough to get by. </sentence><sentence id="1321">We...we were not waiting for that money. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And that was...that was blood money. </sentence><sentence id="1323">That was not money that I would have ever enjoyed having. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So we discouraged her from going after him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
