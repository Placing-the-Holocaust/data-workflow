<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: Tell me about growing up. </sentence><sentence id="23">Did you grow up there? </sentence><sentence id="24">And your very early years, before the Nazis came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: What little I remember, really, in that period: I grew up in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, very uneventfully; a small <span class="populated place">resort town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">From what I remember, what little I remember, a very pleasant environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: You moved at one point. </sentence><sentence id="33">Where did you move to, again, before the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: Well, we moved from <span class="populated place">Lubochnia</span> to a <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> called Zilina(ph). </sentence><sentence id="37">The--my, my father had bought a <span class="building">hotel</span> in, in this <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, in <span class="populated place">Lubochnia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a <span class="building">hotel</span> that was designed to be for German political refugees awaiting the fall of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="39">My father thought that Hitler would not last more than four years, and he wanted to be nearby and have his friends there. </sentence><sentence id="40">Well, by, by 1938, very few people could come out of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">So the <span class="building">hotel</span> wasn't going very well. </sentence><sentence id="42">And at that point, we left the <span class="building">hotel</span> and moved to Zilina(ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: All right. </sentence><sentence id="51">What happened there, when by 1938, "39? </sentence><sentence id="52">Did things change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Well, the -- in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, the Hlinka, Hlinka Guard, which was a fascist group aligned with the Nazis, began harassing Jews and looking for certain people, and my father was one of the people they apparently had on, on some list. </sentence><sentence id="57">It became clear to us that if we didn't leave the  risk -- at least, the risk to my parents -- that the risk was very great. </sentence><sentence id="58">And that at some point, shortly before the German invasion, we tried to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span> into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">It took about a week to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span>, in, in <span class="region">no-man's-land</span> between <span class="country">Poland</span> and, and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">The last time when we -- in <span class="region">no-man's-land</span>, when we went -- were shipped back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, then the Germans were already there, in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">And it was curious that it was the Germans who actually helped us get into <span class="country">Poland</span> at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: How do you mean, helped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, the Germans didn't realize who we were. </sentence><sentence id="71">And my father told them that he was Polish, and that the Poles wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="72">And so they actually carried our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and told the Poles that they had to let us in. </sentence><sentence id="73">And that's how we entered <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Okay, Okay. </sentence><sentence id="79">But you entered <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, we had political refugee status, my father, and we went to <span class="populated place">Katowice</span>, in southern -- in <span class="country">Poland</span>, to await our entry, or the right to leave for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">My father had papers that would have allowed him to go to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">We registered in <span class="populated place">Katowice</span> with the <span class="building">British Consul</span> and waited there until we were supposed to be called up to, to leave for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">And it was really on the day when the Germans moved into, into <span class="country">Poland</span>, on September first that we were supposed to be leaving for <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And we actually left. </sentence><sentence id="89">What happened was that the <span class="building">British Consul</span> -- there were quite a number of refugees in our position -- were put on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> chartered by the British to take us to the, to the <span class="region">Balkans</span>, and hopefully, from there to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">But the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> -- the <span class="spatial object">train</span> -- never got very far; because we were bombed by <span class="spatial object">German planes</span> and had to abandon the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> not, not very far from the <span class="dlf">Russian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And at that point, the question was: "What do what do we do next?" </sentence><sentence id="92">My, my father actually went and crossed into, into the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, across the <span class="env feature">Bug River</span>; and came back and decided -- actually, he had crossed over to see whether we should go to the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> -- crossed over and decided that we weren't going to be much better off there than if we stayed in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">So he came back. </sentence><sentence id="94">And we then marched with the refugees on the, on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and were actually taken over by <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> on, on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> near some <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">After a while, we ended up in a <span class="populated place">town</span> more or less in <span class="region">central Poland</span>, called <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and eventually ended up in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Tell us -- by then, you are five. </sentence><sentence id="109">Tell us, if you can -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="113">By then, I'm -- yeah, five. </sentence><sentence id="114">Yes, six. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="119">Tell me what you remember of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Well, <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> was, was -- at least from what I remember initially, or maybe in retrospect -- it's often very hard to keep these things apart. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had never se -- <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> really had a very large  <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, and I've since found out that there were more than twenty thousand Jews in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> -- a long tradition. </sentence><sentence id="124">There were a lot of very religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="125">There were <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> and everything -- things I had never seen before in -- in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, where, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were -- let me see, what else do I remember from the initial period?There was another language -- two languages, in fact: both Yiddish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="127">Initially -- again, until things, until 1941, "42, things were not all that bad. </sentence><sentence id="128">It was when the when the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was established, all the Jews were herded into one part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">Food became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="130"><span class="building">Housing</span> became very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="131">We lived in, in one <span class="interior space">room</span> that my father and mother and I shared. </sentence><sentence id="132">And food was very difficult to come by. </sentence><sentence id="133">A lot of, lot of hunger, but still not as serious. </sentence><sentence id="134">There were still a lot of people who lived quite well, who had, had ways of getting food into the, into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, especially in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="135">Things gradually became harder and harder. </sentence><sentence id="136">And the, the <span class="dlf">walls</span> were -- protection was built up much heavier than initially. </sentence><sentence id="137">Initially, it was still possible for people to go in and out, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="138">But after a while that became more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="139">Then, of course, in 1942, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">Most of the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> -- I would think about some close to 20,000 people -- were shipped to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>," and that included my grandparents as well. </sentence><sentence id="141">That was sort of the first really serious killing experience that, that I had. </sentence><sentence id="142">During -- I should note, though, that in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> itself there were -- ifnot daily, certainly sporadic -- killings going on by Germans of people, German guards of Jews on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">At the same time, there appeared to be some sort of normalcy that, that reigned, but then in "42, all of that came to an end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you describe the deportation? </sentence><sentence id="168">What did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, the, the--one morning we were awakened with screaming and shooting outside -- orders in German: "Everybody out!" </sentence><sentence id="172">And whoever wasn't to be out would be would be shot, and apparently a lot of older people, others who couldn't move, were shot. </sentence><sentence id="173">My father, who was, was a very cool person -- that's sort of the, the memory I have -- wasn't going to move until he had shaved and had time to think what to do. </sentence><sentence id="174">And -- actually that's what saved us because he took a group, he took us and a group of people out and marched us to -- he had been in charge of a <span class="building">shop</span> -- and marched us out to the <span class="building">shop</span>, saying that he had orders to protect the <span class="building">shop</span> and keep the, the people in. </sentence><sentence id="175">And that's -- and safeguard a number of people, about twenty people, protecting the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And actually, that's how I was not initially shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="177">The -- we did, however, at the end -- when the, when the Nazis finally caught up with us -- we were all lined up, as everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="178">And you had most of the people marching in, in one direction, and maybe a few hundred people being saved. </sentence><sentence id="179">And we were in that group to  end up in another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, sort of a <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>, also in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">I'm compressing all of this a great deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: It's okay, we have time, we have time. </sentence><sentence id="192">Can you tell us about the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Well, that was basically -- when you, when you think of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> as a substantial section of <span class="populated place">town</span>, the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span> was basically one <span class="dlf">street</span> that was surrounded with barbed wire and, and other -- or maybe two <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">And most of the people worked -- were taken out from there to work in various, various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="197">I didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was there with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="199">And matter of fact, my mother had saved two other children from the--whose, whose parents had --were shipped out in, in "42. </sentence><sentence id="200">Two children had been left, and she took them in. </sentence><sentence id="201">So we ended up then in, in one-half <span class="interior space">room</span>, I think, with, with two other children yet. </sentence><sentence id="202">And -- but life still, put it -- given what was to follow, was still more or less livable, but very -- under very difficult circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="203">Here the killing increased. </sentence><sentence id="204">Every so often, or anybody tried to escape, there would be executions and beatings and other things. </sentence><sentence id="205">The, the worst thing that happened in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> was towards the end, when the -- when -- I think it was in, in "43, or the beginning of "44 -- and I'm -- my dates are wrong -- when there was another Selektion", Basically, you know, when people were shipped off to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="206">What happened there was that all the -- they lined us up on a sort of like a <span class="interior space">playground</span>, and separated all the children, and that became the, the famous massacre of the children in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">I was the only one to survive -- at least of the group that was, was visible. </sentence><sentence id="208">Two other children saved themselves by hiding in the <span class="building">house</span> where the children were taken. </sentence><sentence id="209">But what happened there was that the, the children who were taken out, ended up -- were taken to a <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and killed with hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="210">The <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>; I, I survived that one. </sentence><sentence id="211">That was the worst part in that, that episode. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: How did you survive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Very curious. </sentence><sentence id="232">They had us lined up on the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">The German, the commander of the, of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, was standing in the middle making the decision who was going to live and who was going to die, and they pulled tried to pull me out, and my mother and father more or less pulled the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="234">And finally, they -- my mother, my father and I deci -- went up to the German commander; and I said, in German, that I -- to let me live, because I could work. </sentence><sentence id="235">And in German. </sentence><sentence id="236">And I, I think what, what I saw happen in <span class="populated place">camps</span> a number of times was that they were somehow shocked to find that somebody looked very much like their own children, who spoke the same language the way their own children would speak, was there. </sentence><sentence id="237">They had -- I think they believed a lot of their own propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="238">And he looked at me and  said in German, "Well, let's see," and let me go. </sentence><sentence id="239">The whole thing may have lasted two seconds. </sentence><sentence id="240">And that's how I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: What happened to you after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, after that we ended up in, in a <span class="building">factory</span>, in -- still in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">The surviving people in this group -- I think about two hundred -- were split up, half taken to one <span class="building">factory</span>, another half to another <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">My parents and I ended up in a, in a -- and, incidentally, the two children who were younger than I that we had then died in that also. </sentence><sentence id="256">We, we ended up in a <span class="building">factory</span> where they were making <span class="spatial object">carts</span> for -- <span class="spatial object">wooden carts</span> -- for their <span class="region">Eastern Front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">At that point I had a very interesting job and assignment. </sentence><sentence id="258">The feeling was that, that to survive there, it was important to have something to do; and, and I wasn't even 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="259">So I went to the commander, commander of the German -- of that <span class="populated place">camp</span>; and told him, asked him whether he needed an errand boy. </sentence><sentence id="260">And he looked at me, and he said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="261">And so basically, my, my job in that, in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> consisted of sitting outside his <span class="dlf">door</span> and doing chores that he needed to have done, like getting his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> or taking something to one place or another. </sentence><sentence id="262">The, the job had great advantages because I could hear what was going on and could report back, and I could also alert people to his coming because I would be going ahead of him, running, announcing his coming. </sentence><sentence id="263">And so we had the signal that I would signal. </sentence><sentence id="264">He had -- he wore a hat with a feather; and if 1 went like this to people [gesturing], then he was coming. </sentence><sentence id="265">And -- because if people were seen not working, they would be beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="266">One interesting episode in that connection is that I could listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">He would listen to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, and I would sit <span class="region">outside</span>, and I could hear. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I heard the, the capture of Mussolini," reported it. </sentence><sentence id="269">Of course, nobody believed me. </sentence><sentence id="270">We had no access to radio or any news. </sentence><sentence id="271">But that was -- and the fact that I worked there actually enabled us to have some food, and my father and mother both worked in that <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">But it was one way of, of surviving, and giving me a cer -- certain amount of protection, as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Did things change at some point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Well, what changed at, at some point was that in 1944 the decision was made, I guess, to ship everybody in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we were, we were shipped to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: Can you describe the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>? </sentence><sentence id="300">What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: We were in, in open <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>--put in. </sentence><sentence id="302">Interestingly enough, the Germans--we, we, of course, everybody was worried; and I remember people asking, "Where are we going?" </sentence><sentence id="303">and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="304">The Germans told us we were being shipped to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we once -- one believes what one wants to believe, and I suppose for a while we thought that's where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="306">Again, I remember my father saying initially that the direction of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going to <span class="country">Germany</span>, and then suddenly it, it changed. </sentence><sentence id="307">And that's when he knew that we were, we were going to someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="308">And he knew then we were going to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">Some people jumped out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">The way those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were set up, the, the Germans had machine guns at the end of the, the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and if anybody jumped out, they would just try to lull the people, and I think a number of people jumped out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> on the way to -- and I don't know, know whether they were, were hit or not. </sentence><sentence id="311">The, the most memorable thing was to arrive in, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">It was, you know, from a child's perspective, it was just like having driven into an <span class="building">insane asylum</span>, with people walking back and forth, doing things. </sentence><sentence id="313">We, we saw a group carrying bricks from one place to another and carrying them back. </sentence><sentence id="314">And we, we expected to be met by machine guns, so we had no idea what the, the arrival in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> -- apart from, from this total view of people in these <span class="building">prison</span> -- those prison garb carrying, running different ways, with Kapos(r) with sticks. </sentence><sentence id="315">Was, was a certain calm. </sentence><sentence id="316">We arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="333"> We were, we were lined up and told we were going to go to, to a <span class="building">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">Had our hair shaved. </sentence><sentence id="335">At that point, we expected that things would happen as in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, where we would be immediately executed. </sentence><sentence id="336">What happened was that since our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, since our transfer came from these two <span class="building">factories</span> in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, it was assumed that everybody there was capable of working. </sentence><sentence id="337">And there was no Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="338">That's really the way I came into <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">I would never have -- as a child, would never have gotten in because they would have selected me right out, at my age, at the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">But there was no Selektion. </sentence><sentence id="341">We actually went through the, the <span class="spatial object">sauna</span> -- and I mean that they shaved our hair, disinfected us, and eventually, tattooed us; but I don't think right at the, at the arrival and sent us to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">And we ended up -- this is, of course, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> -- ended up in what used to be the <span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span>, and was still known as the <span class="populated place">Zigeunerlager</span>, the, the "<span class="populated place">Gypsy camp</span>."" </sentence><sentence id="343">That's how I got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Well, the <span class="building">barracks</span> were very much like the <span class="building">barracks</span> you see in pictures that one sees. </sentence><sentence id="360">These big three story <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, very broad, with about ten people fitting into them -- just wooden, wooden boards, very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="361">The first night on arrival, that was, was probably one of the  worst in, in my experience because this was the night when one or two of the people who had been collaborators in our <span class="populated place">camp</span> and had shipped some people to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were beaten very badly. </sentence><sentence id="362">So this was by people who had -- whom they had shipped to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, who in the meantime themselves had become Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="363">The world never changes. </sentence><sentence id="364">But, that was sort of the first, the first night, that experience. </sentence><sentence id="365">That's, you know, the, the sort of initial thing I remember of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">We -- there were some people that I. -- my father knew, who had been shipped out before. </sentence><sentence id="367">There again, my father and some friends thought that the way for me to survive was to try to find something to do. </sentence><sentence id="368">And I went -- or rather, I don't know who went. </sentence><sentence id="369">But at any rate, I managed to get to be the errand boy for the Kapo in the, in the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> and sau -- I don't know what they called it. </sentence><sentence id="370">A place where people... The <span class="interior space">wash rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">And that, again I think, helped because I, I had a certain protection by being there and also knowing when the Selektion process was going to, to happen. </sentence><sentence id="372">Because you could -- in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, the Selektion of people, the Selektion out to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> would usually happen every six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="373">The Germans, with their efficiency, would never repeat things immediately or do things irregularly. </sentence><sentence id="374">So, you could expect things to happen every four to six weeks, and it usually happened with certain people arriving in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">And if you knew that was going to happen and if you were where I was, it gave you a certain amount of protection because you could hide and get out of, out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="376">And that certainly helped me, in some instances, to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="399">What did you do there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: One of the things that I had to do was to go and fetch gas. </sentence><sentence id="401">Not very often, but I think two or three times -- the same gas that was used for the gassing of people -- this Zyklon C gas(r) --to pick it up, for disinfecting purposes, from the <span class="building">crematorium</span> to the, to the <span class="building">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">And that was, and that actually enabled me to go to get out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="403">But basically, just go deliver a piece of paper from one place to another, and hang around. </sentence><sentence id="404">I certainly didn't work very hard. </sentence><sentence id="405">It wasn't, it wasn't a full-time job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: Oh, just a big <span class="building">barracks</span> with, with <span class="spatial object">beds</span> where people -- some were dying, some had...had minor injuries. </sentence><sentence id="710">A lot of people -different thing. </sentence><sentence id="711">Every so often, people would be taken out, people would be released. </sentence><sentence id="712">The Selektion was made of people who were actually taken out and, and killed, without most of us knowing what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="713">They were called out. </sentence><sentence id="714">The Norwegians received packages from the <span class="building">Norwegian Red Cross</span>, or the <span class="building">Swedish Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="715">And befriended me and helped me immensely, with -- especially a man by the name of Fridtjof Nan -- Odd Nansen -- the son of Fridtjof Nansen"(r) who was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- helped me with -- both with food, and also I think with giving food to the people in the <span class="dlf">ward</span> to, to protect me. </sentence><sentence id="716">It was curious. </sentence><sentence id="717">The, the one thing that I remember from that <span class="interior space">ward</span> is something which we -- which people who haven't been in <span class="populated place">camps</span> don't realize. </sentence><sentence id="718">That when all of this terrible tragedy and terrible conditions that were going on, people still had a great sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="719">It, it didn't leave us. </sentence><sentence id="720">Let me give you one example: in this <span class="interior space">hospital ward</span>, we had as a <span class="spatial object">ventilator</span> just a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="dlf">roof</span>, which was plugged up with a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence id="721"><span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, as I said, was about twenty kilometers outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">And when the Allies bombed <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> would fly over <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="723">There's another story to this, which I can tell you later. </sentence><sentence id="724">But at any rate, the bombing, of course, the <span class="spatial object">bombs</span> would fall pretty close. </sentence><sentence id="725">And one day, there, there was a very severe bombing attack, and people were getting out of their <span class="spatial object">beds</span> because of the fear that the <span class="building">barracks</span> would be bombed. </sentence><sentence id="726">And, and there it was all wood and would have been burned. </sentence><sentence id="727">And suddenly there was a tremendous crash of a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span> falling, and a man screaming he's been killed by the <span class="spatial object">bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="728">But what had happened was that the piece of wood that had plugged up the <span class="spatial object">ventilator</span> had fallen down, and just fallen on him. </sentence><sentence id="729">And, you know -- despite this environment we were in -- that whole block of people, maybe a hundred dying people, burst into a roar of laughter which I still remember to this day -- about the fact that this poor man thought he had died already. </sentence><sentence id="730">There were many instances of that going on. </sentence><sentence id="731">The other thing which, in which we took great pride and joy was that when the bombing raids came, the, the German officers" families and influential Germans would hide in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> from the bombing attack. </sentence><sentence id="732">Because the bo -- the the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was known to the Allies; and they avoided bombing it. </sentence><sentence id="733">As a matter of fact, at night they would drop flares around the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, in order not to bomb it. </sentence><sentence id="734">And so it was really the safest place nearby. </sentence><sentence id="735">And that, to us, we were beginning to feel that the war, that we were maybe winning. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: Okay, in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, you tell me that you were befriended by Norwegians -- particularly Odd Nansen. </sentence><sentence id="770">Can you tell me something about him, and about your relationship with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Well, he, he would come and visit various Norwegians in the, in the <span class="building">hospital</span>; and that's how we, we met. </sentence><sentence id="774">He, he was writing a diary in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">I, of course, didn't know about it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="776">I found out after the war. </sentence><sentence id="777">So he, he came by, talked to a lot of people; and then, when he found out that I was there and that I'd come from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he befriended me. </sentence><sentence id="778">And came and visited me almost every week, or maybe even more often and would bring me cookies and try and make sure that I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="779">And brought me ex -- as a matter of fact, brought me paper and a pencil to draw. </sentence><sentence id="780">And what, of course, I didn't know was that he wrote down a lot of things about my experiences at the time. </sentence><sentence id="781">He was a wonderful man, who had -- really a great humanitarian; very much in the tradition of his father, who was Fridtjof Nansen -- the High Commissioner for Refugees during the League of Nations time, after whom the, the Nansen Passport is named. </sentence><sentence id="782">But he, he helped me immensely. </sentence><sentence id="783">I, I think he, he saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="784">He was then shipped out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> shortly before the, the end of the war, when Count Bernadotte"" was able to get the Norwegians and Danes out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and get them to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="785">At that point we, we didn't see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="786">And after the war, when having survived I, I tried to, to find him, couldn't remember his name -- only knew that he, that he had a very famous Norwegian name. </sentence><sentence id="787">But wanted to find him and wanted to thank him. </sentence><sentence id="788">I didn't find him until about 1947 or "48, when my mother read in the newspaper that a book had been published. </sentence><sentence id="789">It was a diary of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> that, among other things dealt with <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="790">And that it was a Norwegian who had published it. </sentence><sentence id="791">At that point, we, we wrote to him, asking whether he knew that, who that Norwegian might be who helped me in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="792">And, of course, it was he. </sentence><sentence id="793">There's a great story to this because I -- mail, of course, was very slow in those days, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="794">Food was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="795">We didn't hear from him for -- we didn't receive an answer to the letter for about four or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="796">And one day, there's a knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> in the <span class="building">house</span> where we lived in <span class="country">Germany</span> -- in <span class="populated place">Gottingen</span> -- and up pulled a <span class="spatial object">Norwegian military truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="797">And the soldier came out, and asked whether this was our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="798">And we said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="799">And he said he had a little package for us. </sentence><sentence id="800">And so we said, "Well, give it to us." </sentence><sentence id="801">And he said, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="802">It's, -- we need to carry it." </sentence><sentence id="803">And they -- then a group of Norwegian soldiers jumped out of the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and brought this tremendous <span class="spatial object">crate</span> -- <span class="spatial object">wooden crate</span> -- of food that had been collected by Norwegian children, with a letter from him. </sentence><sentence id="804">And shortly thereafter, he came and actually took me to <span class="country">Norway</span> for a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="805">And -- because he had thought that I had died in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">And the book, in fact, that he published about the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- the diary -- was dedicated to me, among other people, on the assumption that I hadn't survived the -- the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="807">So it was a wonderful reunion when we when we finally got together. </sentence><sentence id="808"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="845">Q: Okay, let's go back to you in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="846">When were you released from the <span class="building">hospital</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: I really wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="850">The camp -- the Germans lost the war before I was released from the <span class="building">hospital</span>, or rather, they had to leave the, the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">Again, this <span class="populated place">camp</span> was to be liquidated, and people were lined up to march out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="852">We, we really couldn't walk, and the people in the <span class="interior space">hospital ward</span> were left behind. </sentence><sentence id="853">And we assumed that they would come in and shoot everybody in our <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, and it was extremely -- I remember the day when people lined up, and then it became extremely quiet. </sentence><sentence id="854">And you couldn't hear anything. </sentence><sentence id="855">You only -- and we waited, basically, on the assumption that any minute now they would, they would come in. </sentence><sentence id="856">Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="857">And of all the people in that, in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, I probably could move better. </sentence><sentence id="858">By then, I had a crutch; and I could move on, on one leg. </sentence><sentence id="859">And finally, I went out to look. </sentence><sentence id="860">With all this silence. </sentence><sentence id="861">And the machine gun on the <span class="dlf">gate</span> of the--overlooking the, the sort of <span class="dlf">plaza</span> in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was empty, for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="862">And the Germans had left. </sentence><sentence id="863">You -- by then, you could hear already the rumbling of artillery in -- in the background. </sentence><sentence id="864">And there wasn't a soul to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="865">Nothing happened for a while, except, you know, we, we realized that maybe we were, we were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="866">The shooting came closer. </sentence><sentence id="867">Eventually the <span class="dlf">gates</span> swung open and Russian troops came in. </sentence><sentence id="868">And they began ringing the, the <span class="spatial object">camp bell</span> to say that we were free. </sentence><sentence id="869">There was -- that, that was freedom. </sentence><sentence id="870">And the first thing, of course, that happened then was that anybody who could move stormed into the German, where the Germans kept provisions, and tried to grab as much food as, as possible. </sentence><sentence id="871">I had eaten so little in that time that I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="872">I remember the only thing I took was a pickle. </sentence><sentence id="873">I found a pickle, and, and I ate it. </sentence><sentence id="874">And maybe that's what saved me, actually, because people died by simply eating too much, and not having eaten for a long time and not being used to, to the food. </sentence><sentence id="875">As a matter of fact, I'll come back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="876">I couldn't eat for anything very much, for weeks after my, my liberation. </sentence><sentence id="877">Just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="878">Could barely eat anything more than a piece of, of dry bread, but a lot of people ate and got extremely sick. </sentence><sentence id="879">The Russians did nothing, really. </sentence><sentence id="880">There was no -- unlike from what I hear about the <span class="populated place">camps</span> that were liberated by the British or American troops, or French troops, there was no doctors sent in. </sentence><sentence id="881">No first aid. </sentence><sentence id="882">No supplies. </sentence><sentence id="883">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="884">We were just simply told we were free, and we could go. </sentence><sentence id="885">And the direction we should go was away from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, because <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was still not, not captured. </sentence><sentence id="886">This was about April 20th or so, 1945."* </sentence><sentence id="887">And so whoever could move, went. </sentence><sentence id="888">And there was with me in, in the <span class="building">hospital</span> a, a Pole who he and I got up, and we decided to try to...to move, to...to go, leave the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="889">And we got out into <span class="populated place">Sachsen</span> -- into <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span>, the <span class="populated place">town</span> where <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> was, and there the <span class="building">houses</span> were empty. </sentence><sentence id="890">The Germans had, left their <span class="building">homes</span>, left food almost on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and, and had left, and we sort of  5 moved from one place to another, from one of these <span class="building">homes</span> to another, until we came upon a group of the -- a <span class="region">Polish division</span> under Russian command -- the <span class="region">First Division</span> <span class="populated place">Kosciusko</span>". </sentence><sentence id="891">And by then we had accumulated a group of people, about five or six people, all from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="892">The -- the Polish soldiers saw me, assumed I was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="893">I, I spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="894">And didn't --they had to speak German at the time, of course. </sentence><sentence id="895">And asked me whether I was from <span class="country">Poland</span>; and I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="896">And then they said, well, they'll take me to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="897">And so what they did was take me along in with their group. </sentence><sentence id="898">And their -- this particular group was the scout company of the <span class="populated place">First Polish Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="899">And I became the mascot of the, of the <span class="populated place">Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">I was given a horse and a, a little <span class="spatial object">cart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="901">As a matter of fact, they had, they had captured a <span class="building">German circus</span>, and this was a small <span class="spatial object">pony</span>. </sentence><sentence id="902">I had my <span class="spatial object">pony</span>, and moved with the troops. </sentence><sentence id="903">And actually, I always say I helped capture <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> with my troops because we actually moved on <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="904">And I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> before <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> fell, because the, the troops came in. </sentence><sentence id="905">The Russians had already advanced, Russian troops had already moved in. </sentence><sentence id="906">But I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> before <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> fell, on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> -- actually, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> with Polish, troops. </sentence><sentence id="907">It's never mentioned that Polish troops were in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> among the conquerors, and it, it's true. </sentence><sentence id="908">We, we were there. </sentence><sentence id="909">We, actually, until <span class="country">Germany</span> surrendered I was -- we were still following German troops beyond <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="910">After the fall of <span class="country">Germany</span>, the Polish troops were being moved back to, to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="911">And I was moving back with them. </sentence><sentence id="912">And we initially moved to a, to a <span class="building">military garrison</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> called <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="913">It's a <span class="populated place">town</span> in, in <span class="country">Poland</span>, where I've spent some time until a, a Jewish-Polish soldier in my company took me out one day and took me to a <span class="building">Jewish orphanage</span> in <span class="populated place">Otwock</span> and left me there, and there were a lot of Jewish children in that in the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, that we -- for the first time, I sort of began to live something of a, of a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="914">The period in the <span class="building">orphanage</span> is interesting -- again, as a sort of historical footnote -- because our <span class="building">orphanage</span> was an <span class="building">orphanage</span> run by the Jewish Bund, which was a socialist communist Jewish organization that didn't want people to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="915">At the same time, the Zionist group -- the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za'ir(tm)" -- had more or less infiltrated the <span class="building">orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="916">And there was one counselor who got all of us who wan -- those who wanted to go to, to <span class="country">Israel</span> -- it was then <span class="country">Palestine</span> -- put the names on a list. </sentence><sentence id="917">And would then run away, one by one, to the <span class="populated place">Zionist kibbutz</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, or <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">And from -- and would be shipped from there to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and I signed up for this group. </sentence><sentence id="919">Problem was that, that I was the only one who had been in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and in other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="920">And so the decision was made that I should run away last because I would be interviewed on newsreel and on radio about my <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they thought that if I ran away it would blow the  6 whole operation. </sentence><sentence id="921">So I was put on to, on the list. </sentence><sentence id="922">The list was sent to the Jewish Agency for Palestine, to <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, but I was told that I would be told when to run away, but I would be the last person. </sentence><sentence id="923">In the meantime, something unbelievable happened. </sentence><sentence id="924">My mother had survived the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="925">And my brother, my mother's brother was here in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="926">And they began looking for me all over, of course, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="927">And they couldn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="928">My mother never gave up hope that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="929">Everybody told her, "It's impossible that he survived." </sentence><sentence id="930">But she believed that I survived. </sentence><sentence id="931">And among other places where they looked, of course, was the Jewish Agency for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="932">Somebody in the Search Bureau of the Jewish Agency for Palestine noticed that there was a child in an <span class="building">orphanage</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> who was going to be coming to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, who met the description of the child that the woman was looking for in <span class="country">Germany</span> and notified my uncle in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="933">And that's how they, how I was eventually reunited with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="934">What happened was that, the, the -- it wasn't all that easy to leave <span class="country">Poland</span>, you know, I had no papers or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="935">And my mother was in <span class="country">Germany</span> at the time, in the, in the <span class="region">British zone</span>, so the American Joint Distribution Committee basically smuggled me out in December of 1946 from <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> to the <span class="region">American zone</span>, and then the American <span class="region">zone</span> to the <span class="region">British zone</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, until I was reunited with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="936">And there was the Joint operated with the <span class="spatial object">Brichah</span>" |, which had bribed a lot of people on the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="937">And that's how I got to <span class="country">Germany</span> in "46. </sentence><sentence id="938">That was really three years after I'd been separated from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="939">But the -- I think the most telling thing is, is the faith that my mother had that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="940">And there was no way for anybody to shake her in the belief that, that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="941">And I, I really never looked. </sentence><sentence id="942">I assumed that if my mother or father were alive, they were going to find me. </sentence><sentence id="943">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1039">Q: Can you describe that meeting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1041">A: It's emotionally a little hard, except to say that, that we met on the <span class="building">railroad station</span> outside of <span class="populated place">G6ttingen</span>, which is in <span class="region">northern Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1042">She had gone to a, a <span class="building">station</span> earlier, and I recognized her, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: You'll be surprised to hear it when I say to <span class="building">school</span>, as a good academic. </sentence><sentence id="1048">No, what I -- what we did was <span class="populated place">Gottingen</span> was my mother's <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1049">My father and mother had a, had different meeting places that they had agreed upon if they survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="1050">One was in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1051">My mother had actually gone back to <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> -- walked from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1052">She was liberated out not far from <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Walked, got back, mainly walking, into <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> looking for us; escaped out of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, left <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> just a few days becau -- before the pogrom after the war,  7 got back to <span class="populated place">Gettingen</span> because that's where, where she had grown up, where my great grandparents lived, and waited for my father. </sentence><sentence id="1054">I came, and I had really no schooling whatsoever, and we lived in <span class="populated place">Gottingen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1055">So I was put -- I was taught a year of private tutoring, and then enrolled in the <span class="building">high school</span> in <span class="populated place">Gottingen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And was the -- the only Jewish kid in -- in <span class="building">school</span> in that <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the only Jewish kid that anybody in that <span class="populated place">town</span> -- at least, the children -- had seen. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Which was, in itself, an experience because they always expected to find somebody with a long nose, and, you know, all the caricatures out of the <span class="building">Stiirmer</span> and other German newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Initially it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1059">One, one is -- ort of comes with a certain hatred to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of the people who did all of this. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And initially, I had this desire of sitting on my <span class="interior space">balcony</span> to take a machine gun and shoot everybody who -- then, gradually, you meet the children and their parents; and the abstract of the Germans becomes the reality of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And you sort of gradually shed the hatred, and you integrate in the <span class="populated place">town</span> and in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1062">It helped to -- we spoke about <span class="populated place">Nansen</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="1063">One of the things that I didn't mention was that when Nansen's book was published in German he gave the proceeds for that book to German refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And his whole approach to the Holocaust and to the problem was one of reconciliation. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And that made a great impression on me, living in that <span class="env feature">environment</span> and seeing people who hadn't participated in these killings. </sentence><sentence id="1066">But I, I never really felt at <span class="building">home</span> in any sense, in, in <span class="country">Germany</span>; although I was treated well. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Made a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Then, in 1951, I, I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1069">I came initially alone, just to stay for one year. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Came to live with my uncle, who lived in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And never went back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
