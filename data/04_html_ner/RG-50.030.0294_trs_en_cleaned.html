<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: No, you don't need to spell them because it's on the <span class="spatial object">slate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">And then I'd like to you tell me a little bit about your childhood and background before the war. </sentence><sentence id="9">Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family. </sentence><sentence id="14">My birth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though. </sentence><sentence id="15">My mother was a full-time mom. </sentence><sentence id="16">She used to sing in the <span class="dlf">path</span> when she was young, but her career ended before I was born, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="17">My dad was a locksmith and son of | of 13 children, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="18">Naturally, he had to go to work to support his family. </sentence><sentence id="19">That's why he didn't finish <span class="building">school</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="20">Eventually when he married my mom, he graduated from <span class="building">high school</span>, became a locksmith to survive and to earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and going to <span class="building">night school</span>, he became an architect. </sentence><sentence id="21">So I was raised in a middle class family. </sentence><sentence id="22">Very, very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="23">I had a sister, was one year older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="24">We lived in a big <span class="building">apartment house</span> belonged to my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="25">The entire family, over 18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day. </sentence><sentence id="26">Naturally, as you live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise, and this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers. </sentence><sentence id="27">Now, I was playing violin since I was four and a half years old. </sentence><sentence id="28">I remember my first <span class="spatial object">violin</span> was bigger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="29">I couldn't hold the <span class="spatial object">violin</span> properly. </sentence><sentence id="30">I recall the tortured nights when they put cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on the <span class="spatial object">violin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32"> I never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in heaven when I start playing particularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, my uncle, my youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was four people and I was playing violin. </sentence><sentence id="34">Of course, we were playing for friends of our parents. </sentence><sentence id="35">I would rather be outside playing tennis or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="36">But this was a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked it actually. </sentence><sentence id="37">But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I  want to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="38">I don't want to, would like to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="39">I don't want to be a musician. </sentence><sentence id="40">I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never understand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing her in the heart. </sentence><sentence id="41">There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of rebellion, a quiet rebellion. </sentence><sentence id="42">But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start practicing again. </sentence><sentence id="43">I was going to <span class="building">school of music</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">Eventually I graduate ... in <span class="building">academy of music</span>, and I was full fledged violinist. </sentence><sentence id="45">In the meantime, my father was involved in expansion of a <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">This was a <span class="building">Catholic high school</span> where the principal was a bishop. </sentence><sentence id="47">I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in <span class="interior space">hallways</span>, accompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">To me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here. </sentence><sentence id="49">We lived in the outside of <span class="region">area</span> where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: It was <span class="building">modern edifice</span> and there were no Jewish people around there. </sentence><sentence id="51">So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though. </sentence><sentence id="52">I did understand Yiddish but I could never speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="53">And one day, going back to the principal of the <span class="building">high school</span>, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now that you have to enter <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">What you think of my son considered being a student in your <span class="building">high school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="55">He said "no problem." </sentence><sentence id="56">As soon as he passes the pre-entrance exam, he accepted. </sentence><sentence id="57">There is no problem. </sentence><sentence id="58">But then my dad replied, but this is a <span class="building">Catholic school</span> and we're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="59">So, ... the principal replied. </sentence><sentence id="60">We prefer a Jewish student in a <span class="building">Catholic high school</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="61"> Believe it or not, I started studying hard. </sentence><sentence id="62">I was a good student and I passed exam and the reality came through. </sentence><sentence id="63">I became the first Jewish student in the highly <span class="building">Catholic school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">Well, my days in <span class="building">high school</span> were extremely happy. </sentence><sentence id="65">They were the best years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="66">I never felt I'm different. </sentence><sentence id="67">I didn't look different, but on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, kids in the <span class="region">area</span> knew who I was. </sentence><sentence id="68">They called me, you dirty Jew. </sentence><sentence id="69">You filthy Jew, for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="70">But my <span class="building">high school</span> I was never approached like this. </sentence><sentence id="71">I was respected by my colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="72">I think they liked me. </sentence><sentence id="73">I was excellent student. </sentence><sentence id="74">I was even assigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor my colleagues from the same <span class="building">class</span> that didn't do so well, and all of them went through and passed the exams. </sentence><sentence id="75">So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in helping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not because they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="76">And, I was very active in <span class="building">French club</span> which I organized. </sentence><sentence id="77">I was very active in an <span class="building">art club</span> which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was nominated by the director of the <span class="building">musical department school</span> to participate in our symphony orchestra in <span class="building">high school</span>, to a point on one day we had a contest in our <span class="populated place">town</span> of different symphony orchestras in different <span class="building">high schools</span> and this took place in one big <span class="building">theaters</span> in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like today and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then. </sentence><sentence id="78">She seen certain things,  you know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her this kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the <span class="dlf">road</span> of my future. </sentence><sentence id="79">I was just insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my mom didn't want me to talk about it about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">And there were different days you respected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="81">Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made quiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="82"> Anyway, my <span class="building">school</span> days were really fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="83">Sundays was customarily thing that all <span class="building">boys high school</span> all in uniforms would marching to <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">I was in front with the band. </sentence><sentence id="85">I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the <span class="building">band</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then when we arrived in the <span class="building">church</span>, 800 or so students, went up to the <span class="building">church</span> and my <span class="dlf">road</span> led to the choir, and I was playing violin with the choir. </sentence><sentence id="87">Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the rituals with the prayers for eight years I was in <span class="building">school</span> there and I felt that I'm Catholic, except I was not baptized. </sentence><sentence id="88">I had <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span> at <span class="building">home</span> next to Hanukkah. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="89">And I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="90">No one making fun of this. </sentence><sentence id="91">But then here and there in the <span class="populated place">city</span> when I went to the <span class="dlf">park</span> or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks, and knowing who I was. </sentence><sentence id="92">One day I remember I was little. </sentence><sentence id="93">We went to the <span class="dlf">park</span>, wintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a <span class="spatial object">sled</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was on the <span class="spatial object">sled</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">He was pulling me on the <span class="spatial object">sled</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man young in his 20s or so. </sentence><sentence id="97">It was a scene, a scene I never forget. </sentence><sentence id="98">Students of the <span class="building">local university</span>, <span class="building">Catholic university</span> attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side curls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades. </sentence><sentence id="99">They are cutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear. </sentence><sentence id="100">Blood was flowing and I never forgot. </sentence><sentence id="101">I was a young kid. </sentence><sentence id="102">But they seen us watching them from a distance. </sentence><sentence id="103">They ran toward us, tried to attack us. </sentence><sentence id="104">But my dad's employee was very fast, athletic and so on, he pulled that <span class="spatial object">sled</span> fast and they were falling, you know, in distance and couldn't reach us. </sentence><sentence id="105">But eventually, they blocked our <span class="dlf">path</span>, you know, and they pinned us against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">He made a mincemeat out of them. </sentence><sentence id="107">He beat them so up, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="108">The fact that we were attacked meant nothing. </sentence><sentence id="109">I think he put to <span class="building">jail</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="110">This was one episode I remember. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="111">But this never happened in my <span class="building">school</span> though. </sentence><sentence id="112">In <span class="building">school</span>, I was person, that I was not a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="113">I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by everyone. </sentence><sentence id="114">That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="115"> And, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with my <span class="building">high school</span> and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me survive. </sentence><sentence id="116">So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: When was that incident with the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: This was probably in about "32, "34, 1933, "34, about five years or so before the war. </sentence><sentence id="119">This was not an isolated incident. </sentence><sentence id="120">There were more incidents like this from then on. </sentence><sentence id="121">There was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in "33. </sentence><sentence id="122">Then you seen people very traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="123">In front of <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>, Polish people standing with signs "do not buy from the Jews, they steal your money." </sentence><sentence id="124">And in spite of this, many people going to <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>, and then they are leaving the <span class="building">stores</span> they were someone taking their pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in those and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And I seen all those things. </sentence><sentence id="126">I was already confused. </sentence><sentence id="127">Here I am in <span class="building">Catholic high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">I thought I was Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="129">And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing. </sentence><sentence id="130">We are not a religious family although my parents had a <span class="building">kosher home</span>, for one reason. </sentence><sentence id="131">All the Jews had <span class="building">kosher home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic. </sentence><sentence id="133">Meat was not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some place in a <span class="building">barn</span>, didn't know how hygienic was done. </sentence><sentence id="134">So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but that's the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="135">But otherwise, we are not religious. </sentence><sentence id="136">But to explain yet my parents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they were not religious I say. </sentence><sentence id="137">Once a year we going to the little <span class="building">Synagogue</span> was actually somebody's like <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, where the Jews were praying all day long. </sentence><sentence id="138">I remember that I was little boy then. </sentence><sentence id="139">I couldn't wait until the service was over. </sentence><sentence id="140">There was so stuffy. </sentence><sentence id="141">There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the kids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are allowed to eat. </sentence><sentence id="142">You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child, you know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know, I remember until today. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire a teacher which they call a Rebbe. </sentence><sentence id="144">Rebbe is not a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="145">It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings, you know, and the religious laws and so on. </sentence><sentence id="146">And he was coming, I don't recall, three or four times a week to my <span class="building">home</span>, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was reading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know. </sentence><sentence id="147">I was turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know. </sentence><sentence id="148">And when he woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even. </sentence><sentence id="149">But, I got the touch of it anyway, you know. </sentence><sentence id="150">Not that I learned anything from him. </sentence><sentence id="151">But there is somethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not very comfortable being in a <span class="building">Synagogue</span> because I didn't grow up in that kind of surroundings you know. </sentence><sentence id="152">But I knew who I was. </sentence><sentence id="153">Then since there was a <span class="building">Catholic schools</span> and there was so many other Jewish students in different <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">None Catholic but <span class="building">state schools</span> who didn't had no formal Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="155">So once a week one of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our <span class="building">school</span> <span class="building">Catholic school</span> teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from  <span class="country">Egypt</span> and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less were not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report. </sentence><sentence id="156">But I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the New Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two grades. </sentence><sentence id="157">And this was very happy solution to me until summer of "39, prior to September 1, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="158">Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">We invade <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews belittle the rumors. </sentence><sentence id="161">All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to cut short vacation and come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Sure enough, September 1, "39 war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="163">Polish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="164">The whole army fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="165">Our government left <span class="country">Poland</span>, first to escape, and only one that stood up yet was <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, was defending self for several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="166">And <span class="country">Germany</span> have a hell of a time, the whole of <span class="country">Poland</span> was invaded already and <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was still fighting. </sentence><sentence id="167">In the meantime the Germans entered our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">First thing they did, all the Jews have to register. </sentence><sentence id="169">All the Jews have to give up their possessions. </sentence><sentence id="170">Their music instruments, <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, <span class="spatial object">grand piano</span>, furs, jewelry, <span class="building">libraries</span>, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give it up. </sentence><sentence id="171">And of course, means of communications, <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> and radio. </sentence><sentence id="172">Germans were afraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe. </sentence><sentence id="173">So we're not allowed to have the <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, and one day I remember my dad came <span class="building">home</span> bloodied up. </sentence><sentence id="174">He was beaten by the Pole and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="175">He was caught on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">He was there to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a prepay and sent him <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">When I seen this, I seen what was to come here. </sentence><sentence id="178">| recall we sitting together, the whole family at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, discussing what should we do. </sentence><sentence id="179">It was too late to run. </sentence><sentence id="180"><span class="region">West</span> we couldn't go, wanted us to know that <span class="country">Russia</span> divided <span class="country">Poland</span> with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="181">The Soviet Army actually came from the <span class="region">East</span> going West and they stopped at the <span class="env feature">River Bug</span> and the German Army stopped at the <span class="env feature">River Bug</span> too and our <span class="populated place">town</span> was slightly west of the <span class="env feature">River Bug</span> so we were at the fortune to be under German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="182">Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go eastward, to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="183">With the blessing of my family, I took a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">My parents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and money didn't mean nothing. </sentence><sentence id="185">So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially Soviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out. </sentence><sentence id="186">There was not documents except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach destination <span class="region">far east</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">A little <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Rovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">Why do you go to Rovno?Rovno was a <span class="populated place">city</span> where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I thought at least I find somebody a relative of course. </sentence><sentence id="189">I arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="190">My ultimate goal was to enter the <span class="building">school</span> there and study medicine. </sentence><sentence id="191">But I was not accepted, maybe as much as good as I thought I will be. </sentence><sentence id="192">Mainly, because food was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="193">Staying in this small, <span class="interior space">cramped quarters</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="194">He was married. </sentence><sentence id="195">Had one boy, baby boy, and I know it was very difficult for them. </sentence><sentence id="196"> So I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, the Germans call <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>, which was a big <span class="populated place">city</span>, about 250,000 people, site of <span class="building">university</span>, formally under the jurisdiction of <span class="country">Austria</span>, <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">Many intelligent people spoke German, and it was just a beautiful <span class="populated place">city</span> and I was very fortunate to take my pre-entrance exam and be accepted in <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">Now you have to understand, that I was a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="199">I had nothing with me. </sentence><sentence id="200">I had no money. </sentence><sentence id="201">I had no clothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="202">But I still felt ... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an obligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too. </sentence><sentence id="203">I always wanted to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="204">So I was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the <span class="interior space">school cafeteria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">I cleaned the <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">I was getting three meals and then knowing the people, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and in a <span class="interior space">room</span> for students, like a <span class="building">dormitory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">We became good friends and I was doing well in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: I was 19. </sentence><sentence id="308">And through 1940 I was doing nothing but studying. </sentence><sentence id="309">I wasn't hungry no more, and that's a time that we didn't have no communication with my <span class="building">home</span>, <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">I was very bothered with the fact that I didn't know what was going on with my parents and my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was no way you could communicate there. </sentence><sentence id="312">I sent a few messages through people, peasants they used to smuggle items going one way or the other to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, but allegedly they never received letters from me, which I later found out. </sentence><sentence id="313">One day who knocks on my <span class="dlf">door</span>? </sentence><sentence id="314">I open the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">Who is there? </sentence><sentence id="316">My dad. </sentence><sentence id="317">He swam through the <span class="env feature">River Bug</span> and being pursued by the Germans and the Russians, arrested by the Russians as a spy and he bought his way out, explained he was not a spy, a Jew looking for his son. </sentence><sentence id="318">They let him go. </sentence><sentence id="319">Happened to be a Jewish officer understand. </sentence><sentence id="320">He came to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">He found me and looked at me and he was crying because I never looked so dilapidated, so abandoned like. </sentence><sentence id="322">And I didn't have a coat. </sentence><sentence id="323">I didn't have a blanket. </sentence><sentence id="324">At night I covered myself with my overcoat, my blanket, but I was not cold. </sentence><sentence id="325">But he didn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do family, and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here. </sentence><sentence id="326">At least nobody is going to kill me here. </sentence><sentence id="327">Nobody was going to shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="328">I still get my  education and I asked him maybe to stay with me, and we looked for ways to bring my mother and my sister to us. </sentence><sentence id="329">There was no way. </sentence><sentence id="330">My dad refused to do that. " </sentence><sentence id="331">There was no way to do that." </sentence><sentence id="332">And he is stay with me for a few days only. </sentence><sentence id="333">I remember today, he sat on my <span class="spatial object">coat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">A button was missing. </sentence><sentence id="335">He said, if your mother would see that she would be very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="336">And he got a button someplace and a thread and sew the button on my coat. </sentence><sentence id="337">I never forget those little things ... Then we parted...while I thought I would never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="338">But the meantime life was going on. </sentence><sentence id="339">I was going to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">1941, July, war again. </sentence><sentence id="341"><span class="country">Germany</span>, in spite of their pact with the <span class="country">Soviet Russia</span>, they invade <span class="region">Eastern Poland</span> and first thing what happened, <span class="country">Ukraine</span> students in the <span class="building">dormitory</span>, Knew who was the Jewish student. </sentence><sentence id="342">They grabbed me, one of my good friends, Ukrainian, grabbed me beating the hell out of me. </sentence><sentence id="343">Forced me to scrub the <span class="interior space">floor</span> of a <span class="building">pub</span> they had opened up for German officers. </sentence><sentence id="344">From then I was taken to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> in <span class="dlf">Janowska street</span> in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">It was not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, it was a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, but the way they treated us was just like <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">We lying on <span class="spatial object">wooden boxes</span> really. </sentence><sentence id="347">Not in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, <span class="spatial object">boxes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">There was nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="349">And we had to be on a <span class="dlf">field</span> at 5 am. </sentence><sentence id="350">wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="351">If you didn't stand straight, they beat you. </sentence><sentence id="352">They kick you from the front, from the back, from the side. </sentence><sentence id="353">You couldn't go down or they would shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="354">So the awareness of not to go down, the beating always kept me aware of it, to stand up and I was numb. </sentence><sentence id="355">And after a while I didn't feel the beating even and then maybe at 7am. </sentence><sentence id="356">or so we marching to the <span class="populated place">city</span> to work, and after a few days I thought well, there was nothing to expect. </sentence><sentence id="357">I run away. </sentence><sentence id="358">And, where you going to go? </sentence><sentence id="359">I run away to the <span class="building">dormitory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">That's the only place I knew. </sentence><sentence id="361">However, I found three of my colleagues, Jewish students, hiding in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">How they escape I don't know, because they went through the <span class="building">building</span> very thorough, using the Ukrainian police with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="363">We decided to go eastward. </sentence><sentence id="364">The Russians were still not too for from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, so hiding, going to the <span class="dlf">fields</span> at night or so. </sentence><sentence id="365">We try to stop some of the <span class="spatial object">Russian trucks</span> so they can maybe pick us up so we can go with them east to <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">Well, they pointed their guns to us. </sentence><sentence id="367">They didn't know who we were. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were afraid too. </sentence><sentence id="369">They were running away themselves. </sentence><sentence id="370">So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the day, especially through the <span class="env feature">forest</span> so we would not be visible. </sentence><sentence id="371">We reached the <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Zolochev</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was a <span class="populated place">town</span> of about 35,000 people, I would say 80 percent Jews. </sentence><sentence id="373">With my luck, wouldn't you believe we walked in at a time when there was a big pogrom taking place. </sentence><sentence id="374">Right away we were caught by the <span class="country">Ukraines</span>, brought us to a <span class="dlf">square</span>, <span class="dlf">town square</span> and put in front of a small <span class="building">building</span> which was the <span class="building">administrative building</span>, I understand. </sentence><sentence id="375">Here in front of us were bodies of Jews, piled one on top of each other, dead. </sentence><sentence id="376">They said to line up, four of us, with hands up, and there were about few thousand maybe 2000 to 3000 spectators in the <span class="dlf">town square</span>, mostly <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">And we seen the SS or Gestapo, I don't remember which. </sentence><sentence id="378">I think it was SS and <span class="spatial object">firing squad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">Before you knew you were there, right there and we supposed to be executed. </sentence><sentence id="380">Well, you know, this moment my whole childhood went through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="381">I close my  eyes. </sentence><sentence id="382">I seen everything. </sentence><sentence id="383">I remember first time, I recall any event which was a funeral when I was five years old. </sentence><sentence id="384">From then on, my childhood, my sister, my parents, my <span class="building">high school</span>, the principal, the bishop, everything until this moment and like a movie. </sentence><sentence id="385">I said, that's a very short life though. </sentence><sentence id="386">And I didn't hear nothing. </sentence><sentence id="387">I just became totally numb. </sentence><sentence id="388">Maybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you were facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="389">I was never a victim of execution. </sentence><sentence id="390">So you don't know how to behave. </sentence><sentence id="391">It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't hear a thing. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I was totally frozen. </sentence><sentence id="393">There were four of us lined up and I was second from the left. </sentence><sentence id="394">And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly opened my eyes, slowly. </sentence><sentence id="395">I thought, I cannot be dead. </sentence><sentence id="396">Its so quiet and peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="397">Where am I? </sentence><sentence id="398">Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I seen my colleague to the right. </sentence><sentence id="399">The last one was slumped over on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, so I didn't know if he was dead or not. </sentence><sentence id="400">But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on the right, were standing like myself, erect and still. </sentence><sentence id="401">Slowly I turn more and more and I look around and I see nobody. </sentence><sentence id="402">Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="403">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="404">They looked like Muslims praying, you know. </sentence><sentence id="405">And they were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="406">Making a long story short, I found out that two <span class="spatial object">Russian planes</span> came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="407">One colleague was killed. </sentence><sentence id="408">We believed he was most likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the firing squad. </sentence><sentence id="409">When see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="410">The three of us grab my little <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>, tiny little <span class="spatial object">satchel</span> actually, and run to the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="411">The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">We hid in the <span class="env feature">river</span>, up to our necks. </sentence><sentence id="413">We took some <span class="env feature">bushes</span> to cover our heads. </sentence><sentence id="414">We stayed there at least three or four days or nights. </sentence><sentence id="415">Until we frozen to death. </sentence><sentence id="416">We couldn't stand it no more. </sentence><sentence id="417">We were hungry, exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="418">We didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="419">We're desperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more. </sentence><sentence id="420">So we decided to get out the <span class="env feature">river</span>, and walking toward some <span class="building">buildings</span> we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three more Jews not killed? </sentence><sentence id="421">How comes? </sentence><sentence id="422">You know, we kept walking, walking. </sentence><sentence id="423">I don't know how we happened to -- we walked into a <span class="building">hospital</span>, <span class="building">local hospital</span>, happened to be a <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">Pogrom was over. </sentence><sentence id="425">Whoever was killed was killed. </sentence><sentence id="426">Thousands of people were killed and they accepted us. </sentence><sentence id="427">They fed us. </sentence><sentence id="428">They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and asked us to work in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="429">But I didn't know what happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="430">This was a very close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not. </sentence><sentence id="431">I didn't know how to make contact with the family. </sentence><sentence id="432">So I decided to go back to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>, which was my <span class="building">university</span>, and I thought we knew some Polish people there. </sentence><sentence id="433">Maybe somehow they heard something, what happened to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> at least. </sentence><sentence id="434">So again,  smuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> and I did visit one of the families. </sentence><sentence id="435">They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer some of my message to the family if I know the address. </sentence><sentence id="436">But I didn't know the address. </sentence><sentence id="437">But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">After a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="439">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving around, not freely, but they could move around. </sentence><sentence id="440">They had to be at dusk in their <span class="interior space">quarters</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="441">And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted him to bring me back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the night, so he wouldn't be caught either. </sentence><sentence id="443">He had some false papers on some kind of Polish mission and I went with him back <span class="building">home</span>, leaving my two friends behind, not knowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other. </sentence><sentence id="444">Driving at night, we arrived <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="445">Of course, I found my family not in the original <span class="building">home</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="446">They were moved to a <span class="region">ghetto area</span> which was behind ... the old <span class="populated place">town</span>, the Jews used live there before, was a <span class="dlf">gate entrance</span>. </sentence><sentence id="447">You had to go, pass through, show your ID You go could to work through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> again into the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="448">My father worked as an architect. </sentence><sentence id="449">Again, he worked for the <span class="dlf">German railroad</span>, so right away I was a medical student. </sentence><sentence id="450">But he got me a job on the construction of the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> as a medic. </sentence><sentence id="451">I had a white band with red cross on it. </sentence><sentence id="452">I didn't have nothing else with me. </sentence><sentence id="453">I could do nothing for anybody who got sick. </sentence><sentence id="454">I didn't know nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="455">Anyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="456">And with him every day to construction and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="457">I contact some of my <span class="building">school</span> friends and they were happy to see me I was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="458">They ask me what they can do for me. </sentence><sentence id="459">At that time I didn't know what they could do for me. </sentence><sentence id="460">We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were going through several selections what they used to call. </sentence><sentence id="461">Selection was the means of when the Germans coming to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="462">One night they arrive, maybe one in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="463">They want to have a <span class="spatial object">grand piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">Where we going to get a <span class="spatial object">grand piano</span>? </sentence><sentence id="465">We were not allowed to have a <span class="spatial object">grand piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="466">Remember, in "39 all the Jews have to give up all the <span class="spatial object">musical instruments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="467">So they didn't care where to get a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">Buy it. </sentence><sentence id="469">Where you a going to buy a <span class="spatial object">piano</span> at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money?So the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the morning they went to <span class="populated place">town</span> and they bought a <span class="spatial object">grand piano</span> and delivered a grand <span class="spatial object">piano</span> to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="470">So we got a reprieve. </sentence><sentence id="471">A month later another selection. </sentence><sentence id="472">People were not necessary for the German government to sustain the <span class="spatial object">war machine</span> were eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="473">They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not needed were disappeared actually. </sentence><sentence id="474">They took them by <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they left, no one knew where they went. </sentence><sentence id="475">We were fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="476">We were still together, the whole family until about April of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="477">In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going to move all the Jews outside the <span class="populated place">city</span>, there special <span class="interior space">quarters</span> made for us. </sentence><sentence id="478">It's going to be like a <span class="building">summer home</span> for the Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="479">Little <span class="dlf">gardens</span> we could go till our <span class="env feature">soil</span>, and  0 we still working for them. </sentence><sentence id="480">Whoever is working is going to be working. </sentence><sentence id="481">From about 60 or 70 thousand Jews there were only four thousand Jews left then. </sentence><sentence id="482">Mind you, that many Jews were eliminated during my absence when I went <span class="region">East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">So I came back there was just about 4000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="484">We had to march by the foot about 15 kilometers without belongings to new <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="485">We took place the little -- <span class="populated place">village</span> name was <span class="populated place">Majdan Tatarski</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="486">This was a little <span class="populated place">village</span> of horse thieves and some peasants. </sentence><sentence id="487">They had a little cattle, like a pig or two, dogs, and you know, and they put the Poles and the Jewish in the <span class="interior space">apartment balconies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">You could see a pig on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and they were not very unhappy about it. </sentence><sentence id="489">They were not used to living in an <span class="building">apartment house</span>, and the Jews were in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> not far away from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, about several kilometers away from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and this little <span class="populated place">town</span> was surrounded by empty <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="490">So was at that time no one thought about it that. </sentence><sentence id="491">This was strategically figured out by the Germans because they won't be able to hide. </sentence><sentence id="492">There are all empty <span class="dlf">fields</span> around this little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">Unbeknown to us they are <span class="building">building</span> already a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>, which was only three or four kilometers away from this <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="494">Some of my fathers Polish friends were employed as carpenters, came back and told my father. </sentence><sentence id="495">They are <span class="building">building</span> some there, something very suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="496">We are working on it. </sentence><sentence id="497">We don't know what is it. </sentence><sentence id="498">It is some kind of <span class="building">barracks</span>, but maybe its for the German Army, for the soldier or so. </sentence><sentence id="499">But then they <span class="building">building</span> something like <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>, or something. </sentence><sentence id="500">We don't know what it's for and some of the Polish people say, I bet you they <span class="building">crematorium</span> to burn the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="501">And that's how the rumor started. </sentence><sentence id="502">But where you going to go? </sentence><sentence id="503">There is no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="504">And in January I think, January ... No, no I'm sorry, not January. </sentence><sentence id="505">November 9 was total liquidation of our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="506">Early in the morning the Ukraine Army, not Army, the soldier and the policeman surrounded the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with some Lithuanian policeman too, and they said everybody has to report at different <span class="dlf">gate</span> and they will be deported to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="507">That's all that was said. </sentence><sentence id="508">As my wife said in her statement before, my father built a little hiding place by doubling a <span class="dlf">wall</span> through a hidden <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">We could stay there in, only in standing position. </sentence><sentence id="510">This was not a hiding place for a long lasting type of escape or so, hiding. </sentence><sentence id="511">You could maybe hide there for a few hours or so, a day maybe and that is about all. </sentence><sentence id="512">We see the futility of the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="513">Because the announcement you could hear through the <span class="spatial object">loudspeakers</span> while were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="514">Anybody found hiding after such and such a time, 7 am will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="515">So your only time to escape now is to get out now. </sentence><sentence id="516">My parents decided to leave and go. </sentence><sentence id="517">They want me to save myself. </sentence><sentence id="518">I took Lucine my friend at that time to my hiding  1 place away from her parents because they had no place to hide at all. </sentence><sentence id="519">After we seen the futility of our hiding place there was no point in doing that, and my parents decided to go with the rest of the people. </sentence><sentence id="520">We escaped from this hiding place, went to the <span class="interior space">attic</span> of the <span class="building">Jewish Administration Building</span> where Lucine's father was still active there, and through the <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="dlf">wall</span> I see my parents and my sister walking with hundreds of people to unknown, to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="521">That's the last sight of my parents I seen. </sentence><sentence id="522">I try to grab my sister to try maybe to escape together, but I didn't know how and where and when. </sentence><sentence id="523">She didn't want to leave my parents. </sentence><sentence id="524">My parents insisted I don't go with them, so I stayed with <span class="building">Lucine</span>, not knowing what we going to do next. </sentence><sentence id="525">And the picture of my parents huddling, holding each other, embracing each other, and the snow falling down called November, early morning, never leave my life, always remember that picture. </sentence><sentence id="526">We still have about two hours time to the deadline. </sentence><sentence id="527">Her father bribed the Ukrainian guard some gold coins and the a <span class="spatial object">fountain pen</span>, a bottle of vodka I think, so he would just ignore us, not to look our way while we try to lift the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, sneak right under the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, escape. </sentence><sentence id="528">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="529">One of the -- one, myself, my wife, her little brother was about eight or nine years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="530">From under the <span class="dlf">wire</span> we run away. </sentence><sentence id="531">We running zig zag fashion. </sentence><sentence id="532">Ukrainian guards and other guards are shooting after us but didn't hit us, and, after running for two, three kilometers we found a Polish peasant who was going <span class="building">home</span> in a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, <span class="spatial object">horse-driven wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">He gave us a <span class="spatial object">lift</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="534">He probably suspected who we were because there was no other people in this <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="535">He didn't said nothing then, nothing to us. </sentence><sentence id="536">He pretend that he didn't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="537">And where we go from here? </sentence><sentence id="538">No plan, no money, no documents of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="539">First thought was to go to a <span class="building">bishop's palace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="540">This was not the bishop who was the principal at the <span class="building">high school</span>, but the gardener at the <span class="building">bishop's palace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">Their son was a friend of mine that I tutored in <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">We knock on their <span class="dlf">doors</span> early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="543">When his mother seen me, she cross herself. </sentence><sentence id="544">She said, My God, where is your mom and dad? </sentence><sentence id="545">I said, they left already. </sentence><sentence id="546">What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="547">We looking for <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">Can you help me? </sentence><sentence id="549">She took us to <span class="building">greenhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">It was nice and warm there but she said, look, you can only stay here until early in the morning because this was Sunday, because next Monday morning the workers coming in they find you hiding, they would denounce you to the Gestapo or the Polish police, and you know what they do with us they find you hiding here? </sentence><sentence id="551">They kill us all. </sentence><sentence id="552">So we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="553">She fed us, gave me a coat and a jacket, of her husband. </sentence><sentence id="554">Her son was missing in the war. </sentence><sentence id="555">She didn't know where he was. </sentence><sentence id="556">He turned out to be later on in the <span class="building">British RAF</span>. </sentence><sentence id="557">He survived the war, but she never forgot what I done for her son. </sentence><sentence id="558">He passed all the grade because I tutoring him, French, Latin, math, history and she felt very bad. </sentence><sentence id="559">She wanted to help but she was scared stiff and I understood. </sentence><sentence id="560">I don't know if situation be reversed how would I behave? </sentence><sentence id="561">Would I have the guts to hide those people under a death threat? </sentence><sentence id="562">In all honest, I don't know if I could do it. </sentence><sentence id="563">I did understand their motivation and their fears but was grateful, they kept me at least overnight to get our  2 thoughts together. </sentence><sentence id="564">And then I remember my dad's associate, a Polish fellow. </sentence><sentence id="565">My dad gave him all the <span class="building">shops</span>. </sentence><sentence id="566">Give to him as a present since he couldn't keep it himself. </sentence><sentence id="567">So he inherit all the tools and the <span class="spatial object">machinery</span>, so on, and he not too far away from the <span class="building">bishop's palace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">So, early in the morning before the workers arrive, we went there and knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span> again, and the same story. </sentence><sentence id="569">He crossed himself. </sentence><sentence id="570">My God, where's your dad? </sentence><sentence id="571">Told him the whole story again. </sentence><sentence id="572">He said, let's go right now through <span class="building">warehouse</span> and nobody will see you. </sentence><sentence id="573">4:47:59 So he hid us for several days there brought us a little food there, and he gave us names of people to contact in the <span class="building">Polish underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="574">Maybe they can do something for us. </sentence><sentence id="575">While I was waiting there hidden with her little brother, my wife, without documents, went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> by <span class="spatial object">train</span>, which was a life-threatening situation, to contact some people who knew how to get the documents. </sentence><sentence id="576">Mind you we have no money, no money. </sentence><sentence id="577">This was name of the game. </sentence><sentence id="578">You're not alive you have no money. </sentence><sentence id="579">She contact some people. </sentence><sentence id="580">She was directed to some <span class="building">hotel</span> where the <span class="spatial object">Polish underground</span> was there and they were manufacturing false documents. </sentence><sentence id="581">Over there she met a friend of her father who was already ... domesticated, so to say. </sentence><sentence id="582">He had his documents. </sentence><sentence id="583">He lived on the <span class="region">Aryan side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="584">He tried to seduce my wife, at that time not my wife yet. </sentence><sentence id="585">Tell her he would help her only if she would stay with him. </sentence><sentence id="586">Of course, she rejected the whole thing and she left him. </sentence><sentence id="587">She came <span class="building">home</span> back with false documents. </sentence><sentence id="588">Now, how do you move from a hiding place broad daylight if your <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, not too big of a <span class="populated place">town</span>, but people might know you and you didn't know who was going to denounce you? </sentence><sentence id="589">We couldn't go to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">The <span class="building">station</span> was surrounded by police and Gestapo, but at least we've had documents, so we are hire a driver with a <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> whom took us to next little <span class="populated place">town</span> which was about 15 kilometers away, at night. </sentence><sentence id="591">How this man never suspected. </sentence><sentence id="592">If he did suspect, he never said a word to us. </sentence><sentence id="593">Who we were. </sentence><sentence id="594">It was obvious, you know. </sentence><sentence id="595">We were like odd people, odd couple. </sentence><sentence id="596">Myself, little boy didn't look like our son. </sentence><sentence id="597">Too young for that. </sentence><sentence id="598">It was unusual situation so anyone with common sense would know who we are. </sentence><sentence id="599">Arriving in the darkness in a little <span class="building">railroad station</span> and we boarded a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">I was very upset, very nervous on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="601">I had documents, but, they're false documents. </sentence><sentence id="602">And after maybe two, three hours ride on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, all of a sudden <span class="spatial object">train</span> stops. </sentence><sentence id="603"><span class="dlf">Doors</span> open. </sentence><sentence id="604">German Gestapo, SS walks into each <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="605">Asks documents, everybody's documents. </sentence><sentence id="606">Well, we are not sitting together. </sentence><sentence id="607">I pretend I do not know my wife, my Lucine, I mean, my friend, in front at that time in case one is caught, maybe other escape and little boy sitting with her, just in case, her brother. </sentence><sentence id="608">And then one of the officers comes in and points out to young man. </sentence><sentence id="609">You, you, you, you. </sentence><sentence id="610">One of them was me. </sentence><sentence id="611">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="612">But there were mostly Polish people there. </sentence><sentence id="613">I was kind of confused. </sentence><sentence id="614">What's going on?Well, they were catching Poles too to send to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> you know, to send most to  3 <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="615">Get out they say. </sentence><sentence id="616">So I got out. </sentence><sentence id="617">I line up with a few other people. </sentence><sentence id="618">Maybe one of us young guys -- and go with me. </sentence><sentence id="619">I thought we shot probably. </sentence><sentence id="620">So what happened?We went to the first <span class="spatial object">car</span> and we start going to <span class="spatial object">car</span> to <span class="spatial object">car</span>, through the whole <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="621">They were liquidating all the ... tobacco, food, hams, meats, that the Polish peasants were smuggling to the <span class="populated place">city</span> to sell in the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">And we are the people that supposed to carry all the stuff to their <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">And this took about two hours, and at the end this, he gave me a big ham. </sentence><sentence id="624"><span class="populated place">Payola</span>, and back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">And so went back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and arrived at midnight in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="626">You know by now that we were accosted by a rickshaw driver. </sentence><sentence id="627">We request to go to same <span class="building">hotel</span> that my wife knew about when she got the false papers. </sentence><sentence id="628">This was the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="629">How the Gestapo didn't know about it yet I don't know, but it's the only place we knew of. </sentence><sentence id="630">The ultimate plan was either to make contact to stay in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> proper on the <span class="region">Aryan side</span>, or if not, go back to the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span> which was still big and maybe look up her uncle who lived there. </sentence><sentence id="631">Maybe he be instrumental in assisting us. </sentence><sentence id="632">So we gave him the address where to go but we see he is going to the opposite direction and we ask him, where you going? </sentence><sentence id="633">He said, oh, you know where I am going. </sentence><sentence id="634">I'm going to, you know, I'm going to <span class="building">Aleja Szucha</span>" which is known headquarters of the German Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="635">Why you take us there? </sentence><sentence id="636">You filthy Jews. </sentence><sentence id="637">I'm going to be paid for you very well. </sentence><sentence id="638">And I said, how much can you get paid for that? </sentence><sentence id="639">So we didn't deny the fact anymore. </sentence><sentence id="640">We didn't admit who we are, but it was obvious. </sentence><sentence id="641">I said, look, take whatever we have. </sentence><sentence id="642">We don't have much but whatever we have is yours. </sentence><sentence id="643">What you going to gain? </sentence><sentence id="644">They going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="645">So, he took my coat, my boots, left me with my socks, scarf, a fountain pen, little money we had, not much, took her purse, everything. </sentence><sentence id="646">Left us in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> past midnight, that if we could be caught by any patrol, you know, and killed right away. </sentence><sentence id="647">Anybody moved after midnight was a game, you know, they were shooting. </sentence><sentence id="648">They didn't ask any questions, and we found a way to this <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">Over there we made contact with some people. </sentence><sentence id="650">We see we have no way of staying outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so we contact a man who was involved in the labor groups going in and out of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="651">One of them was a friend of my father. </sentence><sentence id="652">He was from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="653">He knew my father very well. </sentence><sentence id="654">So when he recognized me he said, come in at four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="655">I will take you to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> when the group is finished working. </sentence><sentence id="656">We arrived there at four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="657">He took us all, my wife, her little brother, myself to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">Was a horrifying sign in the picture of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="659">I'm not used to it. </sentence><sentence id="660">Even in our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, the situation was not as desperate as in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="661">There was about 60,000 Jewish living in that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="662">There were many dead bodies lying in the <span class="dlf">street</span> covered with newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="663">The stench of the bodies, you know, flies, and people bypassing them like nothing happened, just macabre sight. </sentence><sentence id="664">This is what we came to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for. </sentence><sentence id="665">People dying like this. </sentence><sentence id="666">Better off dead, being shot by German. </sentence><sentence id="667">We found our way to Lucine's Uncle's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">He was very well-to-do person. </sentence><sentence id="669">He was employed  4 by American Joint Committee before the war in a very high position. </sentence><sentence id="670">Very wealthy person. </sentence><sentence id="671">They had a little baby girl so we said look, we don't have no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="672">We have no money. </sentence><sentence id="673">We have nothing. </sentence><sentence id="674">Could you help us. </sentence><sentence id="675">So he said, well, I don't know temporarily, why don't you sleep on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and Lucine -- her name was Estera at that time -- you sleep upstairs in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">He never asked us if we wanted to eat anything or not. </sentence><sentence id="677">We were hungry and we were depressed and devastated morally and broken down, sleeping at nights. </sentence><sentence id="678">Maybe 2:00, 3:00 AM I seen candlelight. </sentence><sentence id="679">I seen waking up at night her uncle and her aunt eating food, you know. </sentence><sentence id="680">They never ask us if we want to eat anything. </sentence><sentence id="681">They didn't want to share the food with us. </sentence><sentence id="682">There was not much food at that time, so they tried not to share it with us. </sentence><sentence id="683">I couldn't blame them really, you know. </sentence><sentence id="684">But we seen how can we live like this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then they got the bright idea you cannot live under one <span class="dlf">roof</span> without being married. </sentence><sentence id="686">Well, Lucine was only 16 years old and he said we have a friend who is a rabbi, a friend of your father -- meaning Lucine -- I'll try to contact. </sentence><sentence id="687">Maybe he marry you since he knew your father. </sentence><sentence id="688">Turned out he was sick at that time with typhus, and so he found another different young rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="689">Without having a ring, without having any proper clothes or suit or a dress for her, we got married. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was a young couple before us. </sentence><sentence id="691">Somehow they got us bottle of wine. </sentence><sentence id="692">We got married. </sentence><sentence id="693">We toast each other with their wine and after the wedding ceremony, which only the two people, the previous couple witnessed and also her cousin -- which survived the war too, he witnessed so till today were the only ones witnessed our wedding. </sentence><sentence id="694">Leaving the ceremony, she run into a lady who recognize her, friend of her mother, who was just out with her husband. </sentence><sentence id="695">So she said, we just got married but no rings. </sentence><sentence id="696">She took the ring off her finger. </sentence><sentence id="697">Why don't you take my ring?Maybe bring you good luck, and she give her ring. </sentence><sentence id="698">And this was our honeymoon in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">We decided to move out of her Uncle's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">We had to really. </sentence><sentence id="701">We found one little <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, cramped, with other people. </sentence><sentence id="702">They allowed us to use one <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="703">There were no <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="704">You just improvise by taking a sack, a canvas type of sack filled with straw and put some towels over it and no sheets. </sentence><sentence id="705">That was your <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and, but I had contacts. </sentence><sentence id="706">End of Tape #1  5 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1113">A: I have to regress and recall some incidents I would like to mention maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1114">When I came back from <span class="populated place">Zolochev</span> back to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> or <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>, when before I met my three other colleagues from <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1115">During the one occasion when I was I was caught by my Ukrainian colleague and he asked me -- he forces me to clean the <span class="building">pub</span>, the <span class="interior space">floor</span> etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1116">One of the days I went to work they asked some people, who's a mechanic? </sentence><sentence id="1117">This was a good profession to be in. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Without hesitation I raised my hand. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I mechanic. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I never touched anything mechanical in my life, but many people were doing the same thing, and they took me on the side and one mechanic came in, turned out to be a Jewish boy too, and ten of us we took the <span class="building">police garage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They gave us some quarter there, a <span class="spatial object">bunk bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1122">They fed us good and asked us to work on their <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">I admitted to the man, chief mechanic, that I have no blind idea about mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="1124">He said, shhh, be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1125">We'll help you what we can. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I'll tell you what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Just unscrew this portion and then oil this part and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1128">We'll tell you what to do so don't worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I'm running the show. </sentence><sentence id="1130">You do what I tell you to do. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Was very nice about it. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And so I was there for maybe a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1133">We're fed well. </sentence><sentence id="1134">We're not beaten. </sentence><sentence id="1135">The Germans usually say hello to us. </sentence><sentence id="1136">The German Police, it was not the Gestapo, this was not the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And one day during the evening, one of the German officers approached me in the <span class="building">garage</span> and took me on the side and asked me, is it true you're medical student? </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1139">He said look, I want you to be aware of it that as of tonight they're going to liquidate the <span class="building">garage</span> and they'll take you all of you away. </sentence><sentence id="1140">I don't know where, you won't stay here. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I want you to know there's a <span class="building">stable</span> on the <span class="interior space">left wing</span> of the <span class="building">building</span> there, and I will give you something to carry for me to the <span class="building">stable</span> now and I will meet you over there. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I was very puzzled with the whole thing but you do obey orders. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I went there, I followed him, went there with this big <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Then he show me behind where the horses are placed. </sentence><sentence id="1145">there's a little hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1146">You stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1147">They will never find you there and at night after they liquidate this <span class="building">garage</span>, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1148">You can stay until next day or so and somehow you have to get out of here and go to <span class="populated place">town</span> and I'm bring you something. </sentence><sentence id="1149">He went, came back maybe a few minutes later, and brought me a whole chicken. </sentence><sentence id="1150">He said, that's all I can do for you. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I can do nothing else for you. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I'm so sorry, and he left. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I don't know his name, don't know who he was. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I know he was a doctor in German Army. </sentence><sentence id="1155">He was not a Gestapo, he was not an SS man, he was not a policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1156">He was a physician, very young. </sentence><sentence id="1157">In his upper 20s maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1158">That's the only benevolent act I have encountered from Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1205">Q: Did you hear something that night while you were hiding there? </sentence><sentence id="1206"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1209">A: I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1210">And the next morning <span class="dlf">gates</span> were opening and closing and <span class="spatial object">cars</span> <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> moving out, and the whole regiment of the police left the <span class="building">compound</span> and there was no one left behind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the <span class="dlf">fence</span> I find my way back to the <span class="populated place">city</span>, to the <span class="region">ghetto area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And I approach some of the Jewish people there and they let me sleep in one the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> there, and that's next day I went out to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with the work battalion. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And I approached one the Polish people that I knew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="1213">This was on one episode. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Then when I came back <span class="building">home</span> and prior to liquidation of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> few days before, I did try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We did know that the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> the <span class="country">Ukraine</span> were shooting at me. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have caught me if not the police dog. </sentence><sentence id="1217">He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a piece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me. </sentence><sentence id="1218">I was bleeding all over. </sentence><sentence id="1219">Then I was caught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and handed over to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up. </sentence><sentence id="1220">They were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a <span class="spatial object">peitsche</span>.? </sentence><sentence id="1221">What it was is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a whip. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Actually was a hard, <span class="spatial object">metal ball</span> with points on it. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Standing behind me he was hitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And Ihave a little scar and I ... until today I am impaired vision in left eye ... was bleeding from the eye. </sentence><sentence id="1225">But I couldn't go to a doctor of course. </sentence><sentence id="1226">I will stay like this until two days later until finally, when finally the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated and I escape again. </sentence><sentence id="1227">With Lucine, my future wife and her little brother under a <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, and you know the story then that we were hiding in the <span class="building">bishop palace</span>, which I mentioned before, then went to my father's friend who hid us in a <span class="building">warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1228">Then Lucine went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to secure some papers for us. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Then she come back. </sentence><sentence id="1230">We had the papers all together but no money. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver, a candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1232">So we went to her and Lucine approached her. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Would you mind at least give us one <span class="spatial object">candelabra</span> so we can sell it, maybe find a way to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> so -- and if we don't survive, whatever else my family gave you is yours. </sentence><sentence id="1234">She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my <span class="building">home</span> everything. </sentence><sentence id="1235">Is hidden in the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and I cannot go to the <span class="interior space">attic</span> tonight because the neighbors would be very suspicious, what am I doing in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1236">But come tomorrow and I will prepare everything for you. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I will wrap it so people won't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1238">Come back tomorrow at two o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain extra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Instead of coming two o'clock, we approached the <span class="region">area</span> about noon time, 12:30. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Now,  7 we're locating ourself across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the main <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to the <span class="building">building</span> that the lady lived, and this <span class="region">area</span> was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1242">You could hide very easily there, and behind us was a little <span class="dlf">street</span> and a small <span class="interior space">apartment</span> like a <span class="interior space">street apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Actually, that my colleague from <span class="building">high school</span> lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1244">His father was a shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the <span class="building">house</span>, but then I didn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either. </sentence><sentence id="1246">So I decided to wait on the <span class="dlf">street</span> behind the <span class="building">ruin</span>, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two <span class="spatial object">police cars</span> pulling over to the <span class="dlf">curb</span> of the <span class="building">house</span> and two or four Gestapo people got out of the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and rushed up <span class="interior space">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Two people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I assume they meant us. </sentence><sentence id="1250">We didn't wait too long there. </sentence><sentence id="1251">We knew she had denounced us to the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And I just remember now talking about Judas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1253">But anyway, we didn't know what to do so we run into my friend's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1254">The parents recognized me right away, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1255">I told them what happened very briefly and shortly. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Gestapo looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="1257">What going to do? </sentence><sentence id="1258">And she very, old lady, you take your coat off. </sentence><sentence id="1259">Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel. </sentence><sentence id="1260">She gave a apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the <span class="spatial object">iron stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Said, you pretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1262">He's asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Now we'll cover him up with blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1264">There was a curtain separating a one room <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, a curtain separating the one <span class="interior space">bed area</span> from the <span class="building">work place</span> and the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and this old lady took a blanket outside, start dusting the blanket, calmly, quietly. </sentence><sentence id="1265">All of a sudden, two people approach her. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Did you see Jews here? </sentence><sentence id="1267">So she pretended. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Jews here? </sentence><sentence id="1269">There no Jews here. </sentence><sentence id="1270">They all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1271">There not nobody here. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Whose <span class="building">house</span> is that? </sentence><sentence id="1273">My <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1274">My father's working here. </sentence><sentence id="1275">My husband's client is here and my daughter is there. </sentence><sentence id="1276">She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked inside to see. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false. </sentence><sentence id="1278">They looked like they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or stupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And they left the <span class="building">house</span> and start looking for us again. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Of course, we didn't wait too much longer. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We took off. </sentence><sentence id="1282">That's when we went back to the <span class="building">warehouse</span> the same night we took that horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> type of thing to the near <span class="building">railroad station</span> near <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Well, going back to the <span class="region">ghetto area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So, we lived in one little <span class="interior space">room</span> and from there I had to go on to work detail. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered in the <span class="populated place">ghetto area</span> with a leader. </sentence><sentence id="1286">The leader was a friend of my father, and with him we're going to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="1287">We're unloading <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1288">They didn't beat us there but didn't pay us either. </sentence><sentence id="1289">Didn't feed us either. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The only pay off was I could  8 take as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work. </sentence><sentence id="1291">So I of course, I put as much coal as I could. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying the big sack of coal back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1293">It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because this was all our food depend on the coal. </sentence><sentence id="1294">I was carrying to the <span class="interior space">third story</span> with some the richer, older Jews you know. </sentence><sentence id="1295">We were buying the coal. </sentence><sentence id="1296">With the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food. </sentence><sentence id="1297">We lived on carrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas. </sentence><sentence id="1298">We were sick, stomachaches. </sentence><sentence id="1299">There was no bread. </sentence><sentence id="1300">We couldn't afford any bread. </sentence><sentence id="1301">There was nothing, nothing cooked. </sentence><sentence id="1302">There was nothing to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And on one of my trips I notice a familiar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And as I said before, you develop a certain instinct. </sentence><sentence id="1305">You just aware of your <span class="region">surroundings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Who is around there. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Who, is he a friend or an enemy? </sentence><sentence id="1308">And finally I approach him. </sentence><sentence id="1309">I start working the <span class="region">area</span> he was standing. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I said do I know you? </sentence><sentence id="1311">Aren't you from <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1312">He looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="1313">He said, who are you? </sentence><sentence id="1314">I said my name, it is Horn from <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1315">He said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Don't show any emotion. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I know you, yes, I am so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1318">His name was Lowloc Rice (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1319">I said, I know, I thought that was you. </sentence><sentence id="1320">He said, pretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long. </sentence><sentence id="1321">What are you doing here?I said I wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1322">What can I do to get out? </sentence><sentence id="1323">So he said, why don't you come tomorrow again same time and we talk in details. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I can't talk to you now right now. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I couldn't wait. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I came back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with my sack of coal. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Next day early in the morning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And he said, I can get you out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> but it cost a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1329">I said, I don't have no money but, you know what before I left the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, my father show me a spot in his <span class="building">shop</span> that he buried a case. </sentence><sentence id="1330">It's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of our friends who was a jeweler. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live the rest of your life on it. </sentence><sentence id="1332">| remember that spot. </sentence><sentence id="1333">That's the only thing I know. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I hope it's still there, but I cannot give guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1335">But I know this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1336">If you were willing to talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find, half is theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1337">I need only a little bit to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1338">You can take more than half. </sentence><sentence id="1339">I will leave it up to you, how much you want. </sentence><sentence id="1340">How much you leave to us. </sentence><sentence id="1341">He said, let me talk to my people. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I said, who are your people? </sentence><sentence id="1343">Well, I can tell you that that's <span class="building">Polish Underground</span>, <span class="building">Armia Krajowa</span>, or <span class="building">Home Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1344">They need money to buy ammunition, arms, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1345">I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is complicated, but if they will, I'll let you know. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I will be here in a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="1347">But I don't know what day, but I'll find you. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So I was coming to <span class="building">work</span> every day with the hope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Maybe is something work out. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Otherwise, I see the doom. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1352">He said, I talk to my people. </sentence><sentence id="1353">They went for it, and on such and such a day you lead off. </sentence><sentence id="1354">Your leader of your group is part of us. </sentence><sentence id="1355">He part of us, our group too. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He knows all about it. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So you will be snatched too. </sentence><sentence id="1358">Make sure your wife goes to <span class="building">work</span>  9 too and her little brother too. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Children were going to work too. </sentence><sentence id="1360">No one question anything. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of coal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the <span class="building">Polish Underground</span> waiting with a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and then a <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1362">We change <span class="spatial object">streetcars</span> to different <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> and people were changing to our guards. </sentence><sentence id="1363">Our guards were changing. </sentence><sentence id="1364">They all armed in case they caught us there would be a fight. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And we arrived to a <span class="building">house</span>, to an <span class="building">apartment house</span> which one of the -- not <span class="building">headquarters</span> but one the <span class="interior space">apartments</span> were the Polish Home Army was meeting was meeting there. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I was surprised. </sentence><sentence id="1367">We found maybe 10 or 12 Jewish people there, hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1368">I found out that he is helping lot of Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1369">I looked at it and I met this man. </sentence><sentence id="1370">I asked him why do you do that. </sentence><sentence id="1371">The first man I seen so definitely show the effort and the risk to help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1373">You like the Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1374">He said, no I don't. </sentence><sentence id="1375">So why do you do that? </sentence><sentence id="1376">Well, I show you. </sentence><sentence id="1377">He took me another <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Now listen to it. </sentence><sentence id="1379">And I listened. </sentence><sentence id="1380">There were noises over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, people talking Yiddish, arguing and fighting with each other. </sentence><sentence id="1381">He said, what kind of people are you? </sentence><sentence id="1382">I'm risking my life and here they start I fighting about, they fighting about stupid things and the neighbors they hear those things. </sentence><sentence id="1383">They denounce it and we're all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I never see people in danger who do this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I don't respect your people. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I have no answer to it. </sentence><sentence id="1387">What can I say. </sentence><sentence id="1388">They're old orthodox people. </sentence><sentence id="1389">For some reason they felt they should continue their orthodoxy, their sacred needs. </sentence><sentence id="1390">They want kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="1391">You know, where you going to get kosher food there? </sentence><sentence id="1392">One of the men died, older man died, but he was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="1393">What the <span class="building">Home Army</span> did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a <span class="spatial object">canvas sack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1394">That's how the Jews are buried you know. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Not in the <span class="spatial object">coffins</span>, and they threw him over the <span class="dlf">wall</span> in the <span class="building">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1396">They didn't bury him there and but left him there in the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I think this was more than anybody could expect. </sentence><sentence id="1398">But this was just one the examples what those people did for us. </sentence><sentence id="1399">And, they described the whole plan what we're going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1400">First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man and they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad uniform, with documents employed by railroads in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And he said, you going to go with a group of few people. </sentence><sentence id="1402">One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes Deutch is a German who lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> for generations, but he still did not lose his German identity. </sentence><sentence id="1403">He could be Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And this was, one was by your German. </sentence><sentence id="1405">He was just an excuse to get all the <span class="country">country</span> German Army. </sentence><sentence id="1406">He knew where they are and he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be always humiliated by the Poles and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1407">So it's special right and privileges. </sentence><sentence id="1408">He was our protector on the trip on the <span class="dlf">rail</span> to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> with guarded by two Polish Underground people, armed all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1409">We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the location used to be a <span class="building">shack</span> was a <span class="dlf">street</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="1410">The <span class="building">shack</span> was raised. </sentence><sentence id="1411">To explain a little  0 bit yet more about the situation, <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> was at site where the Jewish POWs from the Polish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the dirty work for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1412">They were digging in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1413">They are leveling the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1414">They were removing the <span class="dlf">door-frames</span>, the <span class="dlf">window-frames</span>, the <span class="dlf">door</span>, the hinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds, everything they could. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and they leveled that <span class="building">hut</span>, the little <span class="building">shack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1416">There was nothing ... but I seen the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I knew the spot right way. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And I said, I'm going to stand up on that spot. </sentence><sentence id="1419">That's where it is. </sentence><sentence id="1420">But he said, that's a <span class="dlf">street</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="1421">He said, well, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1422">We'll come back tomorrow and we left. </sentence><sentence id="1423">He took me to one of the <span class="building">people home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">I stay overnight. </sentence><sentence id="1425">They fed me. </sentence><sentence id="1426">They treated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same location. </sentence><sentence id="1427">What do I see?The whole <span class="dlf">street</span> is blocked off, detour. </sentence><sentence id="1428">The signs of detour. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Broad daylight. </sentence><sentence id="1430">A <span class="building">tent</span> is erected middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and the a <span class="spatial object">sign</span>, and A big roll of cable standing next to the <span class="building">tent</span>, the <span class="building">German Post Office</span> and <span class="spatial object">telegraph</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And people, helmets and overcoats are digging in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> right where this thing is, the understand was when they find the case that I described. </sentence><sentence id="1432">They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found it. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Now, I was hiding across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and behind a <span class="dlf">door</span> there was a little <span class="dlf">window</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1434">There were people passing. </sentence><sentence id="1435">It was a big <span class="building">apartment house</span> and I was standing there, and looking through a little <span class="dlf">window</span> there and watching if they lit the torch. </sentence><sentence id="1436">When this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the case and they won't need me no more. </sentence><sentence id="1437">They will take me away and we'll go back <span class="building">home</span> and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Don't forget, this my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this would be the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="1440">But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it wouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="1441">If this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Germans don't enter this <span class="region">area</span> anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1443">They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe took about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them reaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And I was sweating and I thought that was a sign. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I was coming out right into the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I don't know what to say, but at least I knew this was true. </sentence><sentence id="1447">They knew that I didn't lie to them. </sentence><sentence id="1448">But where's the gold? </sentence><sentence id="1449">Where's all the goodies? </sentence><sentence id="1450">We found out later on that the Jewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty case there and closed it up. </sentence><sentence id="1451">They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day, understand, people are selling watches in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> of the POWs. </sentence><sentence id="1452">Watches and gold they were selling everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were going back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because they did not receive what they are supposed to get. </sentence><sentence id="1454">On the way back <span class="building">home</span> on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> we talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We had one <span class="interior space">compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1456">There was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1457">We cannot pay you people. </sentence><sentence id="1458">I want you to understanding that I didn't lie  1 to you about it. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Yes, we know that. </sentence><sentence id="1460">You going to send me back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1461">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1463">What would you do in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1464">You would perish in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Maybe you can help us here on this side. </sentence><sentence id="1466">You can work for your upkeep. </sentence><sentence id="1467">We'll discuss the detail and come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So we turn back to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And you know the rest of the story. </sentence><sentence id="1470">That important fact I omitted that we got married in <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and my wife, with the help of the <span class="building">Polish Underground</span> got us a little <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, one little <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I was hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I did go to a hiding place in the <span class="interior space">washroom</span>, boarding up the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of the <span class="interior space">washroom</span> and creating a hiding <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1473">When you lifted the boards of the <span class="dlf">wall</span> was a secret <span class="dlf">door</span> that you open up, and behind the <span class="dlf">door</span> was a little hiding place accommodating maybe eight or nine people. </sentence><sentence id="1474">I built a little <span class="spatial object">bed</span> so we could lie there and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Now this part of the <span class="building">building</span> was totally destroyed during the bombing of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, so there was a way we could have run away from this hiding place any case of a danger, if someone entered the front of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, with a signal which was dissident in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1476">In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> twice, and we would know to run. </sentence><sentence id="1477">We did have an emergency address where to go, another hiding place through the <span class="building">Home Army</span>, hiding Jews in case of different location. </sentence><sentence id="1478">In case of emergency we could find a spot there until situation would clear up. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was bringing too much food in her little <span class="spatial object">basket</span> and he thought two women living in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police. </sentence><sentence id="1480">One day when she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1481">She was selling women's nets on the <span class="building">market</span>, <span class="building">flea market</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Nobody knew she was Jewish, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1483">She had good looks as an Aryan person. </sentence><sentence id="1484">She seen policeman at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1485">She didn't want to go in so she went to a <span class="building">store</span> in the same <span class="building">building</span>, <span class="building">grocery store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1486">First thing she did was took the key out of her <span class="spatial object">purse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1487">She drop the key in a sack of beans and while doing this the policeman entered the <span class="building">store</span> and arrested her. </sentence><sentence id="1488">They when through her <span class="spatial object">purse</span> and ask her where her key. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Oh, I guess I lost it. </sentence><sentence id="1490">They look on the <span class="dlf">street</span> everywhere, they couldn't find it. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Which is your <span class="interior space">apartment</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1492">What do you want?What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="1493">We understand you are hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1494">You are accused by the janitor that you bring too much food for two people there. </sentence><sentence id="1495">We want to see your <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1496">This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>, and on <span class="dlf">stairway</span> we could hear the <span class="dlf">steps</span> of the boots and the noise and the argumentation. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And then my wife said, there is nobody there unless my aunt is. </sentence><sentence id="1498">She working too. </sentence><sentence id="1499">She is not <span class="building">home</span> yet but let me knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1500">She knocked twice which was danger signal. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And we also had some rabbits in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the rabbits walking around. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And they could hear some noise in there. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Is there somebody in there? </sentence><sentence id="1504">Well, maybe the rabbits. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So they broke down the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1506">They look over. </sentence><sentence id="1507">They went to the <span class="interior space">washroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1508">They did not discover our hiding place at all, although we are not there no more. </sentence><sentence id="1509">They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1510">And they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and she stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1511"> 2 She discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they suggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And she went to the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Without any difficulty she got a copy of ID and she left, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1515">During one of the trips on the <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> they stole her purse again. </sentence><sentence id="1516">She lost the documents again. </sentence><sentence id="1517">Same history repeat itself. </sentence><sentence id="1518">She went back there and got ID, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1519">I had to occasionally had to run from place to place and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with them to the main <span class="building">office</span> there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed away, young man was two years younger than I really was. </sentence><sentence id="1520">His name was Wojick (ph), Felix Wojick. </sentence><sentence id="1521">So I assumed his identity. </sentence><sentence id="1522">So this birth certificate, I entered the main <span class="building">office</span> and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1523">No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents, and they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1524">But I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not difficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and know who we are. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the <span class="region">danger spot</span>, but I tried to avoid situation like this. </sentence><sentence id="1526">So Lucine was working for the <span class="building">Polish Underground</span> actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1527">They were taught how to make woman's hair nets. </sentence><sentence id="1528">It was a fashionable thing at that time to do. </sentence><sentence id="1529">They were taking the <span class="spatial object">car</span> inner-tubes or <span class="spatial object">truck inner-tubes</span> and cutting into small strips, very narrow strips. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Then they could buy white silk and then they are dying the silk different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue. </sentence><sentence id="1532">So making any net color you desire with the orders they receive. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So I was taught by the group how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk. </sentence><sentence id="1534">So I was making the elastic, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1535">The other group people were making the <span class="spatial object">nets</span> themself by hand of course. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very professionally. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also Jewish person, good looks. </sentence><sentence id="1538">They were spreading all over the <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="building">market places</span> and <span class="building">flea markets</span> etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was like a prisoner in my own <span class="building">house</span> which I readily assumed and took. </sentence><sentence id="1539">I was taught how to do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too and do it on the side and <span class="building">Lucine</span> can sell for you too. </sentence><sentence id="1540">So be it. </sentence><sentence id="1541">We did. </sentence><sentence id="1542">We started to accumulated a little money. </sentence><sentence id="1543">We felt a little more comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1544">We were not that poor no more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1884">Q: Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after. </sentence><sentence id="1885">What was it like hiding with him in that little <span class="interior space">cubicle</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1888">A: It was very pathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1889">He was little boy. </sentence><sentence id="1890">He was like a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1891">It was hard for him to understand why he was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1892">He knew he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1893">He knew he could not show  3 his face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants down, they know who he is. </sentence><sentence id="1894">So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1895">He was pale. </sentence><sentence id="1896">He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine. </sentence><sentence id="1897">He couldn't play. </sentence><sentence id="1898">I tried to be very near him, put arms around him. </sentence><sentence id="1899">He miss his parents. </sentence><sentence id="1900">He was at the age he understood. </sentence><sentence id="1901">He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1902">There were times that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1903">He was still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The political situation just forced the people to grow up very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1905">So he was aware of what really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you know. </sentence><sentence id="1906">I couldn't replace his father. </sentence><sentence id="1907">I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried to do best I could. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I try to be the disciplinarian. </sentence><sentence id="1909">Sometimes he want to do certain things he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And he tell, me you're not my father. </sentence><sentence id="1911">I said, I know. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I don't pretend to father. </sentence><sentence id="1913">But you cannot do it because all of us would be in danger, you including. </sentence><sentence id="1914">So it was a very tragic thing to see him going through all this thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1915"> I did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen, when we run away from the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to emergency hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1916">That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who turned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="1917">She knew she was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1918">She said, what you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1919">She was afraid to tell anything, because we didn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Is she pro Gestapo or is she going to tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all. </sentence><sentence id="1921">But she finally told her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you know. </sentence><sentence id="1922">But you know I remember your parents. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I can help you maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1924">So she, Lucine, told her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have <span class="interior space">apartment</span> anymore. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1925">We stay only a few days. </sentence><sentence id="1926">We didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Next we have brothers with us and she said, you know, what this was is this <span class="building">Hotel Polski</span>, <span class="building">Polish hotel</span>, that the Germans with a lot of money taking people and they go to <span class="region">southern France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1928">The letters arrive from those people who went on <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to <span class="region">southern France</span>, writing back to their relatives in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1929">Right at the <span class="env feature">sea</span>, sunning ourself. </sentence><sentence id="1930">Life is different. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1931">We waiting for visas to go to <span class="region">South America</span> to <span class="region">North America</span>, to the <span class="country">United States</span> and I hope you can join us. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters, except that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick. </sentence><sentence id="1933">When we wanted to register they said, well, the next <span class="spatial object">transport</span> not going to a week later, but this time it was totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1934">So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1935">We want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1936">She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for nothing, but you have to come up with money. </sentence><sentence id="1937">So we said we have no money. </sentence><sentence id="1938">So she promised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through certain stages of hiding and before reaching that <span class="building">hotel</span> because you went in there was only Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1939">You didn't  4 know if Gestapo waiting outside or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of this <span class="building">hotel</span> and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very nice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, <span class="region">southern France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1940">We did receive one postcard from a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> someplace that everything fine from him. </sentence><sentence id="1941">It was his writing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1942"> But did he really write what he meant? </sentence><sentence id="1943">Was he forced to write it? </sentence><sentence id="1944">We don't know, but this was the last thing we ever heard. </sentence><sentence id="1945">The final thing what we heard actually after of the war, that the whole <span class="spatial object">train</span> went to <span class="region">Northern Germany</span> near <span class="populated place">Hannover</span> someplace to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and they were all eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="1946">So, the whole thing was a <span class="dlf">stage</span>, a plot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the safety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later get out. </sentence><sentence id="1947">So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to <span class="region">Southern France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1948">Unfortunately, we couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1949">We had no money, not that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst because we didn't hear nothing for months to come. </sentence><sentence id="1951">We suspected he probably perished, but for sure we didn't know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1952">Life was going on and Lucine was selling her hair nets. </sentence><sentence id="1953">I making the <span class="spatial object">hair net</span> and off and on we lost our hiding place due to some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1954">So we jumped from one place to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews, and they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was suspected of being not in order they run to us. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And one day one of her schooling girlfriends notify Lucine that her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> is no good and her husband is going to go to Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1956">So we took him to our <span class="building">house</span>, our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1957">He slept to with us, one <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, all three of us. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And two days later he left us and went to <span class="building">Polish Underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I understand he perished there and his wife perished too. </sentence><sentence id="1960">So we one day we looking again for another <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1961">This was a constant situation every few months we looking for another <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because people are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might suspect it and you can't take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1962">They might call the police or so. </sentence><sentence id="1963">One day she met a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet, and she knew that the lady recognize her already. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And they hug and kiss and so and she was a widow. </sentence><sentence id="1965">They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from <span class="building">store</span> to <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1966">She had one room <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, little <span class="interior space">kitchenette</span>, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Lucine told her we're without <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1968">She said, why you don't come to me? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1969"> She said yea, but, you know who we are? </sentence><sentence id="1970">Oh, yes, I know who you are. </sentence><sentence id="1971">You know what we doing? </sentence><sentence id="1972">Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="1973">We have little money. </sentence><sentence id="1974">What will this cost us? </sentence><sentence id="1975">Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100 Zlotys per month, and I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys. </sentence><sentence id="1977">I'm not  5 sure exactly the amount. </sentence><sentence id="1978">That's what she requested. </sentence><sentence id="1979">She was very happy to get that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="1980">She was struggling economically. </sentence><sentence id="1981">So we moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Move in, we didn't have nothing to move in with. </sentence><sentence id="1983">A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my little <span class="building">factory</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="1984">I was making those little <span class="spatial object">hair nets</span>, producing. </sentence><sentence id="1985">Lucine was selling it. </sentence><sentence id="1986">Now, we have to think about safety. </sentence><sentence id="1987">I don't flush the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> because both ladies, Lucine and this <span class="building">house-lady</span>, were working so I couldn't walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1988">I couldn't flush the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1989">I waiting until they came back <span class="building">home</span> not to create suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="1990"><span class="interior space">Floors</span> were wooden. </sentence><sentence id="1991">You afraid to put your weight down because the <span class="interior space">floors</span> were squeaking. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1992">Be very, very, careful. </sentence><sentence id="1993">I used to walk on the <span class="spatial object">board</span> next to the <span class="dlf">wall</span> where the <span class="interior space">floor</span> was more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without creating a noise. </sentence><sentence id="1994">Then this was in the corner of the <span class="interior space">room</span>, there was a <span class="spatial object">ceramic heater</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1995">I don't if you're familiar with European heating system. </sentence><sentence id="1996">It's made out of ceramic tiles, squares up to the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span> almost, and connected to the <span class="dlf">chimney</span>, and you were heating with coal there. </sentence><sentence id="1997">There was a little <span class="dlf">door</span>, <span class="dlf">metal door</span> you put your wood or coal this was. </sentence><sentence id="1998">Well, I decided to do to hollow out that <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1999">I disassemble the whole <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2000">Lucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag. </sentence><sentence id="2001">I use a fork and a knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles. </sentence><sentence id="2002">Don't forget this was old <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, and from the <span class="dlf">base</span> on I rebuild the whole <span class="spatial object">stove</span> using clay and water. </sentence><sentence id="2003">And I remove the top, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a <span class="spatial object">wooden planking</span> and put the tile on top of the <span class="spatial object">wooden planking</span> so I would get cover. </sentence><sentence id="2004">But you have to heat it so what are you going to do. </sentence><sentence id="2005">So we bought a little iron <span class="spatial object">stove</span> with a pipe. </sentence><sentence id="2006">The <span class="dlf">pipe</span> was going right in the middle of the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> into the <span class="dlf">chimney</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2007">There was a little <span class="spatial object">stool</span> and a <span class="spatial object">table</span> next to the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> in case of emergency. </sentence><sentence id="2008">I could step on the <span class="spatial object">stool</span> on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> inside the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2009">I was sitting like on horseback on the <span class="dlf">pipe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2010">Only thing I forgot not being professional, what am I going to do if the <span class="dlf">pipe</span> is going to be hot because the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> is being used for cooking? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2011"> Didn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this <span class="spatial object">contraption</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2012">I was not a scientist. </sentence><sentence id="2013">I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2014">But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it. </sentence><sentence id="2015">All of a sudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the <span class="populated place">village</span> near <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, who one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, I had only maybe a minute time to get into the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2016">I got in the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2017">He came in. </sentence><sentence id="2018">They tried to get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2019">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="2020">I stay here overnight. </sentence><sentence id="2021">I go <span class="building">home</span> tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2022">So I stayed in the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> all night. </sentence><sentence id="2023">When he left following morning, I was totally unconscious, overcome by fumes. </sentence><sentence id="2024">They couldn't call a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2025">They couldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2026">They were two women, one old lady. </sentence><sentence id="2027">Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="2028">I was a heavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I got out of that <span class="spatial object">stove</span> and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration, springing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2029">This was my first experience in hiding place like this. </sentence><sentence id="2030">The other experience, I had,  6 another cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog. </sentence><sentence id="2031">I had no time to get to the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2032">There was a <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span> against the <span class="dlf">wall</span> so I hid in <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span> behind coats and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2033">All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming toward the <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span> and barking and barking and barking. </sentence><sentence id="2034">Didn't want to leave, and this cousin of this <span class="building">house-lady</span> said, what are you barking? </sentence><sentence id="2035">What do you see in that <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2036">Oh, I probably have a little ham there. </sentence><sentence id="2037">I'm peddling <span class="spatial object">ham</span>, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2038">He probably want this. </sentence><sentence id="2039">So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and he ate it and stopped barking. </sentence><sentence id="2040">And there were few episodes like this where I was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2041">But each time I escape without any problems. </sentence><sentence id="2042">Until one day our benefactor from the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the <span class="building">Polish Underground</span> is staging an uprising. </sentence><sentence id="2043">In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're located next to the former <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2044">We see the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> burning. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2045"> We see people dancing and is laughing outside the <span class="dlf">ghetto walls</span> saying the Jewish bed bugs are frying. </sentence><sentence id="2046">Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2047">I didn't hear it myself. </sentence><sentence id="2048">I just heard the noise. </sentence><sentence id="2049">I heard the explosions in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2050">This was the Jewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries. </sentence><sentence id="2051">Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then the fire and eventually of course, after almost what? </sentence><sentence id="2052">Less than a month, the whole <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the <span class="region">area</span> and there was no more <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2053">Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food because there is going to be uprising <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> proper. </sentence><sentence id="2054">We don't be able to get anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="2055">If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the money will be worth nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2056">Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan from us. </sentence><sentence id="2057">He needed money to transport some Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2058">He had no money to save them. </sentence><sentence id="2059">So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep of those people. </sentence><sentence id="2060">We gave him the money. </sentence><sentence id="2061">He returned the money to us eventually. </sentence><sentence id="2062">So Lucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the <span class="building">jeweler stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2063">You couldn't buy nothing else but <span class="spatial object">wedding rings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2064">We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 <span class="spatial object">rings</span> which we could not get rid of afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="2065">After the war they are worth practically nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2066">The uprising started. </sentence><sentence id="2067">Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our group. </sentence><sentence id="2068">We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight. </sentence><sentence id="2069">I said, your fight is my fight. </sentence><sentence id="2070">You saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="2071">Whatever you want me to do, I will do. </sentence><sentence id="2072">We need somebody to attack the <span class="building">German warehouses</span> to steal the provisions, food for our soldiers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2073">It's under fire. </sentence><sentence id="2074">And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a group of five, six people from the Home Army ,<span class="interior space">Underground</span> don't forget the <span class="interior space">basements</span> were connected to each <span class="building">house</span> next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="2075">They cut through the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of each <span class="building">house</span> so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but underground we moving the whole <span class="populated place">underground city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2076">We moving from one end of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to the other end underground. </sentence><sentence id="2077">And that's how we knew which was the <span class="dlf">exit</span> where to go, where the <span class="building">warehouses</span> were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we could of course, we didn't have no <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2078">All on our backs, you know, and pockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could. </sentence><sentence id="2079"> 7 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2080"> We disappear in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2081">The German looking for us and couldn't find us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2082">We disappear. </sentence><sentence id="2083">Then that's how we brought the

to. </sentence><sentence id="2323">So I told him, <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2324">I told him the story. </sentence><sentence id="2325">I told him all these things which was true. </sentence><sentence id="2326">My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about it, one thing, I brag my language. </sentence><sentence id="2327">I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite. </sentence><sentence id="2328">Is perfect, really perfect, literately Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2329">They couldn't understand it because Jews don't speak that kind of Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2330">None of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2331">So, but he never said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2332">He was very cordial. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a good cook, but he done what he could. </sentence><sentence id="2334">By being fellow from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and so on we have something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him. </sentence><sentence id="2335">He didn't want to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And slowly I was recovering. </sentence><sentence id="2337">Then I got the idea how could I repay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And I thought since the <span class="building">schools</span> were illegal and <span class="building">schools</span> closed I would organize a secret <span class="building">Polish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And I suspected that mayor of the <span class="populated place">village</span> was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly who he was. </sentence><sentence id="2340">He was more than just the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And one day I approached him. </sentence><sentence id="2342">I said, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="2343">I feel strong enough. </sentence><sentence id="2344">I like to teach the children Polish language to read. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Little math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Let them be aware of what was going on now. </sentence><sentence id="2347">But I have no books. </sentence><sentence id="2348">How we going to get books? </sentence><sentence id="2349">The <span class="region">area</span> we located was far away from our normal <span class="region">area</span> where we used to live you know. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I didn't know anyone there. </sentence><sentence id="2351">0 he said, "well, I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2352">I'll give you a name. </sentence><sentence id="2353">You can go to next <span class="populated place">village</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2354">As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2355">Maybe I take you with me, in the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and then I don't know want to go with you, to this place, to that person. </sentence><sentence id="2356">Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need. </sentence><sentence id="2357">But I said I don't have money either -- "don't worry about that, just don't worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="2358">Just tell him what need." </sentence><sentence id="2359">I will straighten it out. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And I met this person. </sentence><sentence id="2361">He looked at me suspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents. </sentence><sentence id="2362">Asked I was from <span class="building">Home Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2363">I said, yes, I was wounded during the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="2364">So he had no reason to doubt me, which was true. </sentence><sentence id="2365">I didn't say who I was. </sentence><sentence id="2366">He gave me about ten difference books. </sentence><sentence id="2367">Polish readings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers. </sentence><sentence id="2368">Here I am, educational director. </sentence><sentence id="2369">I'm organizing a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2370">I took the kids together in one <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2371">I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about it because if the German find out that we have a secret <span class="building">school</span>, they are going to burn the <span class="populated place">village</span> and we have to have a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2372">So we taught the kids that each day, one of the kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard outside on the top, on the <span class="interior space">roof</span> of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2373">Our <span class="populated place">village</span> was top of the <span class="dlf">hill</span> so you can see the <span class="dlf">road</span> down there in the next <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2374">If the Germans coming to the <span class="populated place">village</span>, they had to come to this  <span class="dlf">3 road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2375">So if you watch this <span class="dlf">road</span>, you will find out who was coming to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2376">Then you can take proper precautions. </sentence><sentence id="2377">We told the kids if anything suspicious, right away they dispenses each one runs to his own <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2378">Each one runs, takes the book with him right away, there not be a trace left of any educational type material on the <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2379">And we conduct <span class="building">school</span> very nicely with no problem, with no difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="2380">Kids were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2381">They obey. </sentence><sentence id="2382">And one day during the classes, all of a sudden a <span class="dlf">door</span> opens up and two men with hats, long gray leather coats, boots, typical Gestapo detectives walk in. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And right away ask me, "Are you Mr. Wojick?" </sentence><sentence id="2384">Well, I don't have to tell you how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="2385">I knew this was it, someone denounces me. </sentence><sentence id="2386">You come with us. </sentence><sentence id="2387">I was ready to faint. </sentence><sentence id="2388">Try to regain my composure. </sentence><sentence id="2389">Tried to ask him what it's all about. </sentence><sentence id="2390">They said "you go with us." </sentence><sentence id="2391">I walked out into the <span class="interior space">hallway</span>, and they stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2392">They start shaking my hand. </sentence><sentence id="2393">We came in on orders of the Polish Government Exile who found out that someone is organizing a secret Polish education for the children, and we just want to thank you and congratulate you. </sentence><sentence id="2394">We want to assure you that the end of the problem is soon. </sentence><sentence id="2395">The war is almost at the end. </sentence><sentence id="2396">The Germans are losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="2397">There was no news. </sentence><sentence id="2398">We don't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2399">The Russian Army is advancing and they should be here within weeks probably, and with this they left. </sentence><sentence id="2400">Until today I don't know what happened to that boy on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> of the <span class="building">house</span>, that he didn't detect the two men walking in there. </sentence><sentence id="2401">Could be Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2402">Anyway, I was continuing teaching then all of a sudden we heard rumblings from the <span class="region">front</span> nearby, the noise of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2403">The explosions and the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> was getting louder, louder every day and of course, our hope was building up each minute. </sentence><sentence id="2404">But the awareness that we could lose our lives, the end, the last hour of life was still with me. </sentence><sentence id="2405">And I decided one day one of the sons of the neighbor came in. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Was a member of the <span class="building">Polish Underground</span> but a different underground what they used to call the N.S.Z.deg which a Polish nationalist alliance group, together with Polish Hitlerites, they just found in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> a <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, a woman, two children, hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2407">So they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="2408">He came to our <span class="building">house</span> to tell us about it. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Thought we would rejoice it, and we had, I had to hear that. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And he told us that he's leaving, go <span class="region">west</span> with the Germans because the Russians are coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2411">If they catch him he will be sent to <span class="region">Siberia</span> because his group was cooperating with the Germans, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And he left. </sentence><sentence id="2413">I talked to the peasants, my friends now. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I said, "You know, I would like to meet the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2415">Said, please, please don't, and Mr.Wojick don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="2416">They won't come here anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2417">Don't do that it's dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2418">You don't want to go in the <span class="dlf">field</span> of action, but I had to go there. </sentence><sentence id="2419">So I was crawling out the <span class="populated place">village</span> on all my fours. </sentence><sentence id="2420">There was a little <span class="env feature">forest</span> next the  4 <span class="populated place">village</span> and I could see the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> for maybe, like a hundred feet away, only the <span class="spatial object">Russian tanks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2421">I recognize the star on the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> and I recognize their faces because their head was up out the <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, you know, looking with field glasses where they are or something, and I start getting up, to try to greet them and they start shooting at me. </sentence><sentence id="2422">The <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, thank Gods, the they didn't hit me, didn't get near me. </sentence><sentence id="2423">You know, I crawled right back, right back to the <span class="populated place">village</span> scared stiff. </sentence><sentence id="2424">Before I knew it the Russian entered the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2425">They asked for the mayor and asked how many people there was in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2426">And I was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2427">They asked me who I was. </sentence><sentence id="2428">I speak fluent Russian so I said, "I'm the teacher here." </sentence><sentence id="2429">Then the Russian tell him I'm also a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2430">He said, "A Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2431">You're lying, there are no Jews here. </sentence><sentence id="2432">You must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2433">How come you speak Russian? </sentence><sentence id="2434">Only a spy speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And the Jews, there are no Jews left. </sentence><sentence id="2436">They are all killed." </sentence><sentence id="2437">I said, "That's not true. </sentence><sentence id="2438">Myself and my wife, we escaped and we hiding under false names." " </sentence><sentence id="2439">False names, you must be a spy," and I said, "No, I'm telling you lam Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2440">And he said, wait and minute, and he called another officer. </sentence><sentence id="2441">His name was Lev. </sentence><sentence id="2442">I remember like today. </sentence><sentence id="2443">It was a typical Jewish first name in <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Lev, come over here. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Take a load of this. </sentence><sentence id="2446">This guy telling me he is a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2447">Now, you Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2448">You find out. </sentence><sentence id="2449">He comes to me and about 45-year-old man. </sentence><sentence id="2450">He said, I am from <span class="populated place">Leningrad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2451">I'm a plumber by profession. </sentence><sentence id="2452">I'm officer in the <span class="populated place">Russian Tank Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2453">"Now, you tell me you're Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="2454">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="2455">So he start talking me Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2456">I do not understand Yiddish. " </sentence><sentence id="2457">You tell me you're Jewish and you don't understand Yiddish." " </sentence><sentence id="2458">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2459">Because my family always spoke Polish to me. </sentence><sentence id="2460">My parents spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2461">I understand Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2462">I can tell you what you say. </sentence><sentence id="2463">But I can not talk. </sentence><sentence id="2464">"There's no way. </sentence><sentence id="2465">No Jew--If you Jewish, you speak Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="2466">I said, "Believe me. </sentence><sentence id="2467">I am a Jew but I do not speak Yiddish." " </sentence><sentence id="2468">No, you cannot be a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2469">He might be right. </sentence><sentence id="2470">You must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2471">How come you speak Russian?" </sentence><sentence id="2472">So, I told him my story. </sentence><sentence id="2473">I was in <span class="building">Lvov medical school</span>, I learn Russian from some colleagues that spoke Russian and I told him and he said that's all baloney, I don't believe one word you say, you must be a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Then .I remember a prayer in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="2475">At that time rabbi that come to my <span class="building">home</span> teach me a few things. </sentence><sentence id="2476">I forgot most of it but I remember one prayer. </sentence><sentence id="2477">I said, wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="2478">You know how to pray?

I didn't have to be reminded about it. </sentence><sentence id="2607">After the war things were worse. </sentence><sentence id="2608">Instead of telling me I'm so happy you survived. </sentence><sentence id="2609">Did anyone else survive? </sentence><sentence id="2610">Can we do anything for you?Can we help you, books whatever? </sentence><sentence id="2611">They tell me another

were architecture, art and so on and we organize a student group in this <span class="populated place">town</span> who performed music, dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that came back from

understood this. </sentence><sentence id="2622">So there was a kind of a chaos on the <span class="dlf">border</span> but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so. </sentence><sentence id="2623">Everybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group everybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here. </sentence><sentence id="2624">We shouldn't stay here. </sentence><sentence id="2625">So we thought maybe we should leave <span class="country">Poland</span> and go someplace <span

know he went to <span class="building">jail</span>, maybe two years in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2637">In the meantime, I was without any money and so on, so I decided to sell my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2638">It was a beautiful <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2639">But I didn't have nothing to live on. </sentence><sentence id="2640">No suits, no dress for my wife, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2641">So I approached somebody who was an attorney. </sentence><sentence

class="building">building</span> at least. </sentence><sentence id="2650">I said, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2651">I sold it for $1,000. </sentence><sentence id="2652">The attorney took $400 so I was left with $400 American dollar which was a fortune. </sentence><sentence id="2653">I buy a new suit. </sentence><sentence id="2654">The only picture I have right now is in the <span class="building">museum</span> is with Lucine when we both were dressed. </sentence><sentence id="2655">She bought a new hat. </sentence><sentence id="2656">I bought a suit and shoes and we are in the <span class="dlf">park</span>, and our kids look at the picture, Dad, you don't look like you just survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="2657">You look like you came from a <span

</sentence><sentence id="2660">We cannot bring back what we lost. </sentence><sentence id="2661">We can live with the past, we can live with our memories. </sentence><sentence id="2662">We can start from scratch and build our <span class="building">home</span> again from the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2663">So that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2664">I bought her a delayed wedding present. </sentence><sentence id="2665">I bought her a ring, small ring and a watch, gold watch with the money and one day the whole group, with the help of <span class="populated

the <span class="building">Palestinian underground agency</span> which is helping the Jews escape from <span class="country">Soviet Russia</span> coming to <span class="country">Poland</span> want to

id="2669">With their assistance we crossed the <span class="dlf">border</span> one cold night in November, 1946. </sentence><sentence id="2670">The only thing I took we me is my student papers, my books and so on in case I ever go back to <span class="building">school</span> and to save my papers. </sentence><sentence id="2671">And on their advice they took us to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2672">We met a lot of Jewish students already, Americans, first time  8 I seen Americans, life full of music and laughter. </sentence><sentence id="2673">I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2674">I didn't know how to behave. </sentence><sentence id="2675">I was afraid of this thing. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I thought it was sacrilegious; to laugh and to smile and go to <span class="building">night clubs</span>, <span class="building">coffee houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2677">I couldn't cope with it. </sentence><sentence id="2678">I wasn't ready for it you know. </sentence><sentence id="2679">But we stayed together the whole group for about 2 year and one when his own way. </sentence><sentence id="2680">They graduated -- one architecture, one electrical engineer, few medical students. </sentence><sentence id="2681">One boy couldn't cope with the situation. </sentence><sentence

way. </sentence><sentence id="2685">With the help of the American Joint Committee we getting a stipend to pay for our tuition. </sentence><sentence id="2686">To my amazement when they accepted me to <span class="building">medical school</span> they accept all the papers translated by the Jewish Committee in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> found out I need my <span

class="building">high school</span> diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2691">For whatever strange reason, I had 6 years of Latin and a degree of Latin was a dash, like I never had Latin. </sentence><sentence id="2692">The professor looks at it. </sentence><sentence id="2693">I'm sorry everything is in order but you have no Latin. </sentence><sentence id="2694">You have to take a pre-entrance exam in Latin. </sentence><sentence id="2695">I said you know if after all these years I don't know if I remember too many things and my German was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="2696">I just started learning German. </sentence><sentence id="2697">What language do you speak? </sentence><sentence id="2698">Polish, Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2699">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2700">You speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2701">I speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2702">So he give me two days to come back and take an exam in Latin in the

</sentence><sentence id="2705">I want to know if you were acquainted with Latin, if you remember something and so on, which I did many things. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And he was satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="2707">He gave me a passing grade and here I was back in <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2708">So, we struggled quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="2709">It was very difficult financially, but the <span class="building">Zionist Organization</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, helped us out. </sentence><sentence id="2710">They rent a <span class="building">school</span> for the whole group of us. </sentence><sentence id="2711">And we lived in that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2712">They fed us, warm, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2713">They gave us blankets, gave us suits, you know, from <span class="building">American Joint</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2714">We felt like human beings. </sentence><sentence id="2715">We did regain our dignity, slowly, and one day somebody came to us and said, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="2716">I just came back from the <span class="region">British Zone</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and I was on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2717">Run into somebody who is a relative of yours. </sentence><sentence id="2718">So I said, what? </sentence><sentence id="2719">What's his name? </sentence><sentence id="2720">So, he mentioned first name Baruch, Baruch. </sentence><sentence id="2721">I don't have anybody in my family named Baruch. </sentence><sentence id="2722">Then Lucine remembered, you know what, that my cousin, who was our only witness on our wedding in <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2723">He must be him. </sentence><sentence id="2724">Well that's the address. </sentence><sentence id="2725">We wrote a letter to him. </sentence><sentence id="2726">He wrote back. </sentence><sentence id="2727">It was him. </sentence><sentence id="2728">He survived the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2729">He made contact with an aunt in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2730">It was his real aunt. </sentence><sentence id="2731">It was my wife's second <span class="dlf">line</span> aunt actually because the aunt with the baby in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span> that went to the <span class="building">Hotel Polski</span> was her sister in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2732">But we wrote a letter to them. </sentence><sentence id="2733">We didn't ask for anything,  9 but they start showering us with gifts, packages, food, chocolates, cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="2734">I didn't smoke. </sentence><sentence id="2735">I was selling on <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2736">He, her uncle asked me if I needed anything. </sentence><sentence id="2737">He can send me to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2738">He said, "do you want papers?" </sentence><sentence id="2739">I try to get you papers to come to <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2740">But first you have to graduate and get your diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2741">Don't you ever come to the <span class="country">States</span> without diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2742">You'd be nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2743">If you be medical doctor then you be somebody. </sentence><sentence id="2744">Your future be assured. </sentence><sentence id="2745">As difficult it might be for now, I remind you of a family in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, mind you, people I never met, I never knew, Lucine never met, never knew. </sentence><sentence id="2746">She knew of this them but was a distant family through marriage of her uncle. </sentence><sentence id="2747">He start sending me packages of certain things, medication. </sentence><sentence id="2748">I sell on <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And we live like kings then. </sentence><sentence id="2750">So after <span class="building">graduate medical school</span>, we throw a party for maybe 50 people, our friends and so on like one family. </sentence><sentence id="2751">We became one 93 family all the refugee, students and their relatives were all one family. </sentence><sentence id="2752">They substitute for our lost brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2753">Their parents were our parents. </sentence><sentence id="2754">We used to call them mom

our composure you know and maybe regain faith in humanity. </sentence><sentence id="2757">And slowly we registered in <span class="building">American Embassy</span>, and here we met a little difficulty with one lady. </sentence><sentence id="2758">This was the time of Korean War. </sentence><sentence id="2759">We registered with all the proper documents. </sentence><sentence id="2760">We got a visa to enter <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2761">The only thing still, I didn't finish my final exam to get my diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2762">She said, you have a deadline to meet. </sentence><sentence id="2763">You have to go right now. </sentence><sentence id="2764">You have three weeks time to go. </sentence><sentence id="2765">What am I going to do? </sentence><sentence id="2766">I cannot get my diploma in three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2767">My final exam is not until a few months from now on. </sentence><sentence id="2768">She was very annoyed with it. </sentence><sentence id="2769">She said "I have my son fighting <span class="country">Korea</span> and you have a chance to go to <span class="country">United States</span> and you refuse to." </sentence><sentence id="2770">I said, "look, I'm not refusing. </sentence><sentence id="2771">And I try to explain to her where I stand, what's the problem." </sentence><sentence id="2772">She was not very compassionate, couldn't understand, and said, well, if that's how it is, then you might lose your entry. </sentence><sentence id="2773">I said, well, if that's what's going to be, that's what's going to be. </sentence><sentence id="2774">If I go there now I be nobody. </sentence><sentence id="2775">I only ask you to allow to finish my studies. </sentence><sentence id="2776">It's only a few months, can you ask for an extension? </sentence><sentence id="2777">No, I can't. </sentence><sentence id="2778">So we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2779">This was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="2780">We are very depressed, upset and depressed. </sentence><sentence id="2781">We worn out. </sentence><sentence id="2782">I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2783">I knew we could not stay in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> because foreigners were not allowed to stay and practice in profession. </sentence><sentence id="2784">You could only study. </sentence><sentence id="2785">And the one day we get a note, a letter from the <span class="building">embassy</span> to report to the <span

</sentence><sentence id="2791">I just graduate and got my diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2792">So, I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2793">Either this first lady had second thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="2794">Maybe she was bitter that her son was in <span class="country">Korea</span> fighting. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I felt very bad for her. </sentence><sentence id="2796">I was very sad but, maybe she did understand my problem and quietly maybe she helped me. </sentence><sentence id="2797">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2798">I never seen her. </sentence><sentence id="2799">I wish I would. </sentence><sentence id="2800">And we packed and went to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2801">We
