<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Why did you join this, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Because I had to join -- I mean it was very customary for students, university students, Jewish, to join <span class="building">fraternities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">There were three <span class="building">fraternities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">This one was <span class="interior space">left wing</span>, which had belief in being left. </sentence><sentence id="252">One was something in between and many of my friends were in this <span class="building">El Al fraternity</span>, and that's where I went. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Yes, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="274">I don't believe it can be limited to future of Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">We were always talking about Jews as a nation, not only <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">We never referred that Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span> should be better off or concerned about Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">We always talked about Jews as a <span class="country">nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And speaking about their comfort, yes, we were comfortable until "34 or "35. </sentence><sentence id="279">At that time, my father already -- Hitler was already in Germany-- he already, in <span class="country">Germany</span>, he couldn't do business with <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">At the same time, he already had certain problems with his health because of smoking, which he never stopped smoking. </sentence><sentence id="281">Then things started to go down, and when war started and the Communists came in, which was in 1940, then we were just existing. </sentence><sentence id="282">We were not poor, but we were not well to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="631">So, actually <span class="building">Lithuanian Jewish Society</span> was the leaders of this <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">Then they continued going from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">They came in our <span class="building">house</span>, which we lived in front of a multi story <span class="building">building</span>, not multi story, maybe five story <span class="building">buildings</span>, and back, it was like a one story <span

they turned around and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="643">So this was the end of this. </sentence><sentence id="644">Then in the next few days, the German Army moved in, and they issued the white arm bands, not to lay down the weapons and follow only rules and regulation which German Government Occupation had issued, that is was illegal to go from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="645">Then the Germans gave a systematic way how to eliminate Jews. </sentence><sentence id="646">Actually, there was no more fear that
