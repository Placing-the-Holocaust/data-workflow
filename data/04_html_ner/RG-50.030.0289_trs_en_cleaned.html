<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="156">We knew all of what was happening, but people were very naive at that time, and they said it's fine, it's in <span class="country">Germany</span>, it's not in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">But everybody was very much concerned and tried to do something, but nobody knew what to do because for one, iten one; they were comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="158">They had <span class="building">houses</span>, <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">They were established and somehow they didn't feel like separating from everything that they had created in their lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="160">Some people, many left <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, not many -- I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="161">Maybe one or two percent of Jewish people left. </sentence><sentence id="162">Just for example, my brother left, and we were going to leave, but we couldn't as I stated before. </sentence><sentence id="163">Just an example, when German came to <span class="country">Poland</span> and started the atrocities of killing Jews, many Polish Jews came to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, run away. </sentence><sentence id="164">At that time there was <span class="building">Japanese consulate</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, who I don't know the reason why, was giving out Visas for Jews to go to <span class="country">Japan</span> through <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="165">And there were huge <span class="dlf">lines</span> in front of the <span class="building">Consulate</span> to obtain a visa to go to <span class="country">Japan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And this was mostly Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="167">Very few Lithuanian Jews were there, because Polish Jews had already the experience of being under Nazi occupation for a relatively short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="168">Lithuanian Jews, probably they didn't think this was the right thing to do or were not ready to do it. </sentence><sentence id="169">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="170">But I just recently was in <span class="country">Europe</span> and read an article about it, this week, and it was described in detail what happened to this <span class="building">Japanese Consul</span>, I forget, I believe his name is, and the people who obtained visas mostly were  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Were you involved in any political organizations while you were in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Why did you join this, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Because I had to join -- I mean it was very customary for students, university students, Jewish, to join <span class="building">fraternities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">There were three <span class="building">fraternities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">This one was <span class="interior space">left wing</span>, which had belief in being left. </sentence><sentence id="200">One was something in between and many of my friends were in this <span class="building">El Al fraternity</span>, and that's where I went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: But you were concerned about the principles that <span class="populated place">Trobotinsky</span> (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Yes, I believed in it to a certain -- I didn't believe in what's called Jewish Socialists, or left wingers. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't believe in that. </sentence><sentence id="209">I believed more in the <span class="interior space">right wing</span>, with <span class="building">Trobinski</span> (ph) or what was called Batar (ph), and I believe it was a goal to achieve a better life for Jews was better following <span class="building">Trobinski</span> or Batar, as compared to <span class="interior space">left wing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">Or there were quite a few Jews in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> who are Communist. </sentence><sentence id="211">Communist was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="212">There was a particular movement of communist in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, and a high percentage of members were Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: The reason I'm asking is that it sounds like your family had a fairly comfortable life style, and you were not highly religious and yet you were following -- you were concerned about the future of Jews in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Yes, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="222">I don't believe it can be limited to future of Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">We were always talking about Jews as a nation, not only <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">We never referred that Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span> should be better off or concerned about Jews of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">We always talked about Jews as a <span class="country">nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And speaking about their comfort, yes, we were comfortable until "34 or "35. </sentence><sentence id="227">At that time, my father already -- Hitler was already in Germany-- he already, in <span class="country">Germany</span>, he couldn't do business with <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">At the same time, he already had certain problems with his health because of smoking, which he never stopped smoking. </sentence><sentence id="229">Then things started to go down, and when war started and the Communists came in, which was in 1940, then we were just existing. </sentence><sentence id="230">We were not poor, but we were not well to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: I do want to ask you about how things changed with the Communists, but I think first I just want to get more of a sense of Konov before the War. </sentence><sentence id="242">Culturally, what the life was like there, was there a lot of opportunity? </sentence><sentence id="243">Was there a good life for a Jewish boy like yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
