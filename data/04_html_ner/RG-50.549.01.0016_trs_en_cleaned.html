<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: Do you remember if you prayed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: | can't remember that, | can't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="43">I, | mean | know all the prayers because | had to pretend, you know, but | don't, as | said, it's hard to be quite authentic, but being, knowing the religious feelings that | don't harbor now, or the anti-religious feelings that | harbor and have, apparently, since really childhood, according to my parents, it's hard to believe that | was swayed by anything more than the sense of, this is going to protect me, you know, so maybe it's worth doing. </sentence><sentence id="44">But not, | don't think | had, | certainly never believed in Jesus Christ or anything of the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection kind. </sentence><sentence id="45">| mean, that stuff was not believable, but, not that any other was, but | mean this in particular, | found very hard to stomach, so, but as | said, the atmosphere and the big voices and the, you know, the echoes in the <span class="building">church</span> and all the people that looked so, umm, you know, they looked very happy to be there and they looked like they were participating and so on, and | was participating but knowing | was a fake, you know, and, but | don't think | ever prayed to anybody with conviction. </sentence><sentence id="46">Never. </sentence><sentence id="47">So | don't think | did. </sentence><sentence id="48">But | did pray, because | certainly had to go to communion and say all the words and go to confession and confess to sins that | made up. </sentence><sentence id="49">You know, things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="50">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: You were a performer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: | think to some extent, but that was part of the game, you know, if | had to change names, | had to change everything about myself, so |, but | knew it was fake, you know, | never, | think, totally took on the other identity. </sentence><sentence id="64">| don't think | ever did, | mean whoever | was, | mean | certainly got, I'm sure | got to some extent, you know, damaged by this whole experience, but maybe not, not as much as, if one listens to the scripture and you could expect somebody who would be much worse shape than |, lam, maybe, | think | was in pretty bad shape, actually, right after the war. </sentence><sentence id="65">| was really in, but nobody had time to pay attention, so | just had to pull myself together, | think that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="66">| don't think anyone had the time to pay any attention to me. </sentence><sentence id="67">So | just had to survive, which | had learned, you know, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="68">So, that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: That's the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="78">But, it's very difficult, you know, | am a very successful person, | mean |, and when, that's why | don't like to go to reunions of hidden children anymore because | feel that maybe I'm just an elitist, you know, and that's all there is to it, but |, there are a lot of people who are still whining about this and it's, | don't, really don't want to downplay it in any sense, but it's past and a lot of people have bad things happen to them in life. </sentence><sentence id="79">And if you're going to just focus on those things, you're just not going to get anywhere and |, | can't, | cannot go and sit there and talk about this over and over and over. </sentence><sentence id="80">And, you know, maybe it's denial for me which is, that's possible, too, | just don't want to deal with it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="81">| mean, I'm happy to tell you my story, but | don't think that what's happening in my life now or let's say to a great extent, has that much to do with that experience. </sentence><sentence id="82">| think I've, | know myself pretty well now and I, | can tell, you know, where things are coming from more than just blaming it all on the war and everything of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="83">So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: You're wearing, are those diamond earrings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Are those from your family? </sentence><sentence id="96"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="99"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="101">Well, they're actually, my husband gave them to me, but all our families are in diamonds, so, | mean both my parents and his parents were both into diamonds, so that's <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: One of the things | was curious about reading your family history, your father's history, is that you're feeling toward diamonds now, because you had talked about how, when you fled, your mother took the diamonds and threw them out the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="106">That's quite a dramatic image. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yeah, | always try to, you know, save some, to try and sell them and that's all they had, was diamonds. </sentence><sentence id="108">They had nothing, no <span class="dlf">property</span>, no money really to speak of, but the diamonds that they were dealing with, they could try and sell to survive. </sentence><sentence id="109">So, that's... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: So the ones in your ears aren't part of that <span class="spatial object">pile</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="116">They're not. </sentence><sentence id="117">I, | didn't, there is nothing, | mean the only diamonds actually that survived the war, was my mother's engagement ring, but no, my in-laws, actually, because they came here, so they, they fled, but they fled as a family and they didn't really go through any <span class="populated place">camps</span> or anything, so whatever they took with them they, except for what they had to spend to bribe officials along the way to survive, they came with quite a bit of diamonds with them, so my mother-in-laws jewelry that she gave me along the years, those are really pre-war, many of them. </sentence><sentence id="118">My mother didn't have that much to begin with and she didn't, she wasn't able to keep much of it and so, the only thing is her engagement ring, that's the only thing that actually survived the war and | have that. </sentence><sentence id="119">So, that's pretty nice. </sentence><sentence id="120">So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Do you wear it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="130">No, | put that away. </sentence><sentence id="131">| have my own engagement ring, which | actually very rarely wear. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, and my mom just passed away, you know, and it's very hard for me to take her jewels and put it on, | just put them away someplace. </sentence><sentence id="133">And | think, my daughter isn't married and if she does, at some point, | want to give it to her. </sentence><sentence id="134">Because she was very close to my mother so | would give it to her. </sentence><sentence id="135">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: All right, I'm not going to ask quite about that, but you said there was a song about it and | was wondering of you remembered the song? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Umm, yes, there was a song that just came back to me not too long ago which had to do with getting up in the morning and having to go wash. </sentence><sentence id="150">How was that? </sentence><sentence id="151"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection [Singing in French]. </sentence><sentence id="152">So that was a song to get our, [French phrase], which is whatever. </sentence><sentence id="153">And [French phrase] was, is that sweet potato or whatever it is, | don't know if | remember that song. </sentence><sentence id="154">It will come back maybe. </sentence><sentence id="155">If | think about it, it won't, but it might just spring up at some point. </sentence><sentence id="156">There's a fellow that lives in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> who is my childhood friend and he's now the only one alive because his parents died just over the last two years, they were in their 80's and his sister, unfortunately, was a very good friend of mine, and she died at age 21 in childbirth, so he's the only, and he seems to have a better memory than | do for these things. </sentence><sentence id="157">| mean, he actually went back to the place where we had been hidden and looked up the priest who had been in charge of the place and it apparently has not turned into some kind of a <span class="building">hotel</span> or <span class="building">inn</span> and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Where is this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: This is in Von Deen(ph), which is in the <span class="env feature">Pyrenees</span> and he recognized it, he said he really did and he took some pictures and he showed me. </sentence><sentence id="171">| don't think | remember it quite as well as he does. </sentence><sentence id="172">And we're the same age, so it's not a matter, he's six months older, so it's not a matter, | think | just tuned out a lot of it. </sentence><sentence id="173">Just tuned it out, it was just too awful. </sentence><sentence id="174">So | don't think | would really recognize it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: You were, until you were 10, you were the only child, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Toward your mother, for example. </sentence><sentence id="189">Responsibility to kind of keep alive and keep going? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Well, | think I, | took a lot of responsibility on, for that friend of mine who, because we were together and she was two years younger and as | was, | would say essentially, anorectic(ph) and she, but not anorectic in terms of throwing up, but just wouldn't eat, | mean | was just not interested in food, but not that | had an image of being fat or what goes along with anorexia these days, just, just so distraught that | couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="191">But she on the contrary, being upset, she wanted to eat more, every time, so we were the opposite and we would go in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and steal food for her at night and so | was, | felt very responsible for her. </sentence><sentence id="192">| don't think | felt responsible for my mother or to stay alive for any other reason than | just wanted to be alive. </sentence><sentence id="193">You know, not for any particular reason. </sentence><sentence id="194">No, | don't think, | think, | can't remember if my mother, you know, felt or made me feel very safe, | can't say that. </sentence><sentence id="195">| think | did feel abandoned quite frequently because she was gone a lot. </sentence><sentence id="196">So I, no, | don't think there was any consideration of my mother, of me doing something for her, protecting her,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="204"> | think it was clearly the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="205">Even though | didn't feel that protected by her, | felt more protected by playing the Catholic girl and going to <span class="building">church</span> with our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="206">You know, | felt a lot more safe than being with her. </sentence><sentence id="207">And in some ways, when she didn't learn, she didn't know French very well and she learned it, you know, on the run and she had a pretty heavy accent, even though she learned the language, and so | didn't feel comfortable with her. </sentence><sentence id="208">| mean, | sort of thought she was going to get us into trouble more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="209">And |, | don't know if | said that on the tape, but | was very nasty, | mean | was extremely nasty, and you know, just plain old angry. </sentence><sentence id="210">And | threatened the people that she used to put up with the denouncing them to the Germans, thinking they're not going to catch me because I'm this French girl, you know. </sentence><sentence id="211">But they'll catch you. </sentence><sentence id="212">And scaring people to death, you know, just scaring them to death. </sentence><sentence id="213">And it was silly, | mean | was this six year old, | really wasn't going to go up to, and | knew that | was never going to do that and | knew that | was just as, as much in danger as they were, but | could go out and pretend to be whoever | was and they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="214">You know, they didn't know the language or they didn't appear to be totally French, you know, and also | would really torture them, make them feel very sad. </sentence><sentence id="215">Some of them have, you know, they're all dying out now, but they reminded me of that frequently as | went back to visit my mother, which | did frequently. </sentence><sentence id="216">So, | was not a nice person, not a nice kid, | mean just not at all. </sentence><sentence id="217">Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="218">And you're interested in what's happening after the war, so after the war, in <span class="building">school</span>, | mean | was an absolute terror. </sentence><sentence id="219">| mean, a completely uncontrollable terror. </sentence><sentence id="220">And, but | was smart, you know, and | knew | could get away with it because our class was made up of just really the dregs of the <span class="env feature">earth</span> and, you know, people of all ages speaking different languages. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: How many languages did you know then? </sentence><sentence id="250"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well then, | knew, | don't know what | knew because | grew up in Yiddish and Polish and | learned French really well, so at least those three | knew. </sentence><sentence id="254">But! </sentence><sentence id="255">didn't get to practice that, those that much, | mean | went to <span class="building">school</span> and it was French, so | spoke French at <span class="building">school</span> and then they taught me Hebrew, they started to in that <span class="building">school</span> and, you know, | just had great ease of learning so they used to parade me in front of, you know, they were trying desperately to get money for the <span class="building">school</span> and so the donors came and, you know, you have to parade the monkeys in front of them, so they, | was their monkey, you know, they knew that they could rely on me for giving the right answers and reading and doing all these things to see their wonderful methods of teaching and so | would really take advantage of that. </sentence><sentence id="256">| mean, | knew this was a game for them, you know, it was a great thing to have somebody to show and | would just totally, totally not follow any rules. </sentence><sentence id="257">| would jump on the <span class="spatial object">desks</span> and | would be, you know, when there was no inspection, when they came for inspection | performed, | did everything according to what they expected me to do, but as soon as they left, you know, these donors and inspectors and whatnot, | would just go wild, just wild. </sentence><sentence id="258">In fact, a couple of, about six months, well eight months ago, | was in <span class="country">Belgium</span> visiting my mother, just a week before she died, and we went to a go-away party for my uncle who is also 80-something and who moved to <span class="country">Israel</span> with his family. </sentence><sentence id="259">So my mother and | went to it and one of my Hebrew teachers from that time was there and a very strange thing happened because | had not seen the man in, oh probably 30 years, and he came up and he says, "Is that you?" </sentence><sentence id="260">And | said, "Yes". </sentence><sentence id="261">And he says, "You know, look at my gray hair, you did this to me". </sentence><sentence id="262">He said, well me and, you know, a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="263">But then, so we talked awhile, then it was really funny because his daughter was there and she said, "I don't know how he recognized you because he's blind and he doesn't see anything". </sentence><sentence id="264">Because | couldn't tell, you know, | saw him and | greeted him and just from the voice, or | don't know what, | mean it was very funny, very funny. </sentence><sentence id="265">So | really made an impression on this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="interior space">kitchen</span> was all the way in the front, behind it was something which was more, was the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> | would say, and then in the back of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1087">A: Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, even though they didn't live that much physically a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they lived spiritually and culturally in a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there was very little mixing. </sentence><sentence id="1088">So the only traces of anti-semitism were, | have a friend who lives down in <span class="populated place">Boston</span>, she's several years older, and we sometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one kind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll greet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive? </sentence><sentence id="1089">And she said that's how they greeted her when she came back to <span class="building">school</span>, like, , gee, you know, | thought you were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1090">So, that was the atmosphere among the Flemish, although many had been hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1091">They really then had a concerted effort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair number of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it was like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind of a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1092">But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't feel that great. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that we had <span class="building">school</span> on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And so, | was already really, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do well in <span class="building">school</span> because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and putting them together, but not having a coherent view of things. </sentence><sentence id="1095">It was, | missed, you know, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know, higher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Missing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up, whereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you know, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing three or four or five hours of really important work. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And then | had to go after Sabbath, pick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="building">collection house</span>, but like barely, and try and copy it over. </sentence><sentence id="1098">| mean, it was hell. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And then, when the Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss Saturday, of course, Sunday no <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because Sunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and getting ready and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how | felt when | got to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1102">| mean, the people were talking about things | had absolutely no clue about and the teacher said, "Well, you know, you want to observe your religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1103">You'll just whatever, you know, do it yourself". </sentence><sentence id="1104">So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable years. </sentence><sentence id="1105">But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration papers, he had applied to come to this <span class="country">country</span> in 1933, and of course, the Americans had no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers and they figured by, like , in'51, he'd be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1106">But in "51, his number came up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big panic in <span class="country">Europe</span> that this was going to turn up to be World War III. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And so my father said, "I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that". </sentence><sentence id="1108">So we all left and we came here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
