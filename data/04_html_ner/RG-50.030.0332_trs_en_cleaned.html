<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1656">A: And they mostly went to the Gentile soldiers, or partisans, they were more safer with them. </sentence><sentence id="1657">Because let's say if you are a pretty girl and you have a Jewish boyfriend, right, and there comes a, we used to call them Bostochnik (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1658">That's the Russian, from west, you know, all the way from the <span class="region">eastern part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1659">So, if they had their eyes on somebody let's say it wouldn't do anybody any good, any Jewish boy to go with that girl because he's going to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1660">He can take a boy and kill him for that too, just to be able to go with that girl. </sentence><sentence id="1661">So, there was, yes, yes, a lot of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1727">See, we were inexperienced how to live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking. </sentence><sentence id="1728">To us, it was new. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Well, how do you know how to, what to do and when to do. </sentence><sentence id="1730">So in the beginning, yes they would. </sentence><sentence id="1731">But later on they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1732">They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Oh, yes, we had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1742">Q: So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1744">A: No, the same thing, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> because they made every <span class="populated place">city</span> Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they? </sentence><sentence id="1746">We didn't know the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> that they are alive or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1747">Sometimes the farmers used to come from the <span class="populated place">city</span> and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know, what's going on but other than that they didn't have radios. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1752">Q: When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the only Jews alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1754">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1756">Q: How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1758">A: I'll tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="1759">When we saw the <span class="building">Red Army</span>, this was it. </sentence><sentence id="1760">Now we are alive, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1761">So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course this gave us a big boost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1766">Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1768">A: Yeah, <span class="country">Poland</span>, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1769">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1770">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1771"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1777">Q: Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you depressed? </sentence><sentence id="1778">It's a strange feeling isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1781">A: Nope. </sentence><sentence id="1782">You know why? </sentence><sentence id="1783">Because we took it each day as it comes. </sentence><sentence id="1784">We did not know what tomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to take for them to kill us all. </sentence><sentence id="1785">So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything. </sentence><sentence id="1786">No hopes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1793">Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any difference to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1795">A: Well, to me, no. </sentence><sentence id="1796">But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help. </sentence><sentence id="1798">You know what I'm talking? </sentence><sentence id="1799">They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1800">They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1801">They used to turn down from the <span class="env feature">sky</span> sort of, you know, and fly away. </sentence><sentence id="1802">They never came to <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1803">They did not <span class="region">land</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1813">Q: But you would find out about this through the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1815">A: Nope. </sentence><sentence id="1816">You see they, I'll tell you why. </sentence><sentence id="1817">Because they had a certain place where there's no <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1818">It has to be a big place, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans knew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication, whatever it is and they went back up. </sentence><sentence id="1819">But at least we knew that <span class="country">Russia</span> knows that we're here. </sentence><sentence id="1820">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="1821">SO, it gave us a different feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1822">But eh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1831">Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans? </sentence><sentence id="1832">How did you know this was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1835">A: Because it happened in this part of <span class="populated place">Vivorg</span> (ph) exactly then, you know, and what can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="1836">They had to have a <span class="dlf">field</span> where to drop it. </sentence><sentence id="1837">You should see how the <span class="env feature">sky</span> was lighting up. </sentence><sentence id="1838">You can, you wanted to dance and sing, but you couldn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1839">But this, this is all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
