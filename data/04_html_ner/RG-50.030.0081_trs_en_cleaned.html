<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: In 1939 there was a panic. </sentence><sentence id="208">Of course we expected things to come because the fear that we are going to destroy you, everybody is going to -- we need this <span class="interior space">room</span>, we need that <span class="interior space">room</span> for our German people. </sentence><sentence id="209">We are growing now. </sentence><sentence id="210">My assignment is to extend <span class="country">Germany</span> as far <span class="region">east</span> as possible so we'll destroy you Poles and Jews and everybody has to go. </sentence><sentence id="211">We knew that there is nothing good coming. </sentence><sentence id="212">And of course, they need the manpower for work, so they were arresting a lot of Polish young people, men and women, and sending them to <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">It wasn't <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, yet, just forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="214"> They used to work on <span class="dlf">farms</span> or in <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">As far as Jews are concerned, they were very restricted. </sentence><sentence id="216">They couldn't change their place of <span class="building">residence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">They couldn't move, they couldn't communicate, letters or stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="218">They would have to be controlled by the German officials. </sentence><sentence id="219">Every little thing you have to apply to the <span class="populated place">County</span> which was, of course, in charge by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="220">The Germans were in charge. </sentence><sentence id="221">You had to get permission for everything, for food, for everything. </sentence><sentence id="222">For clothing, there was a shortage of clothing, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="223">There was a shortage of food. </sentence><sentence id="224">And, of course, from time to time they demanded from Jewish people to surrender some valuable things in an official or unofficial way, like bribes, you know, trying to get a permit for something, so it cost in the form of gold or something valuable. </sentence><sentence id="225">Those restrictions, they couldn't move from one place to another. </sentence><sentence id="226">In that situation, many young people, Jewish people, people say 20 and up, they knew what was going to happen, so they decided to run away from that situation. </sentence><sentence id="227">The Polish partisans started organizing so they joined them in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, or they simply moved to another place with false identification documents. </sentence><sentence id="228">The one case I remember, the next <span class="dlf">door</span> people his name Shpinrot(ph) had a daughter about 18 years old, Mauka Spinrot, she actually was a friend of one of my brothers, so we talked her into accepting a forged 1.d. </sentence><sentence id="229">card, like a passport. </sentence><sentence id="230">I mean, it had more value than just an ordinary i.d. </sentence><sentence id="231">card. </sentence><sentence id="232">It was like a passport, showing all the details, names the date of birth, religion, her age, and something like that. </sentence><sentence id="233">So, we issued the card for Makur (ph) I believe, a Polish name, and of course, Roman Catholic and everything. </sentence><sentence id="234">So, she took that. </sentence><sentence id="235">They were very grateful for this and she volunteered for the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">So, this way the Germans treated as one of Poles and no questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="237">I'm not sure because I wasn't there, but I'm sure that she survived. </sentence><sentence id="238">This was the first case I remember. </sentence><sentence id="239">After that, we started doing this more often. </sentence><sentence id="240">Of course, my people, I belonged to the <span class="building">underground organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">That was the organization before , and of course they wanted to know everything and of course they were helping and all that. </sentence><sentence id="242">They liked the idea because we kept stealing the forms just for the i.d. </sentence><sentence id="243">cards and giving them to the whole <span class="region">county</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">So, I am sure that quite a number of Jewish people got those forged i.d.cards and they were able to move around to survive. </sentence><sentence id="245">I'm sure about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: So, mostly what you did was steal the <span class="dlf">i.d</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">cards, and other people did the forgery? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: If I remember correctly, we used to send, because there were some partisans, I mean not very much activity there because they were just organizing everything, so we sent some young fellow, at least two people to join that partisans group, because they were good soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="308">I believe they used to be in the <span class="building">Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">The rule was two years in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="310">They  were very well trained soldiers, intelligent guys, so I think we were doing very well there with Polish partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: You had a lot of Jewish friends, your family did, but did the other Roman Catholics in the <span class="populated place">town</span> try to help the Jews too? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: All of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: All of them, because that was the idea, to clean the place from Jews because of the <span class="populated place">Ghettos</span>, organization of <span class="populated place">Ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">They moved them, I think to <span class="populated place">Kyertza</span> (ph), which is about 50 miles from <span class="populated place">Shedowuf</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="427">So, you can imagine what happened to that <span class="spatial object">column</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">I don't know, in that <span class="spatial object">column</span> could have been 1,000 people originally. </sentence><sentence id="429">If 500 reached that destination, maybe more, maybe 600, but the rest small children, no food, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="430">I know because I was in an evacuation like that in 1945 from one <span class="populated place">camp</span> to another, so I know how it goes. </sentence><sentence id="431">No food, just shooting, that's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: Well, it started right after the end of hostilities in October 1939. </sentence><sentence id="645">I have a feeling -- it's a very well known fact that they were prepared for things, for the defeat, because after all, the Germans were very well prepared and we are a poor nation. </sentence><sentence id="646">We were not able to be prepared to such an extent as Germans were. </sentence><sentence id="647">So, they made plans for underground activities because they were hoping that the Allies in the <span class="region">West</span>, <span class="country">England</span> and <span class="country">France</span> would definitely help. </sentence><sentence id="648">Sooner or later, we'll have to be prepared, officially if the Army is no longer in existence at least <span class="interior space">underground</span> is active. </sentence><sentence id="649">So, they started organizing right away, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="650">On two levels, first of all the most important level was the military preparation. </sentence><sentence id="651">And the other <span class="interior space">level</span> was the <span class="building">civil administration</span> because they had to keep a network of people for the administration in case of the German occupation will collapse we'll have to take it over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Did everyone know about it then and how did you find out about it and how was communication take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Well, one day in , men I used to know when I used to go to <span class="building">high school</span>, came and he says that he reprsents the underground organization would I be willing to join that. </sentence><sentence id="663">Things are -- with my background because I was active in <span class="building">boy scouts</span> for all my life. </sentence><sentence id="664">I was a boy scout, scout master at the very end. </sentence><sentence id="665">Military preparation and training, so you will have to join us and help us. </sentence><sentence id="666">So, I agreed, and I had to be sworn in and originally we started with a small <span class="spatial object">unit</span> like I'd say 85 people that we could know of each other. </sentence><sentence id="667">The first assignment was just to take care of the <span class="spatial object">weapons</span>, prepare the weapons, hide them and keep them. </sentence><sentence id="668">That was quite an extensive activity and many people were involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="669"> 0 Another <span class="region">area</span> was training. </sentence><sentence id="670">Of course other guys like say myself I was about 22 years old at the time, so I didn't have to be trained, but I had to be an instructor in a little group of say ten young fellows. </sentence><sentence id="671">I had to train them. </sentence><sentence id="672">Later on I was asked to join the officers group because I wasn't an officer. </sentence><sentence id="673">So, I took part in the training of that underground <span class="building">officers school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="674">Of course we had lectures. </sentence><sentence id="675">We had all kinds of assignments outside in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">All kinds of instructors, professional officers from the Polish Army, experts on explosives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: How did your group communicate with other groups? </sentence><sentence id="693">How did you find out what else was going on and how long were you training the small group you had; a long time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="696">A: That was training after the level of sergeant, but I was there about six months maybe, and in my <span class="building">school</span> I was about seven, eight months, at the <span class="building">officers school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="697">Of course, that was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="698">We are meeting -- only once I remember they decided to do some exercises in the <span class="dlf">field</span> so we met, about twenty people there. </sentence><sentence id="699">Some of them friends, some of them from different <span class="region">areas</span>, from different <span class="populated place">cities</span>, but anyway no more than that. </sentence><sentence id="700">Besides the assignment was to concentrate on the communications to interrupt communications, to destroy telephone communication, to destroy some of the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="701">So we concentrated on the explosives, theory and some exercises with the real stuff, but not too much because it was very expensive and dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="702">It was dangerous, so we kept this to the minimum. </sentence><sentence id="703">We took part in the organized group we took part in certain things like I mentioned that the compulsory collection of the farm products, of the <span class="spatial object">registers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="704">Each small <span class="populated place">city</span> had a register, extensive control of the people, of the farmers, of the amounts of farm products to be delivered. </sentence><sentence id="705">There was official record of that and they kept that in those <span class="building">offices</span> in the administration of the <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="706">So, at one point, the <span class="building">underground authorities</span> decided to destroy all of this just to show that the Germans will be helpless in case like that. </sentence><sentence id="707">They lose control of what was delivered, what is supposed to be delivered. </sentence><sentence id="708">They lost control of it so we worked on that systematically. </sentence><sentence id="709">We are destroying, and it worked very well, because people were able to hide more food for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="710">The Germans started panicking because so little food was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="711">OF course the communication, the communication was a very important thing in a case like that. </sentence><sentence id="712">We had our own communication between <span class="populated place">cities</span>, so in other words, we knew in advance that the Gestapo is coming to our place. </sentence><sentence id="713">But the official way, there was no <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> because we destroyed the telephone connections. </sentence><sentence id="714">But we knew because we had our own <span class="dlf">networks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="715">End of Tape #1  1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: Let's go back and talk about the communication and how you knew the Gestapo was coming? </sentence><sentence id="737">How did the communications get to you? --- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: Tell me what your parents knew about what you were doing and what they thought? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: Well, my parents, of course, they knew that I was involved in something, especially early in 1939 and early 1940 because some strangers were coming, people they didn't know from my organization used to visit me on special assignments. </sentence><sentence id="755">I used to disappear for a number of days. </sentence><sentence id="756">So, naturally at <span class="building">home</span> there were always questions, where have you been. </sentence><sentence id="757">You better watch out. </sentence><sentence id="758">This is not good. </sentence><sentence id="759">You'll have to pay for this one day. </sentence><sentence id="760">Be careful. </sentence><sentence id="761">So, they knew quite well. </sentence><sentence id="762">Of course, I wasn't going to tell them the details, obviously I am involved and I should actually -- you should give me your blessings not to criticize me on that. </sentence><sentence id="763">My parents understood and they were 100 percent behind me. </sentence><sentence id="764">My father, naturally, was very much affected by what was going on because the Gestapo used to come a couple of times a month, at the beginning especially, and they used to call him and they used to ask him questions about my activities before I got arrested, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="765">They wanted to simply to coordinate things which they know with what was happening, but of course, my father didn't tell them anything. </sentence><sentence id="766">But he paid, with his health forms, because this was too much tension, too much aggravation, and he was suffering from some heart problems, and eventually he had a heart attack in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="767">He couldn't take it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="768">So, that was -- my mother survived, she was probably physically stronger and was able to survive that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: You say you knew in 1943 what was going on in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, but a lot of Polish Jews didn't know what was happening when they were transported from <span class="populated place">Ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Do you think you knew because of the <span class="interior space">underground</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1430">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Important thing is this. </sentence><sentence id="1432">The <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and later on in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> because they started with <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was originally for Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1433">So, a vast majority of prisoners were Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1434">In the year of 1940, "41, "42, it was absolute majority. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Later on they decided to enlarge the <span class="dlf">field</span>, the <span class="region">area</span> of activity so they started <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1436"><span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, if I remember correctly, was mostly for the Jews, but <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> as such the majority of the prisoners in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were Poles, but things were changing all the time, but <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, the prisoners from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were working on the <span class="populated place">Birkenau camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1437">When I arrived in 1943, there was still construction going on. </sentence><sentence id="1438">It wasn't finished, not everything was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1439">So that's the reason that Jews were not aware of actual -- the <span class="populated place">Auschwitz place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They were more aware of <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, other places in --. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1486">Q: The punishment for collaborators, if the <span class="spatial object">AK</span> found out what then happened, and tell me about your specific knowledge of specific cases? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1488">A: Well, the organization was the smallest unit, was I don't know how it was equivalent to a <span class="spatial object">post</span> which would be corresponding to a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Several <span class="spatial object">posts</span> would be a <span class="populated place">county</span>, more or less corresponding to a <span class="populated place">county</span> and several <span class="region">counties</span> again, would be like a <span class="populated place">district</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1490">On our level, it was the smallest <span class="spatial object">unit</span> in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Of course, we had a division of activities was first of all the military activities which included training and preparation for a specific assignments. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Collecting of weapons, ammunition, maintenance, and that will be the military part, as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Then would be a part like a diversion of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Sabotage would have to perform certain tasks, disruption of communication in general or in particular cases according to the situation, according to the needs. </sentence><sentence id="1495">It would be run, usually by soldiers, former soldiers who used to be on active duty in Polish Army, because they used to be most of the time Junior Officers. </sentence><sentence id="1496">Then there would be the political side of it which would be the distribution of <span class="spatial object">press</span> or preparation of future needs of future administration, organizing of future councils which would be planning supply in case of uprising, would be in charge of preparation of food, supplies of food or medications, <span class="building">hospitals</span>, but there was a <span class="interior space">unit</span> also that took care of unfriendly acts of some people who were cooperating with the German authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1497">It could be done in various ways, the most common in situation would be to report some experiences some SS acts, some facts to Gestapo as an act of well loyalty I would say to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1498">For some stupid reason he would discover that he was loyal to the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1499">He started to cooperate with them and he would be reporting all kinds of trespassers like , with the collection of food by farmers, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1500">He would be sabotaging deliveries, so this is -- he would be reporting to Germans all kinds of irregular activities in that <span class="region">area</span>, engaged in which actually were in the interest of Polish population, so these people were not too friendly to Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So, I remember two or three cases that one case was a policeman of Polish nationality who was too eager to please German police, and he hurt so much Polish people, that he was reported to higher authorities, the underground Polish authorities, and the accusations were collected and facts were collected and he was executed in due course. </sentence><sentence id="1502">A similar situation was with another Pole that also was cooperating with German authorities, but not on a more or less on an economical level, like smuggling, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Smuggling was an important part, because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough. </sentence><sentence id="1504">In certain circumstances you have to smuggle, or in many cases they were doing this for gain, but it was a necessary fact, necessary activity for the benefit of Polish population in general. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So if somebody was trying to disrupt this or report some activities of smugglers to German police, the act was unfriendly and if it continued for a number of occasions, so the guy deserved a penalty and in that particular case that I remember, that guy was executed. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Of course, a due course of law was applied to that situation. </sentence><sentence id="1507">There were certain underground jurist, lawyers, judges, of course not  3 employed by the current German administration, but they were original members of Polish jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="1508">So, they were knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1509">They knew the law and they were able to issue a proper decision based on their experience and knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1510">One case I know also, a third case, a Jew who was very friendly with the German police also reporting all kinds of activities to German police and he was I understand the story, he was warned several times not to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1511">He was even warned by some Jewish -- as a matter of fact, his family were telling him to stop that nonsense, but of course he was hoping that this way he will be able to survive, and his family, and so he was also killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1550">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1551">I don't -- you see for me I would have to if things like that took place of similar nature, it was probably after I was arrested because a lot of activities -- I mean the situation was getting more active in the second half of 1943 and the beginning of "44, and I was no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="1552">I don't know, and frankly from people that I know, from those days, there was no such a thing as in a group, in a small group, not many Jews were participating, but if there were and I know of one from a friend of mine, there was not anything anti-semitic about that particular, I think it was two brothers or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1553">They were visitors. </sentence><sentence id="1554">They were visiting a friend a <span class="dlf">mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1555">He had a huge <span class="building">barn</span> and in that <span class="building">barn</span> they were able to come to that <span class="building">barn</span> and from the <span class="env feature">woods</span> were they were members. </sentence><sentence id="1556">They used to come, they used to take some food for the group. </sentence><sentence id="1557">My friend trusted them, and they trusted him. </sentence><sentence id="1558">They even used to have a <span class="spatial object">radio receiver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1559">They used to listen to the broadcast from <span class="populated place">London</span>, together, in that <span class="building">barn</span>, that particular <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1560">It was those two Jews and this friend of mine, and they were very close to that particular partisan group and there was nothing unfriendly because I think they knew each other when they were very small children, like that. </sentence><sentence id="1561">They were more or less of the same age. </sentence></p></dialogue>
