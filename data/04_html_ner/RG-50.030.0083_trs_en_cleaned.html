<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: How did they carry the <span class="spatial object">Torah</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: We carried it in...by...in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="117">You know we wrapped it up in <span class="spatial object">sheets</span> and whatever we had and we just carried it with us. </sentence><sentence id="118">But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know, into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, every day it was somehow worse. </sentence><sentence id="119">Sometimes they wouldn't let us have <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the <span class="building">barracks</span> and what we lived on is on soup. </sentence><sentence id="121">They gave us soup and...and bread. </sentence><sentence id="122">So that in itself was a horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="123">But still you were with the family, especially me as a young adolescent. </sentence><sentence id="124">I wasn't paying much attention to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: How old were you at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: I was between 13 and 14 in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you know, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's got to report to a certain <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with them. </sentence><sentence id="139">So my mother went along with him. </sentence><sentence id="140">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="141">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="142"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: With whom? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: With my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="153">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer shawl, a <span class="spatial object">tallis</span> [NB: tallith] they call it. </sentence><sentence id="154">So they made these men put on these _tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying. </sentence><sentence id="155">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards. </sentence><sentence id="156">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...if you go near there. </sentence><sentence id="157">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard. </sentence><sentence id="158">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="159">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="160">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know. </sentence><sentence id="161">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats. </sentence><sentence id="162">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard. </sentence><sentence id="163">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself. </sentence><sentence id="164">So we stood in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, for a full <span class="spatial object">train</span> load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little <span class="populated place">towns</span> into this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and they told us they're relocating us. </sentence><sentence id="166">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work. </sentence><sentence id="167">And they gave us a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him. </sentence><sentence id="168">So...then when we were packed into this <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> they locked the <span class="dlf">door</span> from the outside and we stayed in this <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> until it...it was midnight and midnight the <span class="spatial object">train</span> started going. </sentence><sentence id="169">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was really, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="171">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="172"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection really chaotic there inside. </sentence><sentence id="173">We didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="174">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense. </sentence><sentence id="175">I...[ don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill. </sentence><sentence id="176">So they were laying there with us. </sentence><sentence id="177">When we got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and we really didn't know about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">The thing is that they...these <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, they had <span class="dlf">windows</span> on top, small <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is. </sentence><sentence id="180">So as we were driving through the <span class="region">country side</span> I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there. </sentence><sentence id="181">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat). </sentence><sentence id="182">I...I really didn't know what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="183">And...and a young adult it just didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something. </sentence><sentence id="184">But it was strange to see these farmers. </sentence><sentence id="185">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat). </sentence><sentence id="186">I told my sister. </sentence><sentence id="187">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me. </sentence><sentence id="188">Well, anyway when we got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> it sort of didn't sink in. </sentence><sentence id="189">I didn't expect that I was brought to a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">I just didn't. </sentence><sentence id="191">But when I got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a very big flame. </sentence><sentence id="192">And it smelled. </sentence><sentence id="193">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something. </sentence><sentence id="194">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="195">Heraus! </sentence><sentence id="196">Heraus!"
