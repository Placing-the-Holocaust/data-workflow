<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Well, the local authorities were the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="126">Many of us were Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="127">We also had, on our part, we had a <span class="building">Jewish organization</span> . </sentence><sentence id="128">So when they needed something, they asked the organization to provide it. </sentence><sentence id="129">Like, for instance, during the springtime, they were asking for people to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And the Germans were providing a list that they needed 500 to 1,000, 1,500 people. </sentence><sentence id="131">So they came and they said that from <span class="populated place">Morava</span>, they needed to send 500 young boys. </sentence><sentence id="132">As it were, we had to provide those 500 young boys. </sentence><sentence id="133">So it was a very hard thing for the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to go around and say, "Look, you have a boy. </sentence><sentence id="134">I want him to go to work." </sentence><sentence id="135">Which we did not know if they are going to come back. </sentence><sentence id="136">Because they took us all the way down to the <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">The was at that time in , and they're  the wintertime, they took us out and cleaned the <span class="dlf">roads</span>, so that the <span class="dlf">roads</span> could be opened for the Germans to bring their supplies. </sentence><sentence id="138">At one time, we were taken out to , it was a little place where the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> was passing. </sentence><sentence id="139">They had a lot of activities with there, so they had to cut the <span class="env feature">woods</span> around the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, around the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">So they cut up the -- they cut the <span class="env feature">woods</span> out for about 100 or 200 feet away from the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>, so they should be able to see. </sentence><sentence id="141">This is the type of work that we had. </sentence><sentence id="142">And cleaning the <span class="dlf">roads</span>, which I was there. </sentence><sentence id="143">I worked from early in the morning till late at night with one piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I have seen with my own eyes like people were just standing there, and within a minute you saw them falling down and being stiff, because it was -- the temperature was 20, 25 below zero. </sentence><sentence id="145">So I was just lucky, I had some good clothing. </sentence><sentence id="146">And then I was young. </sentence><sentence id="147">Just young, that is good to do -- do whatever. </sentence><sentence id="148">When I came <span class="building">home</span>, the depression had set in. </sentence><sentence id="149">I had seen so many people that did not come <span class="building">home</span>, and they would always ask me, "Did you see this boy? </sentence><sentence id="150">Did you see that boy?" </sentence><sentence id="151">And I knew that he is dead, but how can you say that to somebody? </sentence><sentence id="152">That maybe they took him away and he's going to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">But it was a frightening situation. </sentence><sentence id="154">The life in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> proper was a -- you were living with hope. </sentence><sentence id="155">I personally am an optimist. </sentence><sentence id="156">With every day that passed, I said maybe God will help. </sentence><sentence id="157">Maybe something will come of it, and maybe somehow we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="158">But during the wintertime, we suffered tremendously because during the wintertime, you had the sickness. </sentence><sentence id="159">Typhoid fever with spots, that was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="160">It took about two weeks if a person got sick with that sickness. </sentence><sentence id="161">Which I was sick with it, I was sick for two weeks with about 104 temperature, 105. </sentence><sentence id="162">And then there was like a crisis, and if you remained alive, a lot of people developed all kinds of sicknesses with their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="163">Even I have a complication of the inflammation of the veins on both legs. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I was sick for about six weeks during the wintertime after that. </sentence><sentence id="165">And thank God I escaped and I came through. </sentence><sentence id="166">Doctors didn't have any medications. " </sentence><sentence id="167">The only medication," he says, "I could give you is pray. </sentence><sentence id="168">Pray to God. </sentence><sentence id="169">I have nothing to give you. </sentence><sentence id="170">If you are strong, if you have a strong heart, you'll be able to live." </sentence><sentence id="171">And that advice, what can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="172">Thank God I came through it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: The Moravian Jews were about 1,500, and we were about 1,000, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="228">We were mixed up, we were partly from our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, . </sentence><sentence id="229">We had quite a few people, we have some people from <span class="populated place">Sojava</span> (ph) . </sentence><sentence id="230">We had some people from . </sentence><sentence id="231">And that was  They had a lot of tobacco. </sentence><sentence id="232">And there they lined us up, and we were all young kids. </sentence><sentence id="233">There they lined us up after work, and they beat us. </sentence><sentence id="234">Gave us a tremendous beating. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Who beat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: The Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="246">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us. </sentence><sentence id="247">So we didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="248">We took the beating, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="249">And that went on for days. </sentence><sentence id="250">Every day, every day. </sentence><sentence id="251">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins. </sentence><sentence id="252">You know, we had identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="253">To bring the bulletins into the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="255">So I said, "I have to go." </sentence><sentence id="256">My mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="257">She said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="258">Whatever will happen will happen." </sentence><sentence id="259">I said, "Look, I must go." </sentence><sentence id="260">So I went, that was late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="261">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a <span class="dlf">circle</span> to their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="262">That was the Romanians, and they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="263">They hit us with daggers. </sentence><sentence id="264">Then they sent us down to go to <span class="populated place">Mogilev</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our <span class="populated place">town</span>, from <span class="populated place">Jelenia</span> (ph) , from <span class="populated place">Shagala</span> (ph), from whatever <span class="populated place">town</span>, whatever they had there. </sentence><sentence id="266">And they were going to send us away to <span class="populated place">Gruenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">Then from <span class="populated place">Gruenwald</span>, to send us away to the Germans, specifically to <span class="populated place">Nikolayev</span> to build a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back. </sentence><sentence id="269">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a <span class="dlf">yard</span> surrounded by <span class="dlf">fences</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">Somehow my luck was that I saw an <span class="dlf">opening</span> in the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and I jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I went back to <span class="populated place">Mogilev</span>, but they didn't know -- they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="272">They did not have any notification that I left when I came. </sentence><sentence id="273">And that was the only thing that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="274">I had cousins, Thad an uncle that went there, did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="275">They never came. </sentence><sentence id="276">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick. </sentence><sentence id="277">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="278">And that was the end of that little incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Then you stay in <span class="populated place">Czernowitz</span> or did you go back to 2  that nobody should go in because it's very infectious. </sentence><sentence id="358">And at that time, I would say, 15 to 20 percent of population died. </sentence><sentence id="359">And you could not bury them because it was too cold, the <span class="env feature">ground</span> was frozen. </sentence><sentence id="360">So what they did is they took up the people in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, and they dumped them on the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">They left -- and the bodies remained there till the springtime. </sentence><sentence id="362">In the spring, they made <span class="dlf">graves</span> for a hundred people or 200 people, when the government took over. </sentence><sentence id="363">The <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> that went around taking together the bodies where they have people running around with <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> just taking together the bodies, that was the most -- how should I describe it? </sentence><sentence id="364">The most painful picture, when people were worse than animals. </sentence><sentence id="365">They take care of animals, but they didn't take care of people. </sentence><sentence id="366">And thank God we survived. </sentence><sentence id="367">Thank God we came out from our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">We had about -- from the population, we had about 60 percent that died, that had died or killed, that did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="369">In <span class="populated place">Bucovina</span>, we had about 500,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="370">From those 500,000 Jews, 60 percent died or were done away with. </sentence><sentence id="371">The rest came back. </sentence><sentence id="372">After we went some of them came here. </sentence><sentence id="373">Very few came here. </sentence><sentence id="374">The   </sentence></p></dialogue>
