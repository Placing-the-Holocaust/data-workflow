</sentence><sentence id="215">Did you see that boy?" </sentence><sentence id="216">And I knew that he is dead, but how can you say that to somebody? </sentence><sentence id="217">That maybe they took him away and he's going to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">But it was a frightening situation. </sentence><sentence id="219">The life in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> proper was a -- you were living with hope. </sentence><sentence id="220">I personally am an optimist. </sentence><sentence id="221">With every day that passed, I said maybe God will help. </sentence><sentence id="222">Maybe something will come of it, and maybe somehow we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="223">But during the wintertime, we suffered tremendously because during the wintertime, you had the sickness. </sentence><sentence id="224">Typhoid fever with spots, that was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="225">It took about two weeks if a person got sick with that sickness. </sentence><sentence id="226">Which I was sick with it, I was sick for two weeks with about 104 temperature, 105. </sentence><sentence id="227">And then there was like a crisis, and if you remained alive, a lot of people developed all kinds of sicknesses with their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="228">Even I have a complication of the inflammation of the veins on both legs. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I was sick for about six weeks during the wintertime after that. </sentence><sentence id="230">And thank God I escaped and I came through. </sentence><sentence id="231">Doctors didn't have any medications. " </sentence><sentence id="232">The only medication," he says, "I could give you is pray. </sentence><sentence id="233">Pray to God. </sentence><sentence id="234">I have nothing to give you. </sentence><sentence id="235">If you are strong, if you have a strong heart, you'll be able to live." </sentence><sentence id="236">And that advice, what can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="237">Thank God I came through it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Who beat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: The Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="325">We could not go to complain to the Romanians, because if we will complain, then the authorities, the Ukrainian authorities, which were very anti-Semitic, would kill us. </sentence><sentence id="326">So we didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="327">We took the beating, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="328">And that went on for days. </sentence><sentence id="329">Every day, every day. </sentence><sentence id="330">Another bad incident that I came through was they asked us one day to bring our bulletins. </sentence><sentence id="331">You know, we had identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="332">To bring the bulletins into the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">Anybody that is not bringing in, is not coming in with a bulletin to be signed by the authorities will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="334">So I said, "I have to go." </sentence><sentence id="335">My mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="336">She said, "Don't go. </sentence><sentence id="337">Whatever will happen will happen." </sentence><sentence id="338">I said, "Look, I must go." </sentence><sentence id="339">So I went, that was late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="340">And as soon as they got them, about 500, 600 people they made a <span class="dlf">circle</span> to their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="341">That was the Romanians, and they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="342">They hit us with daggers. </sentence><sentence id="343">Then they sent us down to go to <span class="populated place">Mogilev</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">When we came there, there was about 2,500 people gathered together from our <span class="populated place">town</span>, from <span class="populated place">Jelenia</span> (ph) , from <span class="populated place">Shagala</span> (ph), from whatever <span class="populated place">town</span>, whatever they had there. </sentence><sentence id="345">And they were going to send us away to <span class="populated place">Gruenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">Then from <span class="populated place">Gruenwald</span>, to send us away to the Germans, specifically to <span class="populated place">Nikolayev</span> to build a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">And we knew that any person that went there from before never came back. </sentence><sentence id="348">So what I did is plainly, we were all sitting in a <span class="dlf">yard</span> surrounded by <span class="dlf">fences</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">Somehow my luck was that I saw an <span class="dlf">opening</span> in the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and I jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I went back to <span class="populated place">Mogilev</span>, but they didn't know -- they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="351">They did not have any notification that I left when I came. </sentence><sentence id="352">And that was the only thing that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="353">I had cousins, Thad an uncle that went there, did not come back. </sentence><sentence id="354">They never came. </sentence><sentence id="355">Because you had to -- with the type of food that they gave you, you got sick. </sentence><sentence id="356">And after you got sick, the Germans shot you because they were very much afraid of having sick people, they feed their soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="357">And that was the end of that little incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: How long did you stay in <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
