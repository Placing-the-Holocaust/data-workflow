<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: From -- we knew that there were Jews who were passing from <span class="country">Greece</span> on their way to <span class="country">Palestine</span> or other places. </sentence><sentence id="66">And I remember in 1938 a friend of my father told him that in case of need, I would like you to change your identity and you and your family go to the <span class="building">house</span> of my father in a remote <span class="populated place">mountain village</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Well, at that time seeing what it was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and seeing that we had a fascist dictatorship in <span class="country">Greece</span>, everything was possible, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was when I was going to the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to the <span class="dlf">staging point</span> quite early, we had to wait and I didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="82">So I told the teacher why are we waiting, and other <span class="building">schools</span> have come after us and they pass. </sentence><sentence id="83">And the teacher, who happened This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="84">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="85"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to be a Christian, said we are the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, that's why we have to wait. </sentence><sentence id="86">So I realized that being a Jew was not a good thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did that bother you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: There were very few Jews in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: That's correct, there were only 40 Jews in <span class="populated place">Agrinio</span>, while there were almost 2000 in <span class="populated place">Ioannina</span>, so there was a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="110"><span class="populated place">Agrinio</span> was called also <span class="building">Vrahori</span>, or <span class="building">Evraiohori</span>, which means a <span class="populated place">Jewish village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">Why? </sentence><sentence id="112">Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in <span class="populated place">Agrinio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">And what happened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="114">I counted in the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses. </sentence><sentence id="115">And in my experience, I know of 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not. </sentence><sentence id="116">But still the numbers are very small. </sentence><sentence id="117">And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great. </sentence><sentence id="118">89 percent were transported outside of <span class="country">Greece</span> and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="119">So what happened in 1821 was a very little known historic event. </sentence><sentence id="120">The Turks killed in <span class="populated place">Istanbul</span> the Greek patriarch of <span class="populated place">Constantinople</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the <span class="env feature">sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">When this became known to what was then <span class="country">Greece</span>, and at that time <span class="country">Greece</span> was much smaller This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="123">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="124"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection than it is now, the 5000 Jews of <span class="country">Greece</span> were massacred. </sentence><sentence id="125">A few who survived were converted to Christianity. </sentence><sentence id="126">One of the leaders of the <span class="country">Greek nation</span>, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous Gentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Tripolitsa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">The anti- Jewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12 Jews hidden in his <span class="building">house</span> for three years. </sentence><sentence id="128">And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to the <span class="region">Ionian Island</span> of <span class="populated place">Zakinthos</span> which it was not then under Greek control. </sentence><sentence id="129">So, going back to <span class="populated place">Agrinio</span> and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from <span class="populated place">Arta</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">There were many small <span class="building">merchants</span> and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of the resistance in our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">His name was Yunas Munis. </sentence><sentence id="132">I would say about <span class="populated place">Agrinio</span> that <span class="populated place">Agrinio</span> has the distinct honor of being possibly the only <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="region">German occupied Europe</span> where all the Jews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I really can't think of any other <span class="populated place">city</span> where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that we did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in <span class="country">Greece</span> the rabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally incapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Did you -- did you move to <span class="populated place">Agrinion</span> before the Italians attacked <span class="country">Greece</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: That -- that -- that's correct, the -- we moved in <span class="populated place">Agrinion</span> sometime in March of 1940, and yeah, <span class="country">Italy</span> attacked <span class="country">Greece</span> on October 28", 1940. </sentence><sentence id="164">About this war I would like to say that the Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great. </sentence><sentence id="165">Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the army, and that included my father and many of my relatives. </sentence><sentence id="166">Over 500 were killed, including a cousin of my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="167">Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our relatives. </sentence><sentence id="168">To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who served with the British expeditionary force. </sentence><sentence id="169">And one of them was the father of the former Prime This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="171"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Minister of <span class="country">Israel</span>, Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he became a partisan of ELAS. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek Jewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the allies their first victory of the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="186">Mordechai Frizis was killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: I don't know when this happened, you joined a <span class="building">national youth organization</span> that was actually a fascist organization -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Ah, yes, that -- that's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: -- can you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: -- that's quite -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: -- talk about that some? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: -- yes. </sentence><sentence id="196">In <span class="populated place">Agrinion</span> we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I'm grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a member of the youth -- the fascist youth organization. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I'm grateful to them for not knowing that Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join them. </sentence><sentence id="199">I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Because I never liked to be discriminated against. </sentence><sentence id="207">So being a fascist suit me fine, although I did not realize that it was so bad at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: And what were you doing in the <span class="building">organization</span>? </sentence><sentence id="209">O -- th-they obviously didn't talk about Jews or do racial things, did they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="212"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="213">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="214"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: No, no, they -- they did not. </sentence><sentence id="216">They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures about Greek nationalism. </sentence><sentence id="217">Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you know, about th-this organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: So you were about 10 years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: And how long were you in that group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Until October 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: So when the Italians attacked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Yes, then the <span class="building">school</span> actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without realizing what the war meant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: So <span class="building">school</span> closed in October -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: -- or November. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other <span class="building">buildings</span>, some <span class="building">warehouses</span>, because the <span class="building">school buildings</span> were used as <span class="building">hospitals</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: So did you then go back to <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And with the same teachers and the same kids? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Yes, everything the same. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the <span class="building">high school</span>, the Italians did not kick out the Jewish students? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: The Italians? </sentence><sentence id="250">F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28", but the -- and the Germans attacked in April of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="251">Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="252">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="253"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection second, came. </sentence><sentence id="254">The Italians were excellent in <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">While in <span class="country">Italy</span> the 50,000 Jews lost their civil rights in 1938 with Mussolini's Aryan manif -- manifesto, in <span class="country">Greece</span>, thanks to the Italian commander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties. </sentence><sentence id="256">The -- we were able to -- to go to -- to the -- to <span class="building">school</span>, while the Italians were not able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="257">Actually there were 94 Italian university professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish generals who were dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="258">But in <span class="country">Greece</span> we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to cooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="259">So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the <span class="region">Italian zone</span>, business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies which a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to <span class="building">partisan hospitals</span>, once the partisan movement became stronger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="276">And there -- there was one moment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they registered, and I know of only one person from <span class="populated place">Preveza</span> who did not trust the Italians, only one. </sentence><sentence id="277">And he took his parents and went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="278">Th-That's how he survived later on the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="279">But we registered. </sentence><sentence id="280">And -- I'm ashamed to say that. </sentence><sentence id="281">And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini made a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to <span class="populated place">camps</span> in the <span class="region">Ionian Islands</span> and <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">But of course, you know, <span class="country">Italy</span> capitulated and this did not happen, but the Germans came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: You know, you wrote in your book that you, at first the family, it seemed, had hoped that the Germans would occupy rather than the Italians because you thought they would be better. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: That's another unfortunate kind of thinking in <span class="country">Greece</span>, but remember that in <span class="country">Greece</span> at least 30 to 40 percent of population were pro-German. </sentence><sentence id="300">That's a significant number. </sentence><sentence id="301">And because the -- the Greeks defeated the Italians in <span class="country">Albania</span>, we were afraid that the Italians might come there and be vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually did not find significant resistance because many Greek generals were pro-German. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: So you were surprised? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way. </sentence><sentence id="305">I have to say that the Germans behaved very well too, when they entered our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: And they entered your <span class="region">area</span> in April of nin -- deg43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="311">Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- 41. </sentence><sentence id="312">Only in <span class="populated place">Salonica</span> they did not behave well, but in our <span class="region">area</span> they passed through and they did not bother anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: But your -- your <span class="region">area</span> was the <span class="region">Italian zone</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: [happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in <span class="populated place">Ioannina</span> when the Germans came in first. </sentence><sentence id="319">And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply passed. </sentence><sentence id="320">And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: So you moved back from <span class="populated place">Agrinion</span> to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Yes, from -- from <span class="populated place">Ioannina</span>, once my father became a civilian again, we moved to <span class="populated place">Agrini</span>, and my father went back to his <span class="building">bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">In other words, the Germans passed through <span class="populated place">Ioannina</span> -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: In <span class="populated place">741</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: In "41, and since this was the <span class="region">Italian zone</span> of occupation, they did not stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: The Italians were in charge until September of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="334">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="335">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="336"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="796">The -- the situation was such that although the German intentions towards the Jews of <span class="populated place">Salonica</span> proved to be bad from the beginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til February 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones of occupation and go to the <span class="region">Italian zone</span>, where the Italians were living very well as I told you before. </sentence><sentence id="797">The remaining Jews in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> and <span class="country">Macedonia</span>, and that's where the great majority of the Jews were, they did not know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="798">I feel they were like children who needed
