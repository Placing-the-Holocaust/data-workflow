<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1927">Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1929">A: About two weeks after we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they lined up, had another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1930">They took us to the <span class="interior space">showers</span>, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. </sentence><sentence id="1932">The <span class="spatial object">tank top</span> was so short, I had a ribbon in the <span class="spatial object">tank top</span> and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing. </sentence><sentence id="1933">And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out. </sentence><sentence id="1934">Then something happened, the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were not there, and they put us in some temporary <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1935">The following day, they ran another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1936">They gave us a <span class="interior space">bath</span>, and they put us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1937">This was the time I really don't know if <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> had two <span class="building">stations</span> or not because this is the only time and I went back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I remember, we went through the main <span class="populated place">camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, because we were in and this was, I saw the red <span class="building">buildings</span>, the permanent <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1938">I saw the band playing. </sentence><sentence id="1939">So, I had a feeling they had some other <span class="building">station</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> proper which they loaded us. </sentence><sentence id="1940">They unloaded the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> somewhere else, and they put us there. </sentence><sentence id="1941">They put us in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1942">They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1943">There was one <span class="spatial object">water bucket</span> with water, and there was one <span class="spatial object">slop bucket</span>, and they put us on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1944">I think we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped somewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute the water. </sentence><sentence id="1945">Brought a little <span class="spatial object">cup</span> and we were supposed to have a sip. </sentence><sentence id="1946">One woman got so frenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe. </sentence><sentence id="1947">When they give us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles. </sentence><sentence id="1948">One was white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin, significant later, I'll tell you about that story. </sentence><sentence id="1949">We stayed, and as I said the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was on and off and on and off. </sentence><sentence id="1950">At night it would stop. </sentence><sentence id="1951">I remember once we were next <span class="region">side</span> there were real cattle making cattle noises. </sentence><sentence id="1952">This was an absolute nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Later on when I had my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="1954">That's all I could hear is that. </sentence><sentence id="1955">It took me years before I wanted to take a <span class="spatial object">train</span> anyplace, because even when I was in <span class="country">Europe</span> and we traveled later, I was very reluctant to take a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1956">We finally arrived at <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> about maybe the third day. </sentence><sentence id="1957">All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, <span class="populated place">Dresden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1958">We saw someone tried to  climb up. </sentence><sentence id="1959">We could see the bombed out <span class="populated place">cities</span> and we were very happy to see those bombed out <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1960">I think it must have been the third day. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We felt that another night on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="1962">We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing. </sentence><sentence id="1963">Anyway, they took us, we came to <span class="populated place">Bergen- Belsen</span>, and until that time <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> was not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1964">They had various <span class="populated place">camps</span> of various entities, <span class="populated place">prisoner of war camp</span>, but there was no <span class="populated place">camp concentration camp</span> as such. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. </sentence><sentence id="1966">Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1967">She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="1968">We finally got into the main <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1969">It was a long, long <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1970">The front of the <span class="dlf">street</span>, the beginning of the <span class="dlf">street</span>, there was administration places, there was a <span class="interior space">bath</span>, there was a little <span class="building">crematorium</span> which they could burn two bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1971">But this was done for bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1972">It was never done to use it for killing people. </sentence><sentence id="1973">If people died, they would use it. </sentence><sentence id="1974">They gave us a <span class="interior space">bath</span> and we put our clothes in a little <span class="spatial object">basket</span>, and when we walked out from the other side of the <span class="interior space">bath</span>, we got the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1975">They marched us down to the end of the <span class="dlf">street</span> of the <span class="populated place">town</span>, the very end of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and there was this big <span class="building">tent</span> that could accommodate about 1,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1976">It was clean. </sentence><sentence id="1977">We all got a blanket each. </sentence><sentence id="1978">On the <span class="interior space">floor</span> of the <span class="building">tent</span> was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. </sentence><sentence id="1979">There as a <span class="spatial object">latrine</span> in the back right under the <span class="building">guards tower</span>, big <span class="dlf">pits</span> and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1980">There was a wooden trough with pipe. </sentence><sentence id="1981">We could use the <span class="env feature">water</span> any time we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1982">They nominated one lady, she was from <span class="country">Germany</span>, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from <span class="country">Germany</span>, so they spoke fluently German. </sentence><sentence id="1983">They counted us once a day. </sentence><sentence id="1984">This <span class="populated place">camp</span> is located on the , SO it's like heather. </sentence><sentence id="1985">At that time there was <span class="dlf">fields</span> in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was just us and the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1986">So, we could sit in the <span class="env feature">sun</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1987">We could drink when we wanted, we could go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> when we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1988">Even at night, if you wanted to go to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, -- if the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he heard a movement. </sentence><sentence id="1989">So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1990">When the girls were sitting there, they would just look. </sentence><sentence id="1991">After a while, you lose all inhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look. </sentence><sentence id="1992">That's what we're going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1993">At that time we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big <span class="spatial object">chest</span> with some first aid things and some pills, some equipment. </sentence><sentence id="1994">Mom became the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1995">There was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very, very decent guy. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So, one of the first questions he asked me is "How come your head is shaved?" </sentence><sentence id="1997">They couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1998">There were SS but they had no idea about the horrors of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or the other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1999">They were just half way decent people in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2000">The food we got was paradise next to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2001">Fairly decent soup, we got some kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they had something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd get red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the first few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2002">The next few days they put another <span class="building">tent</span> up. </sentence><sentence id="2003">We got a big group of  Hungarian women another <span class="building">tent</span> up. </sentence><sentence id="2004">So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that <span class="building">compound</span>, because there were other groups.

You had to use ; the one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of that cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to spread further and maybe we could save. </sentence><sentence id="2507">The oldest one, there was no way of saving. </sentence><sentence id="2508">She was, for all practical -- maybe here in the <span class="country">United States</span> with heavy doses of vitamins and heavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="2509">But certainly you couldn't save her. </sentence><sentence id="2510">This was what we had to do. </sentence><sentence id="2511">There was another thing which later came up, much later. </sentence><sentence id="2512">A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would get bigger and bigger and bigger. </sentence><sentence id="2513">Unless that blister was opened and drained very often half of the body was covered with the blister. </sentence><sentence id="2514">What did this? </sentence><sentence id="2515">I don't know, because I'll tell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to do with it, because they had no idea what to do with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2533">Q: How did you figure it out? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2534">A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if it wasn't too advanced case of it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2535">Q: Did you have enough supplies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2537">A: No, I'll tell you about that later. </sentence><sentence id="2538">Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw. </sentence><sentence id="2539">A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed. </sentence><sentence id="2540">It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2541">What do you have. </sentence><sentence id="2542">See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2543">When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2544">You had to hand him that while he was on the run. </sentence><sentence id="2545">He was awful, screaming, yelling. </sentence><sentence id="2546">Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2547">He decided he is going to operate. </sentence><sentence id="2548">Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat. </sentence><sentence id="2549">We set up the surgery in the <span class="building">dental office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2550">He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. </sentence><sentence id="2551">It was raining. </sentence><sentence id="2552">It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2553">He assigned my mother to the anesthesia. </sentence><sentence id="2554">She was his favorite anesthetist. </sentence><sentence id="2555">The anesthesia consisted of a little <span class="spatial object">mask</span>, a little <span class="interior space">cage</span> that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2556">No other support, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2557">Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2558">He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2559">He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out. </sentence><sentence id="2560">This was the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2561">It looks like a <span class="env feature">fish bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2562">He poked around. </sentence><sentence id="2563">He decided he can't find the appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2564">He took all the intestines out. </sentence><sentence id="2565">And the conditions are not sterile exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it. </sentence><sentence id="2567">Put everything back together, took everything out again. </sentence><sentence id="2568">He still can't find her appendix. </sentence><sentence id="2569">At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring <span class="populated place">Alenluf</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2570">Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main <span class="building">compound</span> or where he was, but he was in the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span>, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="2571">Well, a guy went on the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. </sentence><sentence id="2572">In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2573">I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. </sentence><sentence id="2574">That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="2575">Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up. </sentence><sentence id="2576">She developed peritonitis. </sentence><sentence id="2577">For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in. </sentence><sentence id="2578">He sent morphine. </sentence><sentence id="2579">He sent painkillers. </sentence><sentence id="2580">He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. </sentence><sentence id="2581">It lasted three days, and she died. </sentence><sentence id="2582">But this was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="2583">And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and back into the <span class="interior space">cavity</span> and back on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and back in the <span class="interior space">cavity</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2584">It was a horror. </sentence><sentence id="2585">And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2586">You can't react. </sentence><sentence id="2587">And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2588">He just did his job and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2589">This was one of the worst things which I witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="2590">Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. </sentence><sentence id="2591">We had a bunch of  syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2592">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something. </sentence><sentence id="2593">We also had babies. </sentence><sentence id="2594">There were babies born. </sentence><sentence id="2595">We had one woman once who knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span> in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to the <span class="building">tower</span> and said, look we have a woman in labor. </sentence><sentence id="2596">None of us is a midwife. </sentence><sentence id="2597">So, they came in. </sentence><sentence id="2598">The two guys, and they went from <span class="building">barrack</span> to <span class="building">barrack</span> and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="2599">I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> over there and he said this is <span class="env feature">River Jordan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2600">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive. </sentence><sentence id="2601">But, they didn't take away the babies. </sentence><sentence id="2602">They didn't kill the babies. </sentence><sentence id="2603">They didn't do any harm to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2675">Q: Were they <span class="populated place">family camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2677">A: That was later that we got into. </sentence><sentence id="2678">At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few of them and those slovak women who had their children with them. </sentence><sentence id="2679">Anyway, one day I needed my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going, and I said, "Would you let me do the syringes here?" </sentence><sentence id="2680">She said, "Oh, you're so busy. </sentence><sentence id="2681">Why don't you let me do it. </sentence><sentence id="2682">I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it." </sentence><sentence id="2683">I said "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="2684">I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2685">She burnt every one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Now, this could be considered sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="2687">I mean you know you had to really be so careful because here you are burning eight <span class="spatial object">syringes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2688">I was beside myself. </sentence><sentence id="2689">I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them an injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2690">Well, I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2691">Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from <span class="region">Northern Poland</span> originally, and we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="2692">I told him what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2693">I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and they burned it and they didn't pay attention. </sentence><sentence id="2694">He started bringing, the same day he came in the afternoon, he brought one syringe. </sentence><sentence id="2695">Whether he stole them, how he got them within a week I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me. </sentence><sentence id="2696">He never said anything to <span class="populated place">Schnabble</span>, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2697">So, even in those conditions there were people who were a little compassionate. </sentence><sentence id="2698">By that time things were getting bad, more <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2699">I believe this was the time they brought the commandant from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and he was cruel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2723">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2725">A: I think Horss. </sentence><sentence id="2726">And that she's the head and she was blonde and some others. </sentence><sentence id="2727">I mean this nasty crew from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> came. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2728">Q: Do you know about what time, what year that was? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2729">A: This was in "44, had to be around winter of "44, because it was getting cold when we lived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, when we had those surgeries. </sentence><sentence id="2730">Also, when they were bringing the soups to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the soups, the <span class="spatial object">kettles</span>, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who brought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. </sentence><sentence id="2731">We needed them for the patients. </sentence><sentence id="2732">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were going to move all of our patients, and the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> first, on the other side of main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2733">This was originally a <span class="populated place">prisoner of war camp</span>, and they had some permanent <span class="building">buildings</span> which were <span class="building">hospital buildings</span>, and they moved first the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then they moved the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2734">Our group was assigned to main <span class="building">building</span> number one. </sentence><sentence id="2735">It had an <span class="interior space">operating room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2736">It had a <span class="building">dental office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2737">It had some <span class="dlf">wards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2738">We had like an <span class="interior space">outpatient room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2739">So, the first order of business was that the <span class="interior space">operating room</span> had white tile floors and <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2740">So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the commandant wanted that for his <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2741">I believe we had electricity. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I can't even remember. </sentence><sentence id="2743">They must have had electricity because my mother had this <span class="spatial object">sterilizer</span> that was an electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the <span class="spatial object">instruments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2744">The <span class="building">dental office</span> was so beautifully equipped that when the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> would come in an examine the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="2745">No x-rays, but everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2746">There was enough novocain that we were afraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. </sentence><sentence id="2747">Then there must have been a <span class="interior space">room</span> for the nurses, and then there was <span class="interior space">room</span> where the doctors lived and Mom took me with her and I shared a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> with her because they wouldn't give me a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2748">I was a nurse and they wouldn't give me a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2769">Q: So, all along you were living in the <span class="building">hospital</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2771">A: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="2772">And that <span class="interior space">room</span> was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the administrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian dentist, Larissa. </sentence><sentence id="2773">One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day Adventist, was German, they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2774">She came down with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="2775">This was much later, so she was put in with the doctors in that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2776">That was his orders that she should be kept in that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2777">We had one <span class="interior space">surgical ward</span> where people had all kinds of wounds, surgical wounds. </sentence><sentence id="2778">Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little supplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in the <span class="building">outpatient clinic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2779">I very seldom worked the <span class="dlf">wards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2780">I did very well with the outpatients in whatever had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="2781">Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the dressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. </sentence><sentence id="2782">This was stinky, festering thing and we didn't have enough bandages. </sentence><sentence id="2783">We didn't get them enough. </sentence><sentence id="2784">We couldn't change them every day. </sentence><sentence id="2785">Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and there was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the wounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. </sentence><sentence id="2786">This  was the main <span class="building">hospital building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2787">The next one was the nicest <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2788">That's where the children were. </sentence><sentence id="2789">By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to the parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an <span class="building">orphanage</span> there, and the Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the babies were alive, they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="2790">That's were Doctor lived. </sentence><sentence id="2791">That place was heated. </sentence><sentence id="2792">They gave them some food. </sentence><sentence id="2793">They were getting the white soup for the children. </sentence><sentence id="2794">They were getting the white bread, and I have a feeling they must have inoculated the children for typhus, because I was not aware of many of them having typhus fever. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I know they were inoculating people because at one time Binko and I and another nurse went to one of the <span class="populated place">subcamps</span> or whatever and those people had passports from <span class="country">Argentina</span>, from <span class="country">Brazil</span> from <span class="country">Australia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2796">Whether they were real passports, whether they were false passports, we don't know because many of them were Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2797">But we went out there when the epidemic started and we were inoculating the whole group there. </sentence><sentence id="2798">Then there were two other <span class="building">barracks</span> where one was not so bad and then there was one which was worse condition and then there was one number 5 where I think there were 500 people dead and 100 dead every day. </sentence><sentence id="2799">They would bring the people -- they would just bring them in blankets and leave them there. </sentence><sentence id="2800">I mean, people who were in the different <span class="building">barracks</span> would just bring them in the blankets, and if there was any hope for them, they were separated and put somewhere else, but those were people like in a <span class="building">hospice</span>, they were just dying there. </sentence><sentence id="2801">I was very friendly with the head nurse and she had she used to say to me after I had typhus fever come and I'll give you some bread because they didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="2802">She would get and she had a count of 500 so she got 500 pieces of bread according to the count. </sentence><sentence id="2803">She said, they're not eating, and you may as well have another piece of bread and get some strength. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2837">Q: The dead people, they just dumped them outside? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2839">A: That I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2840">When we first came in there was a little <span class="interior space">morgue</span> not far from the <span class="building">hospital buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2841">A little <span class="building">concrete structure</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2842">Well we started taking the people out. </sentence><sentence id="2843">Everybody was taking them out. </sentence><sentence id="2844">Well, after a while that place would not accommodate the bodies and they didn't have time to take them. </sentence><sentence id="2845">It got to a point that it was like a tremendous <span class="dlf">field</span> of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw. </sentence><sentence id="2846">Families would walk by and look and who do I know there. </sentence><sentence id="2847">If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save the blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there. </sentence><sentence id="2848">The <span class="spatial object">pile</span> was growing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more <span class="interior space">room</span> and they had no -- they could not keep up with removing the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2849">Toward the end when there was this tremendous epidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of privileges. </sentence><sentence id="2850">They would dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and burn the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2851">They just could not keep up with it. </sentence><sentence id="2852">When the British liberated the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> took the British General, whoever it was, showing the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> and naturally they avoided that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2853">So, there was a bunch of noisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here. </sentence><sentence id="2854">We didn't speak English, but they said you have to see this place. </sentence><sentence id="2855">And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and they made the German officers remove those bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2856">They came so beautiful the first day. </sentence><sentence id="2857">They came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had  to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2859">This was horrid. </sentence><sentence id="2860">Anyway, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was getting bigger. </sentence><sentence id="2861">There were <span class="spatial object">transports</span> coming in every few days, and they needed help with the <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2862">When the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> came in, the able bodies would get a <span class="interior space">shower</span> and they would place them in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. </sentence><sentence id="2863">A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="2864">I have to help them. </sentence><sentence id="2865">I just can't let them work both nights." </sentence><sentence id="2866">So, we went out. </sentence><sentence id="2867">By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. </sentence><sentence id="2868">There was this big <span class="interior space">room</span> with all kinds of <span class="spatial object">bundles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2869">They made the people leave the <span class="spatial object">bundles</span> and there were sick people. </sentence><sentence id="2870">Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2871">There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out. </sentence><sentence id="2872">She's half dead, she's dead." </sentence><sentence id="2873">I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. </sentence><sentence id="2874">Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out. </sentence><sentence id="2875">Let's take her out. </sentence><sentence id="2876">Let the guys take her out." </sentence><sentence id="2877">So, I was hiding her behind <span class="spatial object">bundles</span>, behind anything. </sentence><sentence id="2878">Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face. </sentence><sentence id="2879">I tried to give her some <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2880">Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out. </sentence><sentence id="2881">That <span class="spatial

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2957">A: We never showered. </sentence><sentence id="2958">The first time when they brought you to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2959">This was the second one. </sentence><sentence id="2960">Maybe once they took us out. </sentence><sentence id="2961">I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2962">Q: So, you never washed? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: Well, we washed. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Maybe once they took us to <span class="spatial object">shower</span>, maybe when we're changing <span class="populated place">camps</span>, I think they marched us. </sentence><sentence id="2965">This was a pleasure, this <span class="interior space">shower</span>, and they took our clothes and they deloused them. </sentence><sentence id="2966">Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. </sentence><sentence id="2967">I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it. </sentence><sentence id="2968">At first they didn't know what was wrong with me. </sentence><sentence id="2969">So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. </sentence><sentence id="2970">We had a young doctor who was wounded at the <span class="region">Russian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2971">His arm was injured and he was working in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2972">They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. </sentence><sentence id="2973">By that time, the doctors in the <span class="interior space">room</span> that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the <span class="interior space">ward</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2974">But I had my own <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine. </sentence><sentence id="2975">She had t.b. </sentence><sentence id="2976">but I tried to keep her on calcium. </sentence><sentence id="2977">The theory was that calcium was good for t.b. </sentence><sentence id="2978">and we had calcium, she would get it. </sentence><sentence id="2979">Again, she was a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="2980">You tried to help people who were not too far gone. </sentence><sentence id="2981">We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. </sentence><sentence id="2982">By that time, the epidemic started. </sentence><sentence id="2983">The typhus epidemic. </sentence><sentence id="2984">It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. </sentence><sentence id="2985">My fever was building up about three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2986">It's like with pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="2987">It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis. </sentence><sentence id="2988">Well, Mom would warm up water in the <span class="spatial object">sterilizer</span> and wash me and bring water and wet my lips. </sentence><sentence id="2989">And those Slovak ladies made me a little <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2990">I'll never forget it. </sentence><sentence id="2991">This tiny little <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2992">They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And I kept on saying "Get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="spatial object">train</span> out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="2994">I can't stand the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2995">And when they would bring the turnip soup into the <span class="interior

<span class="dlf">door</span> and said "Get me my mother." </sentence><sentence id="2998">So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies. </sentence><sentence id="2999">We had something to support the <span class="spatial object">heart</span>, just a <span class="spatial object">stimulator heart</span>, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3000">I think I was dying. </sentence><sentence id="3001">Then I got better. </sentence><sentence id="3002">In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors. </sentence><sentence id="3003">I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="3004">This young German doctor performed some surgeries. </sentence><sentence id="3005">Again, he wanted to learn. </sentence><sentence id="3006">He did them in the <span class="interior space">operating room</span> under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him. </sentence><sentence id="3007">Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="3008">Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="3009">He didn't know where he was going. </sentence><sentence id="3010">So, they did perform some surgeries on those people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3059">Q: So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3061">A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. </sentence><sentence id="3062">I mean  they never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor and maybe he should learn. </sentence><sentence id="3063">And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the <span class="building">dental office</span> most of the day. </sentence><sentence id="3064">He also had some massages done. </sentence><sentence id="3065">First one masseuse and then the other friend of mine, the one who was the head of that very <span class="interior space">sick ward</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3066">She would come in because he needed physical therapy on his arm. </sentence><sentence id="3067">The first time we had the inkling that things were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="3068">The Russians are so and so many kilometers from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and they were afraid of Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3069">My mother overheard a conversation. </sentence><sentence id="3070">Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about her working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. </sentence><sentence id="3071">By the time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. </sentence><sentence id="3072">There was a raging epidemic of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3073">There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. </sentence><sentence id="3074">One day this other doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have water, I don't think we had bread. </sentence><sentence id="3075">He said times are very bad but you cannot abuse your patients, you have to take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="3076">He was trying to give us a pep talk how to take care of our patients. </sentence><sentence id="3077">How ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="3078">One day one of the guards -- I somehow suspected whether they were experimenting with our lives. </sentence><sentence id="3079">One day a young woman came in and she had a turban, a very tightly wrapped turban around her head and she said she's itching. </sentence><sentence id="3080">We took off the turban, her head was so covered with lice, like you see, you have a big <span class="env feature">ant hill</span> and you kick it apart and you see the ants coming out. </sentence><sentence id="3081">I'm talking about big <span class="env feature">ant hills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3082">I mean, you couldn't see the hair. </sentence><sentence id="3083">So, we cut it and put some disinfectant. </sentence><sentence id="3084">We had some anti-lice things, burned the hair outside, the whole thing, and I was wondering if by any chance if they did not decide that this is a fast way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="3085">Because they were all inoculated. </sentence><sentence id="3086">The Germans were all inoculated. </sentence><sentence id="3087">After the war, I think some of them got typhus, when they were handling the bodies, but they were very well isolated and inoculated. </sentence><sentence id="3088">Whether they tried this, I don't know because I don't know how anyone could have lived with that mess, and the way the turban was wrapped around her head, it was a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="3089">It was -- I've never seen anything like it. </sentence><sentence id="3090">I'm telling you you see a <span class="dlf">ant hill</span>, a big one, and this is what is creepy. </sentence><sentence id="3091">So, as I said, toward the end, there were so many sick people. </sentence><sentence id="3092">So many people dying, and you couldn't do a thing for them. </sentence><sentence id="3093">Yes, there was an effort to save them, every once in a while they had the surgeons that wanted to do something, but I don't think this was so much an effort to save them. </sentence><sentence id="3094">I have a feeling that this was an opportunity for the doctors to learn. </sentence><sentence id="3095">Schnabble was just learning whatever he wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="3096">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="3097">He disappeared. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="dlf">lines</span> every day. </sentence><sentence id="3302">As a matter of fact, after we were liberated they took everybody to <span class="populated place">Bergen</span>, but in the meantime the British helped us clean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the <span class="building">buildings</span>, and I stayed another month or so, maybe another few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3303">No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was still in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people and still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to <span class="populated place">Bergen</span>, which was a <span class="populated place">military camp</span>, and they placed them there. </sentence><sentence id="3304">The sick ones, they had a whole procedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. </sentence><sentence id="3305">They would take them in and they would bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads. </sentence><sentence id="3306">And they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in <span class="building">hospital barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3307">This was a very slow process. </sentence><sentence id="3308">In the meantime, people were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="3309">They needed help now, and by that time we had some supplies. </sentence><sentence id="3310">So, we were admitting some of them and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some bandages and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="3311">We had some medications. </sentence><sentence id="3312">If they had a headache, we could give them aspirin. </sentence><sentence id="3313">I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. </sentence><sentence id="3314">They were still getting typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3315">That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated and toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, like they did in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3316">There was a march. </sentence><sentence id="3317">There was a group that went on <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and I think the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. </sentence><sentence id="3318">Anyway, there was a rumor that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> is mine and they are going to evacuate the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and whoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the nurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and everything and they said, "Are you going to walk?" </sentence><sentence id="3319">I said, "No, I'm not leaving Mom, and she can't walk. </sentence><sentence id="3320">I'm staying no matter what happened." </sentence><sentence id="3321">Well, that night we had bombs and they bombed this was <span class="populated place">Lindenberg</span>, the Allies bombed a nearby <span class="populated place">town</span> and a day or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but they were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either get the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the <span class="interior space">baths</span>, the <span class="interior space">sauna</span> and our favorite the guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this <span class="interior space">sauna</span>, in the <span class="spatial object">furnace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3322">They were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3323">They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands, didn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook, a German cook in one of the <span class="interior space">kitchens</span>, and they were supposed to be working. </sentence><sentence id="3324">He said, I have another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3325">He killed a girl, wounded one, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. </sentence><sentence id="3326">By that time we were guarded by Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="3327">The guards were all released, outside guards. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And there  was a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="3329">This was a German, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3330">One of the girls was brought in. </sentence><sentence id="3331">She walked out, she said, "We are free. </sentence><sentence id="3332">We are liberated." </sentence><sentence id="3333">Bang, and she was gone. </sentence><sentence id="3334">What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April the <span class="spatial object">tank</span> went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. </sentence><sentence id="3335">Well, it was in the afternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3336">Then they discovered the bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="3337">Some of the girls were nuts. </sentence><sentence id="3338">They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting. </sentence><sentence id="3339">One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten and become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. </sentence><sentence id="3340">And the Germans were guarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. </sentence><sentence id="3341">There was a language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that she doesn't want to do any harm. </sentence><sentence id="3342">She just wants that German to eat that food, and he made him eat it.
