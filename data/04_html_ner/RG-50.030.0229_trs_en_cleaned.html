that how can people be back in this way and to live in this way, but I made a self-suggestion that it is now my shame. </sentence><sentence id="36">It the shame, it is the shame who made this with me. </sentence><sentence id="37">It was a brainwash but I made for me. </sentence><sentence id="38">I have a little uh story about in this <span class="building">office</span>...interesting.

</sentence><sentence id="45">We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first time, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I have flattened this <span class="building">house</span> what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the conceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag. </sentence><sentence id="46">I was quite apathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live. </sentence><sentence id="47">It is only a temporary thing. </sentence><sentence id="48">What will happen with us if it is not the place where we were living, and I went this young person. </sentence><sentence id="49">I went in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">He showed me which uh...attached there is two <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and the <span class="interior space">maid's room</span> and came out a person from the <span class="building">house</span>, a young man, good looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this <span class="building">house</span> and I thought I don't want to come in. </sentence><sentence id="51">I must come in. </sentence><sentence id="52">He thought come in...there was a good place. </sentence><sentence id="53">I have here a <span class="building">war

this <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">I come back and I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband... find a place. </sentence><sentence id="59">The main thing there is a particular person. </sentence><sentence id="60">He told me that the <span class="dlf">door</span> will be always open and there is a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, and this was very very important and we decided to change the <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">We left this our <span class="building">flat</span> with a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and something that was necessary to this <span class="building">flat</span> and we made a friendship with this uh <span class="building">factory</span> owner. </sentence><sentence id="62">He he immediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh <span class="building">war factory</span>. </sentence><sentence

eleven or...till one...something like this, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy. </sentence><sentence id="64">But the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military, military service. </sentence><sentence id="65">This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling outside in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and this was very important. </sentence><sentence id="66">So it was quite a, quite a good life. </sentence><sentence id="67">It was written...1 was luha person always I was looking the good side. </sentence><sentence id="68">Now we are in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">The other <span class="interior space">room</span> is took in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician

my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was living eight, nine, nine or ten person in this <span class="interior space">two-room flat</span>, but there was living. </sentence><sentence id="71">In uh during this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control. </sentence><sentence id="72">I am not a historian to to...and we had heard that the...in the... what happened in the <span class="region">countryside</span> everywhere and what was the meaning <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">That I think there was together and what the meaning deportation. </sentence><sentence id="74">Not exactly...only about. </sentence><sentence id="75">We didn't get any any detail how was this deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things. </sentence><sentence id="76">Always I I was looking what is deportation. </sentence><sentence id="77">To take the people another place to work. </sentence><sentence id="78">Maybe uncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine. </sentence><sentence id="79">But we have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">In the meantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement. </sentence><sentence id="81">I have heard sometimes from my husband that he is a Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="82">OK. </sentence><sentence id="83">It's his business, and he went always out from the <span class="building">house</span>...a lot of <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very interested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued this deportation from the <span class="country">country</span> and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn because this deportation, this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> together...put together the people and put in because  it came very very close to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, till the <span class="populated place">suburbs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">And it was a a feeling that tomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming. </sentence><sentence id="85">Then uh I think it may be August...we get some some information that what is stopped uh ____ you know, ...uh stopped the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="86">And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead. </sentence><sentence id="87">I didn't run to understand. </sentence><sentence id="88">My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going to . </sentence><sentence id="89">And I told you are crazy. </sentence><sentence id="90">You are speaking something what is believable. </sentence><sentence id="91"> about the the _, it must be something. </sentence><sentence id="92">We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh soldiers during our our stroll, but it was

id="300">We will see what will be tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="301">And this was our our way back to this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">In the meantime the population, there were people from the <span class="building">house</span> not happened anything and we went to sleep and the next day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier there was a round-up. </sentence><sentence id="303">In the <span class="building">house</span> two Nilos with a gun came in. </sentence><sentence id="304">Every man down to the <span

</sentence><sentence id="312">I told I told he is mentally ill. </sentence><sentence id="313">They told OK, remain at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization that beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several <span class="building">children home</span> and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about Zionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when will go a group out from <span class="country">Hungary</span> to <span class="country">Palestine</span> through <span class="country">Romania</span>, we are in this list. </sentence><sentence id="315">This was the whole what I had

</sentence><sentence id="317">We are...we get the permission to go in with the children and we can work there. </sentence><sentence id="318">And we went. </sentence><sentence id="319">And this was in the ...it was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto area</span>, so we  5 something from myself and I take my <span class="spatial

object">typewriter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">If I am working, I am working with my <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span> because I was not able to make any other work, so I took my <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span> and it was sitting there in an <span class="interior space">office room</span> like half from this. </sentence><sentence id="322">Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I, first time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion about uh when we are taking in in this <span class="building">home</span> the children, which way we will educate the children. </sentence><sentence id="323">Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence. </sentence><sentence id="324">I think it was absolute curious for me that while __--s Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference. </sentence><sentence id="325">What can be different they leftist or...we will... was absolute out from these ___ and my husband was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="326">He was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped. </sentence><sentence id="327">He was not speaking one word. </sentence><sentence id="328">I have seen on the face that something he was not satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="329">Later I learned that this was not the thing what was so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children. </sentence><sentence id="330">So the second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh some kind of <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>...<span class="spatial object">carriage</span> uh <span class="dlf">platform</span> (ph), two wheel and somebody was personally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war <span class="building">factory</span> and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again supplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...<span class="building">children home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to, how to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we can give place or what or which kind of children over. </sentence><sentence id="332">With this, in this time outside from this <span class="building">children home</span>, becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people didn't...certain <span class="region">area</span> what will what will be the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was already opened. </sentence><sentence id="333">The very old people must go in the in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">The people till uh sixty must go ina certain place like a horse racing uh <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">Women in another <span class="region">area</span> and there was a ina <span class="dlf">block</span> out on the

</sentence><sentence id="339">So it uh produced a lot of children without parents in these yellow-starred <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">Their mother went in this way, the father there and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the <span class="building">house</span> and not remained or hidden in the <span

parents. </sentence><sentence id="342">This was the _ first to make this <span class="building">children's home</span>, to bring in these children in a <span class="building">home</span> and this action made by Otto Komo (ph). </sentence><sentence id="343">Have you heard about <span class="building">Otto Komo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">He was the president of the Zionist uh

</sentence><sentence id="346">Later we  6 remember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife with two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was occupied in the <span

children. </sentence><sentence id="350">Must take out if somebody is in the age to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger child, what is the name. </sentence><sentence id="351">I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and I began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which <span class="building">house</span> they was coming in. </sentence><sentence id="352">If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , So this began to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the <span class="building">headquarter</span> from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the <span class="building">headquarter</span> was in the or . </sentence><sentence id="353">This was a very famous uh <span class="building">headquarter</span> for the  7 groups with the white band, they will remain in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, so it was a a mania to

new uh possibility that if somebody has a a shutzpass, what was a...how to say...a document that the certain person who has a a passport from a from a neutral <span class="country">country</span> or a collective passport or something like this, that he get a a document and this name became shutzpass. </sentence><sentence id="357">It is save saving passes, something to translate. </sentence><sentence id="358">The first <span class="spatial object">shutzpass</span> we have heard about from about <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span>, but this was a very elegant, very very noble shutzpass. </sentence><sentence id="359">We had heard only that the Swede con...uh <span class="building">embassy</span> is giving shutzpass for people who have relatives in <span

</sentence><sentence id="362">We was not thinking about to get uh near to Swedish because we hadn't had relatives, haven't had any connection with the...so the the <span class="building">Swiss

class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">This this group never was able to left <span class="country">Hungary</span> because uh in the meantime...this was, I think the beginning was August or what July...in the meantime <span class="country">Romania</span> made the...came out from the Axis uh not made but it surren...surrendered and uh there was no more possibility to to to make a way through from <span class="country">Hungary</span> through <span class="country">Romania</span> to to the <span class="env feature">seashore</span> to get a to send a quite a big group to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">But there was this list, and that was a collective passport, like a collective passport and this was the basic to from the <span class="building">Swiss Consulate</span> to give out shutzpasses. </sentence><sentence id="365">So we was between the first uh group to get the shutzpasses because we both , our name, our family was in this uh in this list. </sentence><sentence id="366">The <span class="building">headquarter</span> to make this <span class="dlf">shutzpasses</span> was in the . </sentence><sentence id="367">This was a <span class="building">house</span> uh what uh created from the <span class="building">Swiss Consulate</span>, because the Swiss Emb...the <span class="building">Swiss Embassy</span> was not uh...it
