<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Norbert Yasharoff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, the capital of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> in 1930, to the family of a prominent, successful Jewish lawyer by the of Yossif, or Joseph, Yasharoff and my mother, Nelly the daughter of Bulgarian Jewish parents who lived in <span class="country">Egypt</span>, <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>, prior to World War One. </sentence><sentence id="10">And then after the death of my grandfather, my grandmother and her three daughters, including my mother, came back to <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me about growing up in this <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">What was your early childhood like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: To the best of my recollection, the early childhood was a very pleasant one: a life of comparative plenty, of wonderful vacations either in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> or the <span class="env feature">Black Sea</span> in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>, with fine clothes mostly bought by my father on his business trips to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and other <span class="populated place">Western European capitals</span>, a peaceful life, a very family life. </sentence><sentence id="18">Our extended family was quite large, and our <span class="building">house</span>, especially while my grandparents was alive -- on my father's side -- was the center of that life. </sentence><sentence id="19">So major Jewish holidays and any other festive occasions were festive, quite festive. </sentence><sentence id="20">We had a large <span class="building">house</span> in downtown <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, not far from the <span class="building">Fire Brigade Headquarters</span> -- which was a landmark at that time -- with a huge <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> with a <span class="spatial object">gazebo</span> and wonderful <span class="env feature">trees</span> and flowers. </sentence><sentence id="21">And memories from family gatherings either in the <span class="building">gazebo</span> or just sitting in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> in the early evening are really etched in my memory. </sentence><sentence id="22">In sum, until almost the fall -- autumn of 1939, all my recollections are one of a pleasurable, warm and happy childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Do you have any sisters or brothers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes, I have a sister. </sentence><sentence id="32">She was born in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="33">She lives in <span class="country">Israel</span> today with her family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: What was your awareness of being a Jewish child in <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Yeah, that a -- my first clash, so to speak, with the reality of being slightly different from the other children in the <span class="building">public school</span> which I attended when, in the second grade,  we started having so called religion lessons, verouchenie" in <span class="country">Bulgarian</span> "study of the faith," which I had to attend, or at least I thought that I had to attend. </sentence><sentence id="40">I was being teased by other children about the role or the Jews in killing Christ and so on -- which first took me aback and then, of course, became very unpleasant until my parents arranged for me to be excused. </sentence><sentence id="41">And there was no problem -- I was excused. </sentence><sentence id="42">But that was the only awareness of being different and being sort of set apart or being teased about it. </sentence><sentence id="43">Very rarely, the other children would use the Turkish word chifut", which I understand it to mean "infidel," or somebody of another, inferior, faith. </sentence><sentence id="44">But that occurred very rarely until, as I say, the Autumn 1939, and the outbreak of World War Two. </sentence><sentence id="45">Incidentally, we were vacationing in a wonderful <span class="building">hotel</span>, in a <span class="building">spa resort</span> in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="populated place">Soludervent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">And we were -- this was the eve of our return to <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> at the end of the vacation, August 31st, when in the evening over the radio came the news of the outbreak of World War Two. </sentence><sentence id="47">I was nine and a half years, my little sister was three. </sentence><sentence id="48">The only indication that...of course, I knew war is not a good thing, but what shook me at that time was...were the worried glances exchanged between the adults. </sentence><sentence id="49">We were all gathering in the <span class="interior space">social hall</span> of that lovely <span class="building">hotel</span> and then one of them -- men, the Jewish friends -- in a group exclaimed, "Oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="50">What is going to happen with us now." </sentence><sentence id="51">And that shook me because I always regarded that man as a rock of strength and a power always cheerful and, and witty and he indeed looked distress and sort of, as though he suddenly got diminished in size in front of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="52">My father was also very worried, but he didn't say much. </sentence><sentence id="53">And then we went back, of course, to our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">Life continued normally, but for the first time, not only newspapers, but the <span class="spatial object">radios</span> started carrying very openly antisemitic statements. </sentence><sentence id="55">Some of them even attributed to officials. </sentence><sentence id="56">For example, I remember on the way to <span class="building">school</span> at <span class="building">newsstands</span> reading the bold, in bold face, headlines speaking of the international conspiracy of Jews and many other things which I didn't even understand at the time but I had to go back <span class="building">home</span> and ask my father for the meaning of those words. </sentence><sentence id="57">But the impressions are -- they are engraved in my memory of the name Jews and all the other epitaphs and adjectives that came with it. </sentence><sentence id="58">That was the Autumn of "39. </sentence><sentence id="59">Apart from this, the beginnings of an anti-Jewish campaign in the <span class="building">press</span> I don't recall anything worse happening. </sentence><sentence id="60">Of course with the press and officials openly castigating the Jews, a lot of other people, who until that time we thought were friends, especially in my case, other children Christian children that lived up and down our <span class="dlf">street</span> -- started using the word chifut more and more often. </sentence><sentence id="61">And by -- in early 1940, I remember, and that particular Christian boy was -- I considered him a close friend because he would come and play in our <span class="dlf">front yard</span> almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="62">So he started really teasing me and harassing me but -- and even getting very, very offensive -- telling me all that he had obviously heard at <span class="building">home</span> about the Jews this or that. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I remember myself, a normally well behaved boy actually retorting with a curse, "I wish you were dead." </sentence><sentence id="64">Now I mention " Religious instruction (Bulgarian) ? </sentence><sentence id="65">Kike (Bulgarian)  this because a few months later, this boy got a sunstroke and died, and I felt such tremendous guilt that I sneaked at his funeral and watched a little bit the <span class="building">church</span> services preceding the actual burial in secret, in a sort of childish attempt at atonement that what I felt was probably a death that I had brought about my intemperate reaction to his teasing. </sentence><sentence id="66">But these are all very, very strong things for a 10 or 11 year old to experience. </sentence><sentence id="67">I guess I was 10 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="68">So that was 1940, things like that were happening. </sentence><sentence id="69">The anti-Jewish campaign, as I say, was growing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: How were your parents reacting to all this? </sentence><sentence id="104">What was it like in <span class="country">Poland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="108">At <span class="building">home</span>, of course the main topic of conversation was the War, how it was going, tremendous concern about the failure of the anti-Axis forces, especially the fall of <span class="country">France</span>, and the fall of most of the <span class="region">Western Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Daily bulletins and consultations between my father and his friends. </sentence><sentence id="110">They didn't conduct normal conversations about war. </sentence><sentence id="111">They always would pull out a actual map of <span class="country">Europe</span> and would move little pins on the <span class="spatial object">map</span> to see what had been lost to the Germans and so on. </sentence><sentence id="112">Growing concern. </sentence><sentence id="113">A lot of talk about what had happened already to Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> and what was probably happening. </sentence><sentence id="114">In 1940, of course. </sentence><sentence id="115">there was no information about that at all reaching us. </sentence><sentence id="116">At that time, we still were...were still allowed to own <span class="spatial object">radios</span> so we can listen to the BBC and to other radio stations including the Voice of America, clandestinely of course. </sentence><sentence id="117"><span class="country">Bulgaria</span> had not joined officially the Axis yet. </sentence><sentence id="118">This occurred toward the end of 1940, but this were the kind of conversations at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">The thing that stands out in my mind is that younger members -- younger relatives would -- who belonged to Zionist organizations -- would speak about <span class="country">Palestine</span> and immigration to <span class="country">Palestine</span> being the only salvation for Bulgarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="120">And my father, the well accepted, well adjusted not assimilated in the religious sense, but culturally assimilated Jew would always oppose that. </sentence><sentence id="121">Even at that time. </sentence><sentence id="122">As late as 1940, he could not imagine any circumstances under which it would be better to leave native and familiar <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> for life in a murky, little known, <span class="region">uncharted territory</span> in a <span class="populated place">British colony</span> in the <span class="region">Middle East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">So, I vividly remember those altercations with my younger -- well, younger relatives, male relatives, with my father always coming out against Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="124">He, of course, lived to eat his words and ended up in <span class="country">Israel</span> as probably I'll talk about this later, at the end of War Two and with the establishment of the State of <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Go back to that <span class="interior space">room</span> and pins on the maps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="146">The pins on the <span class="spatial object">maps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">Nineteen forty-one, of course, Hitler finally, in spite of his pact with the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, non-aggression pact orders the invasion of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, the Operation Barbarasa, if I recall. </sentence><sentence id="148">That was frightening for us for a number of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="149">That brought about the <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>'s official joining of the Axis, and by March of 1941, if I am not wrong. </sentence><sentence id="150">Yes, yeh, I remember it exactly, and I'll explain in a moment. </sentence><sentence id="151"><span class="country">Bulgaria</span> by signing the pact also agreed to allowing passage of German troops to <span class="region">Bulgarian territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152"> As a matter of fact, March 25, "41, the day my Grandmother died and that was the day of her funeral, coincided with the arrival of German troops in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">Why do I remember? </sentence><sentence id="154">Because just opposite our front <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, there was the one and only <span class="building">Mercedes Benz dealership</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the first German troops that arrived started using that <span class="building">garage</span>, that <span class="building">dealership</span>, as a short of small <span class="building">local headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">And a lot of these young, blond eyed and basically rather likeable young men were coming and using the <span class="spatial object">fountain</span> in our <span class="dlf">front yard</span> to wash in the morning and so on. </sentence><sentence id="156">And so the Germans were there! </sentence><sentence id="157">Next <span class="dlf">door</span> to us. </sentence><sentence id="158">Now this did not happen exactly on the 25th. </sentence><sentence id="159">This came later. </sentence><sentence id="160">But what happened on March 25th we had a very impressive funeral procession for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="161">My father, being quite prominent in the Jewish community and very active in the <span class="building">Jewish orphanage</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, the children of the <span class="building">orphanage</span> would march first, then all the active Rabbis, four of them if I am not mistaken, would march after them, and then, of course, the <span class="spatial object">coffin</span> and the long procession of relatives and friends after that. </sentence><sentence id="162">Through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, on foot, all the way from our <span class="building">house</span> in downtown <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> which was a good 3 miles away. </sentence><sentence id="163">Now at one point, just as our procession proceeds down one of the main <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, a detachment of German soldiers comes from the opposite direction. </sentence><sentence id="164">And this is my recollection of myself suddenly freezing in my tracks and...and looking at both processions, and registering that while the ours veered a little bit to the side in order for the Germans to pass, none on both...no one on either side looked at each other's eyes. </sentence><sentence id="165">They just passed along side each other totally ignoring the existence of each other. </sentence><sentence id="166">And that is my recollection. </sentence><sentence id="167">That was March of "45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: "41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Forty-one -- Sorry! </sentence><sentence id="194">Forty-one. </sentence><sentence id="195">And a major thing happened in January of "41. </sentence><sentence id="196">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="197">By the end of 1940, under German pressure the Bulgarian Government decided that anti- Jewish laws modeled on the Nuremberg laws would have to be promulgated. </sentence><sentence id="198">This was a very firm demand on the Germans that neither the, by now, Fascist government of Bogdan Filov nor the King" were prepared to oppose. </sentence><sentence id="199">They felt that this is the least they can do to accommodate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="200">So they, they had appointed by that time a so called Commissar of Jewish Affairs of one of the most virulent antisemites in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>, a member of the right-wing antisemitic group, Ratnitsi*, Aleksandur Belev, who was sent to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to study the German legislation and bring back a Bulgarian version. </sentence><sentence id="201">Well, he did, and by the end of 1940, that legislation, after debates and some quite vocal opposition in <span class="building">parliament</span>, was adopted, signed by the King in early January, and its enforcement began in January of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="202">And now, why do I remember all this? </sentence><sentence id="203">Because suddenly -- and that preceded the death of my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was very ill. </sentence><sentence id="205">But apart from our concern over her health, the other two major concerns that were discussed every opportunity at <span class="building">home</span> were, especially for Father, how to come up with a large sum of ready cash in order to pay our assessment under the so-called "unique tax" that was 3 King Boris III of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> * Ratnitsi Napreduka na Bulgarshtinata [Champions of the Bulgarian Advancement] (Bulgarian)  imposed as a first step toward ultimate confiscation of Jewish property and "b" how to find documentary proof of his service some 25 years earlier as a military prosecutor with the Bulgarian Armed Forces -- a service that under the law could exempt him from some of the restrictions, especially the restriction on professionals to practice their profession. </sentence><sentence id="206">If I may jump into a little bit further into the future, he ultimately was able to prove that and for a while he enjoyed that privilege of continuing to work and not wearing the normal star -- the yellow Star of David, but a yellow little pin which indicated that he was a Jew, but a privileged Jew. </sentence><sentence id="207">So, back to "<span class="populated place">41</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: What else was happening in your <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">It's January "41. </sentence><sentence id="227">You hear these arguments. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="231">What else is going on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well then the death of my grandmother, of course. </sentence><sentence id="233">The Germans already being in <span class="country">Bulgarian</span> the unease -- especially of our family -- of having to confront German soldiers daily from early morning. </sentence><sentence id="234">That side by side with an ever growing anti-Jewish campaign in the <span class="building">Press</span>, already with anti-Jewish legislation in force. </sentence><sentence id="235">We were already marked as enemies of the people, as exploiters. </sentence><sentence id="236">We weren't wearing yet the yellow Star of David, but we were easy prey for anyone. </sentence><sentence id="237">Now the other stipulations of the law, which applied to Jews not being able to possess <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, <span class="spatial object">telephones</span>, began to be implemented. </sentence><sentence id="238">After the first payments of the unique tax, then Jews had to dispose of <span class="dlf">property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">They were allowed for the time being to keep an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> or some other <span class="building">dwelling</span> for their own use, but even that became questionable by the Autumn of 1941, when a new regulation was published that Jews were not allowed to live in the general <span class="region">areas</span> of the <span class="populated place">Capital</span> but had to live either in or very close to the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span> of <span class="populated place">Yuch Bunar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">Well, we ended up by October in the <span class="building">house</span> sharing the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of relatives in a place very near to the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>, but not inside of it. </sentence><sentence id="241">But prior to that, we had to undergo another dislocation. </sentence><sentence id="242">In our own <span class="building">house</span>, which was a <span class="building">three story building</span>, we occupied the <span class="interior space">second floor</span>, which was the best designed, and we had lived in it for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="243">But as I said with the Jews being easy prey for anything, a Bulgarian lawyer married to a German woman had cast his eye on our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and he wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="244">Through his contacts with the Fascist authorities, we were given the order to vacate it in less than a week. </sentence><sentence id="245">We moved <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> into the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that was used before as an <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">And what stands out in my mind is that they -- the Bulgarian lawyer and his German wife moved in, they conducted a sort of cleansing, religious ceremony with holy water and everything, but expressly done in order to cleanse the Jewish spirit out of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">And we were even asked to be present at that time. </sentence><sentence id="248">Now I don't remember this myself, but I remember the mortification of my parents when that ceremony was over, to that extent. </sentence><sentence id="249">And we were supposed to continue living in the same <span class="building">house</span>! </sentence><sentence id="250">From this point of view, it was lucky that we were forced to move into the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> where the Bulgarian authorities felt that we should be concentrated. </sentence><sentence id="251">Little did we realize at the time that this was the first stage in a plan to eventually expel us from the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, and as the original plans were, to ship us away to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: You are now in this bottom <span class="interior space">apartment</span>? </sentence><sentence id="253">What was going on? </sentence><sentence id="254">Your father, you told me, was involved in the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="255">Did that have any impact on this situation? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Not very directly. </sentence><sentence id="257">Well, of course, he continued his work with the <span class="building">orphanage</span> primarily. </sentence><sentence id="258">And, as a lawyer, who was also accredited to the religious -- <span class="building">Jewish religious courts</span> because he could appear in personal status cases, divorces and so on, so he continued. </sentence><sentence id="259">Well, he was being consulted very often by the, by the very active members of the <span class="building">Consistory</span>, to -- what to do to alleviate the plight of some Jews from this stipulation of the law or another. </sentence><sentence id="260">And this is what the Bulgarian Jews did very well. </sentence><sentence id="261">They pulled their resources of friends among the Bulgarian community, especially lawyers, doctors, intellectuals, writers, and so on, in order to -- here and there -- help each other obtain an exemption or alleviate some other case. </sentence><sentence id="262">So to that extent he was very he was very active because he had contacts especially among the Judirical circles of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">Some people did not turn their back on the Jews immediately. </sentence><sentence id="264">But here I have to -- if I may want to tell you of a little incident that occurred that showed me that not all former friends were ready to maintain the friendship and not turn their back. </sentence><sentence id="265">And this may have been naturally earlier in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="266">I know because I was 10 years old with another 10 year old Jewish friend. </sentence><sentence id="267">We went to wait for a girlfriend of ours who lived opposite the <span class="building">Soviet Embassy</span> -- and of course, <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> never cut off its diplomatic relations with the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> in spite of German pressure -- and she was a little delayed, so we went -- waited <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">There was, what we thought, a <span class="building">cab station</span> of <span class="spatial object">taxi cabs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">My friend was the mischievous type. </sentence><sentence id="270">He started playing with the tires of some of the <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Of course, I was not. </sentence><sentence id="272">I was too well behaved to even think of that. </sentence><sentence id="273">But he did it. </sentence><sentence id="274">And suddenly, what again we thought were the cab drivers, two of them rushed after him, trying to catch him. </sentence><sentence id="275">A third one came to me and he immediately pulled out a police badge and said, "Well, we are from the <span class="building">Secret Police</span> and you are going to lead us to where your friend is." </sentence><sentence id="276">I was stupefied, I didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="277">Playing a little joke like that, yeh, it's bad enough. </sentence><sentence id="278">But why would the police suddenly -- and people who were cab drivers?Well, we ended up, both of us, in the -- in what they called, well the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the Secret, Secret police, the Bulgarian equivalent of perhaps the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="279">And you can imagine trying to investigate two 10 years old which involved writing depositions slowly in our calligraphic style. </sentence><sentence id="280">Finally, my father was brought in, and I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="281">Apparently the chief investigator knew my father very well from appearances in <span class="building">courts</span>, he himself having -- being a lawyer, the investigator. </sentence><sentence id="282">He never turned to face my father. </sentence><sentence id="283">He was looking all the time at the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">And he gave him a lecture in my presence, which is the first time that I had ever seen anybody talk down to my father. </sentence><sentence id="285">For me, my father was the one who would talk down to anyone else, including myself. </sentence><sentence id="286">Suddenly, I see my father, as  elegantly dressed as ever, but almost like shrinking inside, and I think I mentioned this before, but this is what happened in the vision of a 10 year old where all these strong men suddenly under the pressure of humiliation and degradation, shrink in size in your eyes. </sentence><sentence id="287">Because they, they cannot do much to defend themselves and, and then you -- for a moment, you start to lose a little bit even your previous respect for them. </sentence><sentence id="288">But there was my father silently listening to this sermon about the way the Jewish families raise their children in an anti-Bulgarian, anti-nationalist, anti-governmental spirit. </sentence><sentence id="289">My father who had been the epitome of good citizenship throughout his life -- a Jew who insisted we speak -- that without any trace of Ladino or other Jewish accent -- the Bulgarian language because he spoke it that way. </sentence><sentence id="290">He had to listen to this petty functionary who didn't have even the guts of turning and walk -- and looking him in the eye, for half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="291">Finally, the verdict was 500 leva which quite a bit of money at that time, almost 500 dollar fine, and the warning that should I be caught doing such subversive things in the future, the consequences will be much, much harsher. </sentence><sentence id="292">Now what was the whole thing about? </sentence><sentence id="293">What did it turn out to be? </sentence><sentence id="294">Those so called <span class="spatial object">taxi cabs</span> were actually Secret Service people in disguise stationed at a reasonable, but still very convenient distance from the <span class="building">Soviet Embassy</span>, and with orders to be ready every time a <span class="spatial object">car</span> pulls out from the <span class="building">Soviet Embassy</span> to follow it. </sentence><sentence id="295">So the assumption was that we had been sent by someone to sabotage the Secret Police's attempts to monitor the movements of the Soviets in the <span class="populated place">Capital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">But by the time of our release, I'm sure that even that antisemitic investigator was convinced that there was no plot here and no conspiracy, just the act of a foolish boy, and watched and not prevented by another small foolish boy. </sentence><sentence id="297">So, I took you back to 1940, but to go back to the end of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="298">As I mentioned by October of that year, we had relocated for a second time and began living in the <span class="region">ghettoized area</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">Another almost traumatic experience of the time was the fact that the Bulgarians, being under constant German pressure to make the life of Jews more and more miserable in order to prepare Bulgarian public opinion for an eventual deportation of Jews, the Bulgarian government brought to trial a Jewish industrialist, the only one who was allowed to continue working under the anti-Jewish legislation, as a manager of his expropriated <span class="building">plant</span>, a <span class="building">textile plant</span>, was suddenly brought to <span class="building">court</span> on the charges of economic crimes. </sentence><sentence id="300">They were trumped up charges. </sentence><sentence id="301">My father, who had been his lawyer for many, many years, began defending him in this case. </sentence><sentence id="302">Well, for all those who -- for all Jews who were watching the trial and knew about what an economic crime charge meant and what it would bring, it was obvious that the man will not -- his life will not be spared. </sentence><sentence id="303">But my father invested all of his Judirical talent in the hope that maybe through effective -- an effective defense, he could save him. </sentence><sentence id="304">Well, he did not. </sentence><sentence id="305">And not only that he was sentenced to death, but my father was -- I mean the client was sentenced to death, but my father was forced to observe the actual execution to hang him. </sentence><sentence id="306">And I will never forget this man and his face when he came back from that execution that afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="307">I had never seen him more devastated. </sentence><sentence id="308">Totally devastated and blaming himself for not having done  enough when everybody knew that it was -- this was just a show trial. </sentence><sentence id="309">The Bulgarians had to have something to show both the Germans and also the general populace that the Jews were economic exploiters and criminals who, in spite of all the legislation against them, were still prone to commit crimes. </sentence><sentence id="310">So that was end of 1940 -- 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: The end of 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="374">No, I am sorry. </sentence><sentence id="375">All this happened toward the end of 1940 -- 1942. </sentence><sentence id="376">Yeh, 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: All the events of the trial and also the relocation occurred in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="384">Life while we still were not -- we were not restricted in our movements.... We could go out. </sentence><sentence id="385">Yeh, we could go out, there were no prohibited <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">I think toward the very end, in the beginning of 1943, some night curfews were imposed on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="387">Imposed in the sense that we were not supposed to be outside on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> after nine o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="388">But some Jews did not fully comply with that and because the wearing of yellow Stars of David was not fully enforced yet, some of them could get away with breaking the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="389">But by early 1943, every Jew from the age of 10 up, including myself, had to wear the yellow Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="390">My father wore for awhile just the yellow pin. </sentence><sentence id="391">By that time he was still practicing, but in a very, very limited manner. </sentence><sentence id="392">Our lives were mainly revolved around the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, the central <span class="building">synagogue</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, to which we went more often than ever before. </sentence><sentence id="393">And, of course, there was another <span class="building">synagogue</span> in the proper Israel -- <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span> proper, the <span class="building">Yuch Bunar</span>, but we mainly went to the central <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">Friends and family would gather and that was our life. </sentence><sentence id="395">Of course, living in much -- in <span class="interior space">cramped quarters</span>, sharing -- two or three families sharing one <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">Luckily we had a <span class="interior space">room</span> and a half so that I had at least a separate place to sleep than my parents. </sentence><sentence id="397">It was bearable. </sentence><sentence id="398">Strangely enough from a childish viewpoint all of these things had also a funny and, and exciting aspect about them. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was never boring. </sentence><sentence id="400">One had to adjust to new situations. </sentence><sentence id="401">Some of them were very, very joyful because people were thrown together more with family and with friends. </sentence><sentence id="402">And when people tried to alleviate their plight, you know, they become very resourceful and there was always entertainment of some kind. </sentence><sentence id="403">This continued even during the darker years of the expulsion and the resettlement outside of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="404">Some of these aspects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: What about food? </sentence><sentence id="428">Did you have any trouble getting food at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: No, again. </sentence><sentence id="430">No, not at this point. </sentence><sentence id="431">Most Jews of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> were middle class Jews. </sentence><sentence id="432">Of course, the Jews of <span class="populated place">Yuch Bunar</span> were less educated and more impoverished. </sentence><sentence id="433">But nobody at this point starved yet. </sentence><sentence id="434">The people, in spite of all the, the taxation and the expropriation, and being prohibited from working and holding jobs, people still could survive on savings and on loans from family and so on. </sentence><sentence id="435">Incidentally, as early as the summer of 1941 and through 1942 and through most of "43, Jewish men from the age of 18 through, I think 38 or 40, were all called up for service in what at the beginning were labor brigades within the framework of the Army and Corps of Engineers in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> and later under the <span class="building">Ministry for Public Works</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">This was, in effect, forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="437">These were <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> so which they were not paid anything. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were away from their families. </sentence><sentence id="439">And when the time for the expulsion of Soviet Jewry arrived, many families did not have their males with them in order to help organize the quick departure and everything. </sentence><sentence id="440">I touch on that in a letter that I wrote in June of 1943 from the northern <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> to a cousin of mine who, because he was so much older, I called "Uncle" -- addressed as "Uncle." </sentence><sentence id="441">And he was one of those Jewish males who had been away for almost two years serving in <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> and away from his own family when they had to leave <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, so in a way my letter describes to him the day when we saw his own family off at a time when he was not around. </sentence><sentence id="442">But that was when we were expelled ultimately to <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">Since we are touching on that, why don't I go into the quickly developing events of the Spring of 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="459"> By May 19th, suddenly through the <span class="dlf">grapevine</span> -- because we no longer had access to radios, but some people did listen clandestinely at the <span class="building">homes</span> of Bulgarian friends, but mainly from newspapers, which of course we could still obtain -- the news came that <span class="building">Radio Berlin</span> had announced that the Bulgarian government was planning the deportation of all Bulgarian Jews from the old boundaries of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">Immediate panic and chaos! </sentence><sentence id="461">Although we didn't really -- we had no firm news about the fate of the Jews in <span class="country">Poland</span> or those Jews who were being deported to <span class="country">Poland</span>, but the feeling was that nothing good was happening there. </sentence><sentence id="462">So tremendous fear and panic! </sentence><sentence id="463">Some Jewish families within two days started getting the first orders for so-called resettlement in the <span class="region">provinces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">The orders gave them between three to five days to get ready to leave <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="465">By the evening or night of May 22nd, 23rd, and this is another thing that I describe in the letter I mentioned, the news become bad. </sentence><sentence id="466">Jewish leaders in their attempts to get firm news from the authorities from the <span class="building">court</span>, from -- were unable to reach anyone. </sentence><sentence id="467">Obviously, even the King had left the <span class="populated place">city</span> at that time, in spite of the fact that this was the eve of a major Bulgarian holiday May 24th, Saint Cyril and Methodius, which is the day of education, the day of Bulgarian culture, with the King usually present at the parades that take place in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">But he was no where to be reached. </sentence><sentence id="469">Finally, some Jewish leaders managed to get hold of the head of the <span class="building">Bulgarian Orthodox church</span> --  0 Archbishop Stefan*, known for his pro-Allied sympathies in spite of the fact that he was at the head of the <span class="building">Bulgarian church</span> at the time when <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> was already allied with the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="470">And he immediately started calling people -- top people in the government -- and personally went even to the <span class="building">King's palace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">He was unable to talk to the King but he left a strongly worded note there warning the King, that God will not be merciful if he signs the death warrant of the Jews by expelling them, the assumption being expulsion first from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> to other <span class="region">outlying areas</span> close to the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> for eventual shipment to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">Whether this worked or not, the fact is that none of the expulsion orders were rescinded but the original plans developed by that Commissar for Jewish Affairs under German pressure and with an explicit agreement with the German Ambassador to <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, of which we learned later, the plans were to -- the expulsion to be only the first phase of a two phase process -- the second being shipment to <span class="country">Poland</span> for extermination. </sentence><sentence id="473">Well, the second phase was never carried out, which explains the facts that all of us Bulgarian Jews who numbered about 48,000 at the time of these events, survived with a few exceptions of Jewish partisans and others who took part in the resistance against the Fascist regime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: Let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="490">You are about to be deported to <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">Tell me what happens to you then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: Well, those were horrible days, especially the night of May 22nd, 23rd which remains engraved in my memory as the most horrible night that we went through when we, we knew that we're going to be sent to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">That was the conviction at the time, that this is what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="497">We didn't sleep at all. </sentence><sentence id="498">The four of us, my little sister, mother and father, hugging each other and crying, at one point my father saying that, well the need may arise for my mother and him to leave the two of us, my sister and I, in the care of others in order to save us. </sentence><sentence id="499">We, in turn, started crying and saying that, no way, we were not going to part with them no matter what happens. </sentence><sentence id="500">The morning finally mercifully put an end to that night, but with even worse news that more Jews had received eviction -- expulsion notices. </sentence><sentence id="501">And stories from our own members of our family who lived in the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarters</span> that people are running to the <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span> asking for help. </sentence><sentence id="502">The Jewish functionaries being even more confused than the poor people themselves, being totally of no help. </sentence><sentence id="503">Finally, a lot of Jews congregating in the central <span class="building">synagogue</span> where the Chief Rabbi tries to sooth them and assure them that everything possible by way of protest and intercession will be done. </sentence><sentence id="504">The Jews dispersing that evening feeling a little more encouraged, but still very, very worried. </sentence><sentence id="505">The following day, the holiday that I mentioned, May the 24th, Jews again congregate in, or try to congregate in -- at the central <span class="building">synagogue</span>, but they find it locked because some of the Jewish leadership decided that it will be too dangerous to allow a large crowd to assemble because the Fascist authorities immediately will try to disperse it by force. </sentence><sentence id="506">&gt; Metropolitan Stefan of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>  1 Besides the feeling was that with the pent up emotions and fear and panic, a demonstration may occur, which again will end in bloodshed. </sentence><sentence id="507">Some of the leadership or most of the leadership was in favor of trying to enlist the help of sympathetic Bulgarians and the <span class="building">Church</span> and the <span class="building">courts</span> rather than engage in demonstrations and clashes with the police. </sentence><sentence id="508">In spite of all that, in the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span> proper, a group of 200 and more Jews did organize themselves and started a demonstration which was put down with tremendous cruelty by the Bulgarian police and agents of that <span class="building">Commissariat for Jewish Affairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">As my cousin, who is exactly my age told me at the time -- and he went -- recently when we met after so many years. </sentence><sentence id="510">He was watching the whole thing from the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> of their <span class="building">house</span> and the Bulgarian authorities had brought the machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="511">Of course, guns and every conceivable weapons against totally unarmed, but young and strong Bulgarian young -- Jewish young men. </sentence><sentence id="512">There was a scuffle. </sentence><sentence id="513">Some of the policemen were hurt simply by the physical strength of some of these guys, but eventually everybody was rounded up, beaten, and some of them even ended up being sent to the only <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> that was established in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> -- a real <span class="populated place">Nazi-style concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">It's not far from the <span class="populated place">city</span> to which we were eventually banished, <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">The name of the place of <span class="populated place">Somovit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="516">Later, Jewish leaders, especially those who were very active in the protest action and enlisting help of sympathetic Bulgarians, were rounded up, arrested, and banished to that same place. </sentence><sentence id="517">When I say "Nazi-style," of course, I mean the day-to-day treatment, but they all survived. </sentence><sentence id="518">No one was killed. </sentence><sentence id="519">Other Jews, who had been apprehended as partisans fighting with the Communists or other anti-Fascists resistance ended up in special <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> for partisans which were harsher. </sentence><sentence id="520">They were not sent to the same one, <span class="populated place">Jewish concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="521">So this is --we are speaking about May 24, 1943 -- the demonstration in the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span> crushed the attempts of Jewish leaders to cancel the orders of expulsion failed, but at least intervention of the <span class="building">Church</span> and other members of the intelligentsia seemed to have convinced the King to rescind the order for the further -- for phase number two, namely the shipment to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="522">That is very important to note because if that was not -- if that ultimate shipment was not postponed, we would have ended up like all the other 6,000,000 Jews in the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="523">By postponing it, even for a few months it made a whole difference because in the meantime events like the Battle of <span class="populated place">Stalingrad</span> and the Allied landings in <span class="country">Italy</span> -- in one word, the beginning of <span class="country">Germany</span>'s defeat had already become a process which was watched carefully by the Bulgarian authorities, by the King. </sentence><sentence id="524">Historical experience had taught them that in 19-- in World War One, as Allies again of the German lead entente, they were losers, dismembered in terms of <span class="region">territory</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="525">So the beginning of caution and a little of putting a little bit of distance between <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> and the Germans had begun, at least in the minds of the King and some other leaders. </sentence><sentence id="526">From -- which in turn mean that it would be most foolish at that point, with <span class="country">Germany</span> obviously losing the War, to hand them over the Jews and thus be branded as a collaborator of <span class="country">Germany</span> and a very humanitarian issue, while by saving the Jews, <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> could score some points in a future peace conference and get more  2 lenient treatment. </sentence><sentence id="527">That was the thinking as, of course, we learned after the War from many, many writings on the subject both from ex-officials and others on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="528">Eventual shipment to <span class="country">Poland</span> was cancelled as a plan, but our expulsion from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> took place. </sentence><sentence id="529">Our own family had to leave three or four days after May 24th, we landed in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, which we had asked for as a matter of fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="565">Q: Back up a moment. </sentence><sentence id="566">Before we get there, I would like to know about that journey. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="570">Well, the journey itself was rather pleasant, you know, packing and, of course, disposing of most of our stuff either by selling it or passing it on to Bulgarian friends for safekeeping was a very painful process, especially when my mother was ill at the time and in <span class="building">hospital</span>, so my father and I virtually had to, had to do the whole packing. </sentence><sentence id="571">But again, I, as a child, for me these were tremendous responsibilities and the very fact that I was able to, to be of some constructive help gave me tremendous satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="572">We were ready by the day mentioned in our expulsion orders. </sentence><sentence id="573">My mother, luckily, had fully recovered, and we all went to the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="574">And again, here, friendships and, and the fact that most Bulgarians, especially urban Bulgarians, had no history of virulent or deep seated antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="575">Little acts of help and assistance and moral support were not uncommon. </sentence><sentence id="576">In our particular case we were met at, at the <span class="building">train station</span> by a Bulgarian friend in a high position with the <span class="dlf">Bulgarian railroads</span> who quietly led us to a <span class="interior space">compartment</span>, almost a <span class="interior space">first class compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">The rest of our brethren had to travel third class, but again, there were no, no <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> which our other brothers were carried in to their deaths. </sentence><sentence id="578">No, it was a regular <span class="spatial object">Bulgarian train</span>, and we were given a very nice <span class="interior space">compartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">The men helped us quieted the whole time, but before bidding goodbye and a very curt goodbye, we saw that his eyes were filled with tears. </sentence><sentence id="580">He was afraid to speak openly in order not to be seen being so kind to the enemies of the people as we were being to be at the time. </sentence><sentence id="581">But he wanted to say silently and through his tears that there are Bulgarians who feel that this is a tremendous and crazy injustice being done to us. </sentence><sentence id="582">It was a very moving moment at that time. </sentence><sentence id="583">The trip itself was very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="584">Of course, for two children like my sister and I, we looked at the June sunny <span class="env feature">sky</span> and it was fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: At that point, let us stop please. </sentence><sentence id="602">I want to change -- we have to change tapes and then we'll pick it up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="605">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="606">End of Tape #1  3 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: Would you tell us what happened when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> arrived at <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: We were met at the <span class="building">train station</span> by the sister of -- well by the sister of the husband -- my aunt's husband. </sentence><sentence id="612">They were originally from <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> and that's why we actually pushed to get sent to <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> because we had some family there on, on my aunt's side -- her husband's side. </sentence><sentence id="613">So these nice people were there waiting for us, as they had probably done it for many other friends and acquaintances from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">They took us directly to their own <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="615">A small <span class="building">house</span>, but on three <span class="interior space">floors</span>, already filled with other expellees from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="616">And they gave us their own <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and they moved to the <span class="interior space">attic</span> in order to accommodate us. </sentence><sentence id="617">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="618">After all the shocking and enervating events of the days prior to our departure from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, spending two days in the warm and cheerful hospitality of Mrs. Visa and her husband -- that was her name -- was very, very recuperative. </sentence><sentence id="619">By that time the old <span class="building">house</span> where I would call him Uncle Isaac, the husband of my aunt was born and raised, his native <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> and which was occupied by another sister of his again became partly available for us. </sentence><sentence id="620">I must mention that my Uncle Isaac and my Aunt Lisa and her two children also came with us on the same, on the same <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="621">So whatever -- what living arrangements were made, they were all made for the two families. </sentence><sentence id="622">Of course, with us always being given a little bit of priority because we were the guests so to speak and they were returning <span class="building">home</span> in a way. </sentence><sentence id="623">Well, eight of us were accommodated in one truly large <span class="interior space">room</span> with nice access to the <span class="dlf">back yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">These are one story <span class="building">houses</span> in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, very rustic, but we had a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over our heads and at the beginning, you know, we were treated as guests, always having food prepared by those who already were living there, in the <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> branch of the family. </sentence><sentence id="625">So the first few weeks were, weeks of adjustment to a totally new -- to a totally new reality. </sentence><sentence id="626">But strangely enough, we arrived -- solace and even enjoyment -- when discovering that what we had thought originally that was going to be even worse did not materialize. </sentence><sentence id="627">So for example, we would compare notes with other <span class="populated place">cities</span> about which we were getting information about restriction on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="628">If we had, let's say only four hours of curfew a day, as opposed to -- as compared to other <span class="populated place">cities</span> where the Jews were not allowed in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> at all, for a while at least, which did not happen, or if we had more <span class="dlf">parks</span> available and open to us while other <span class="populated place">cities</span> did not allow their Jews to go to <span class="dlf">parks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="629">We derived pleasure from such little comparisons as to what can we get away with. </sentence><sentence id="630">And indeed after awhile the local authorities in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> saw in that influx of Jews from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> basically a tourist bonanza of sorts. </sentence><sentence id="631">Well some of us, regardless of the fact that we were not allowed to hold jobs and not own officially property, but some of us had money that was either given to Bulgarian friends and then smuggled monthly back to us, but some  4 money was brought to each of these <span class="region">outlying areas</span> by the more prosperous Jews. </sentence><sentence id="632">Now, the majority were not in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="633">The majority had to be quartered with other Jewish families and this was supervised by the Commissariat of Jewish, of Jewish Affairs very strictly -- sometimes cramming three or four families in a very, very small three room <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="634">But no one was left without a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over their heads. </sentence><sentence id="635">There was no need, and I am speaking of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> but I think the same happened in the other <span class="populated place">cities</span> to which <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> Jews were banished. </sentence><sentence id="636">There were no large <span class="populated place">concentration style camps</span> or <span class="building">barracks</span> established for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="637">They were all quartered with other Jews, other local Jews. </sentence><sentence id="638">Now, while <span class="building">housing</span> was taken care of unsatisfactorily -- but still was taken care of this way of course -- the question of food was not. </sentence><sentence id="639">Many, many Jews didn't have the financial resources to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="640">So again, Jewish organization began to, to occur. </sentence><sentence id="641">The already existing Pleven Constitory of Jews was expanded with members among the new arrivals from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, my father included. </sentence><sentence id="642">These people quickly organized <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span> to ensure that those Jews who could not afford to buy their own food will have two hot meals daily. </sentence><sentence id="643">The money came primarily from those Jews who, who had some money, and some money was provided by the <span class="building">Commissariat for Jewish Affairs</span>, the very, very bare minimum of course. </sentence><sentence id="644">Other resources must have been coming from somewhere, but I really have no recollection. </sentence><sentence id="645">I clearly remember the, the long <span class="dlf">lines</span> twice a day of the Jews waiting to get their soup. </sentence><sentence id="646">All this happened -- would occur in the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> where -- which was the center of all Jewish activities from <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span> to lectures to concerts that we organized. </sentence><sentence id="647">Even a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> was organized there. </sentence><sentence id="648">Although we were not prohibited from attending <span class="building">Bulgarian high schools</span> -- and I, in fact, began my first class of <span class="building">high school</span> in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> wearing my Star of David -- but yes, Children up to the age of 13 could not attend <span class="building">public schools</span> for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="649">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="650">I remember it because I used to take my little sister to the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> in the morning and pick her up at noon. </sentence><sentence id="651">So she could go only to the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> in the same place that I described a moment ago where everything else took place, including a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="652">But surprisingly everything functioned superbly. </sentence><sentence id="653">Both the <span class="building">school</span>, the <span class="interior space">soup kitchen</span>, all the cultural activities that were organized with a lot of talent, of course, being present among the Jews there to keep up the spirits of that community. </sentence><sentence id="654">And to that extent I am very proud of my father for being one of those who, who helped organize all this, and in that comes a story. </sentence><sentence id="655">Now, of course, they were all under the watchful eye of the antisemitic <span class="building">Commissariat for Jewish Affairs</span>, but apart from being personally liable for any infractions of the law, they were in no way to be compared to some of the Judenrats?(r) in, in Eastern <span class="country">Europe</span> during the War. </sentence><sentence id="656">Of course, deg <span class="building">Jewish council</span> (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to  5 their circumstances were much more horrible with the Germans being actually there. </sentence><sentence id="657">And a matter of life and death -- I'm not sarcastic here -- making any judgments, but the <span class="building">Jewish Consistories</span> in these <span class="populated place">Bulgarian cities</span> were totally different from the Judenrats. </sentence><sentence id="658">So these are my impressions of Jewish life there and, and they are not unpleasant impressions obviously. </sentence><sentence id="659">I was not one of those who had to wait for soup on the -- I might have felt totally differently. </sentence><sentence id="660">But there was a lot of togetherness. </sentence><sentence id="661">Many Jews became more Jewish during that time. </sentence><sentence id="662">Many Jews became exposed to Zionism for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="663">There were lectures on Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="664">Many Jews started studying Hebrew for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="665">So there was a Jewish reorientation, per force perhaps, but nevertheless a positive phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="666">There were, of course, the <span class="region">outside world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">How did the <span class="region">outside world</span> treat us. </sentence><sentence id="668">After all, we were there. </sentence><sentence id="669">We had curfew hours, mainly the evening at night. </sentence><sentence id="670">our movements were not that restricted even in the beginning, because it was felt that it would be good for the local economy to allow Jews to go to the <span class="spatial object">movies</span> whenever they wanted or to the few places that had some, some sweets or -- remember this is the war with rationing and everything, so many, many foods were absent. </sentence><sentence id="671">As I said, I was attending <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">In my case I was the only Jew in <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">And again, a little episode here which I think is worth mentioning. </sentence><sentence id="674">The non-Jewish members of the class, of course, treated me very badly -- mainly verbal abuse. </sentence><sentence id="675">Occasionally on the outside, in the <span class="dlf">street</span> young members of the...of the youth Fascist organization Branik who really resembled very much in their uniform, the Brown, the Brown shirts in the Hitlerjugend" in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">I knew in advance that if -- when I saw a couple of them that I will be beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="677">So I used to brace myself for that. </sentence><sentence id="678">| would pass by. </sentence><sentence id="679">They will slap me in the face, or do something else. </sentence><sentence id="680">I knew that I shouldn't do a thing. </sentence><sentence id="681">You know the Nazi, to provoke them further because there was no telling what will happen and just proceed, go on my way. </sentence><sentence id="682">This happened at least once a week to me on the way to <span class="building">school</span> or back. </sentence><sentence id="683">But in <span class="building">school</span> proper, the amazing thing was that the teachers would very often stand up in my defense or would give lectures to, especially a teacher of German -- of the German language -- which I was forced to learn at the time. </sentence><sentence id="684">And when she heard some remarks in class and or saw them pushing me in the <span class="dlf">corridor</span>, finally one day, she started speaking about Heine(r). </sentence><sentence id="685">And she pointed out, "But do you know that Heine was Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="686">She turned to the class, "And what does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="687">That a person can be a Jew and can be a good German, a great German poet and writer, just as we have Jews in our <span class="country">country</span> who are poets and writers and mathematicians" -- because of a major, prominent mathematician was among the Jews expelled from <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> and living in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> at the time, and he was well known. </sentence><sentence id="688">So I will never forget this kind of support from this woman who was basically educated in the German language and had traveled extensively to <span class="country">Germany</span>, but remained totally uncontaminated by Nazis on the  6 crazy hatred of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="689">On the contrary, she stood up. </sentence><sentence id="690">She even exempted me from giving the Fascist salute. </sentence><sentence id="691">Here I should back up and say that every, every class in different subjects -- be it Latin, or Bulgarian language and literature, or German language and literature -- would start with the people's jumping to salute when the Heil Hitler sign or the Bulgarian equivalent of it. </sentence><sentence id="692">Be it in Latin "Pro Regia in <span class="populated place">Patria Parati Summus</span>,"" "For the King and <span class="country">country</span>, we're ready to die." </sentence><sentence id="693">The same thing in German, and the same thing in Bulgarian. </sentence><sentence id="694">Well, she allowed me to remain seated when she would enter the <span class="building">class</span> and the rest would have to give the Fascist greeting to her in German. </sentence><sentence id="695">Yeh, so this was still 1943. </sentence><sentence id="696">Yeh, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="697">By that time, not only the attitude of individuals like this teacher, but it began to be obvious that even the authorities had embarked slowly and tacitly without any announcement on a sort of benign neglect policy vis a vis the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="698">In other words, all the anti-Jewish legislation had to be carried out, but without the same fierce -- without the fierceness that characterized that implementation at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="699">And this again was due to the fact that <span class="country">Germany</span> was losing the War. </sentence><sentence id="700">The Soviet Army was advancing rapidly across its own <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="701">I do not remember whether it was early 1944 or end of 1943 that. </sentence><sentence id="702">the Russians had virtually expelled all Germans from their <span class="region">territory</span> and were now advancing across Europe. </sentence><sentence id="703">No, it must have been early 1944. </sentence><sentence id="704">But anyway -- oh, the major event which I have to come back to in 1943 the sudden death of King Boris, the King of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> mysteriously -- mysterious death following by two days his return from a meeting with Hitler at <span class="populated place">Berchtesgaden</span> at Hitler's request. </sentence><sentence id="705">The King at that time must have been in his early 40s. </sentence><sentence id="706">We all knew him as a very athletic man, a hunter, a man who exercised and hiked a lot. </sentence><sentence id="707">The official story was that he had died of a -- from thrombosis, from heart ailment. </sentence><sentence id="708">Nobody believed that at the time, but we didn't know any better. </sentence><sentence id="709">Only after the War did we learn that at that fateful meeting in <span class="populated place">Berchtesgaden</span>, Hitler had asked him very firmly for two things: to finally hand over the Jews, and to finally send an expedition in force to fight the Soviets on the <span class="region">Eastern Front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="710">The King rejected both demands off hand at that time. </sentence><sentence id="711">It would have been suicidal for him to agree to such acts at the time when Hitler was already losing the War and he maintained diplomatic relations with, with the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> until the very last moment. </sentence><sentence id="712">In fact, it was the Soviets who after even the establishment of the very pro-Allied government in <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> by September fifth of 1944, they declared war on <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> for political reasons. </sentence><sentence id="713">But to go back to the death of the king, that was a tremendous event. </sentence><sentence id="714">Obviously, we, the Jews did not know how to feel because we weren't sure how helpful he had been to us. </sentence><sentence id="715">He obviously had acquiesced with a lot of the persecutions against us, but still a King is a King and we were watching with the rest of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> the news reels of his, of his funeral which was really very dramatic with hundreds of thousands of deg For King of our <span class="country">country</span> we are always ready (Latin)  7 people lining the <span class="dlf">routes</span> of the funeral procession in <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="716">After his death, his son, who was still a minor, was proclaimed King, but he had to rule with the help of a council of regents made of three people. </sentence><sentence id="717">One of them was the Mr. Filov who, until that time, was Prime Minister of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> and was responsible for most of the antisemitic actions of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> during that time. </sentence><sentence id="718">The fact that he became a regent and someone else, again from the Fascist party, came to power at least explains the benign neglect towards the Jews, the -- that occurred towards the end of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="719">They were preoccupied with other things and besides, the new Prime Minister, although a Fascist, was not such an ideological fanatic as Mr. Filov who and the other Minister Gabrovski"", Minister of Internal Affairs. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: Of the benign neglect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: Yeh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="843">A: Well, life was getting more hopeful. </sentence><sentence id="844">It was obvious that even the <span class="building">Commissariat for Jewish Affairs</span> did not, did not bother so much about, about supervising every little detail of the -- of life in the Jewish Community of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> and my father being one -- a member of the <span class="building">Consistory</span>, that was a relief because they didn't have to be called up and lectured or abused verbally about the little local commissars. </sentence><sentence id="845">Conversations at <span class="building">home</span> or when visiting friends and relatives, of course, would continue to be conducted on -- with little <span class="spatial object">maps</span> about the War. </sentence><sentence id="846">How we got our information? </sentence><sentence id="847">Apart from newspapers, it was very difficult, but some Jews managed to smuggle -- no, to smuggle themselves into the <span class="building">houses</span> of Bulgarian friends and listen secretly to the BBC and the Voice of America and then, of course, pass it on to the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="848">So we were informed about the, the progress of Allied advances all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="849">And becoming more and more hopeful that if nothing had happened until then, it was obvious that we, we may not be sent to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="850">That fear was lurking all the time. </sentence><sentence id="851">So the prayers were, "Let the Allies arrive as quickly as possible and liberate us." </sentence><sentence id="852">Now we did not know that last minute death marches occurred in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and anything -- a lot of similar things could have happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="853">But you know, when you want to believe, you believe that you may be saved somehow. </sentence><sentence id="854">And things continued improving in winter and spring of deg44. </sentence><sentence id="855">It was felt slowly that <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> was trying to disengage its -- to put more (c) <span class="building">Petur Gabrovski  8</span> and more distance between itself and the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="856">Not by any terribly dramatic overt actions, but simply by, by doing less of, let's say, antisemitic propaganda in the papers. </sentence><sentence id="857">Not rescinding any of the existing laws or regulations, but not introducing new ones. </sentence><sentence id="858">And by end of May of "44, a new government under I think the name is Bagrianov"!came to power. </sentence><sentence id="859">Mr. Bagrianov made a speech at the beginning which sounded very, very encouraging more by what he omitted to say against the Allies or in favor of <span class="country">Germany</span> than by what he said. </sentence><sentence id="860">He organized his government. </sentence><sentence id="861">We began feeling that some of the restrictions were quietly lifted against us, but minor restrictions, like restrictions on movement. </sentence><sentence id="862">For example, the night curfew by that time was quietly dropped -- at least in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, that's what I can speak about. </sentence><sentence id="863">By August -- and I remember the date because it was the date of the speech, the speech of Mr. Bagrianov for the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> about which we knew somehow in advance. </sentence><sentence id="864">We must have gotten the word through a <span class="building">Western Radio station</span> that he will make a major speech. </sentence><sentence id="865">And in that speech he openly started speaking against <span class="country">Germany</span>, about the desire of his government to leave the Axis, about his desire to meet Allied terms, reasonable terms for peace, and about the abolition, the abolition in the new future of all anti-Jewish legislation. </sentence><sentence id="866">And, indeed, by August 30th of the, of the same year, all anti-Jewish laws were rescinded. </sentence><sentence id="867">That was nine or 10 days before the Soviet Army entered <span class="country">Bulgaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="868">Feelers to the Allies for a separate peace were sent out. </sentence><sentence id="869">They didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="870">In the meantime, the Soviet Army was advancing. </sentence><sentence id="871">Several governments were toppled and came to power. </sentence><sentence id="872">The most recent -- on September second -- of <span class="populated place">Muraviev</span>", a very pro-Western, liberal person, who openly declared war on <span class="country">Germany</span>, but did not get any peace offer from anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="873">So, for a few days <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> was at war with all the <span class="country">countries</span> in the world, both with the Allies and with the, with the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="874">Then the Red Army marched into <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> unopposed on September ninth. </sentence><sentence id="875">This coincided with partisans of Bulgarians and among them Jews coming down from the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and taking over power in the major <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="876">I was there when this occurred. </sentence><sentence id="877">I was outside. </sentence><sentence id="878">I don't know why I was on the <span class="dlf">street</span> -- on the main <span class="dlf">street</span>, actually, when the partisans came down from the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, took positions with guns. </sentence><sentence id="879">By that time the Fascist police had totally disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="880">And then some of them, I think, some of the Jewish partisans who could spot the Jewish young boys like me -- I was 14 at the time -- will recruit us on the spot to come with them while searching the <span class="building">homes</span> of prominent Fascists, especially former police chiefs and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="881">I was taken by one young partisans to help him go through the pockets of the just- deposed Chief of Police of <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">It was quite an experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="883">I was shaking, " Tvan Bagrianov " Kosta Muraviev  9 shaking more, more violently than the man himself who knew that he will be shot almost the same day, and I think he was, by the partisans, summarily without any.... But you couldn't blame them knowing what the local police had done against partisans, bombing entire <span class="building">houses</span> with the people in them when they would get word that the partisans were hiding and this again, we eyewitnesses to that. </sentence><sentence id="884">So a personal experience was helping a young partisan while he was holding the gun pointed at the local Chief of Police and I went through his pockets and searched him bodily, him and his wife and his young daughter. </sentence><sentence id="885">Another impression deeply engraved from the same day when the partisans came down -- I remember one Jewish partisan marching into the <span class="building">Consistory</span>, and then at gun point marching out all the members of the entire leadership, including my father. </sentence><sentence id="886">Now, this partisan was a Communist who felt that the previous -- the Jewish leadership who had helped the Jewry -- the local Jewry really survived the impact quite well, but that they were not progressive enough for his taste. </sentence><sentence id="887">This very soon was taken care of because obviously this Jewish partisan was acting on his own, and not with the knowledge of the <span class="populated place">Fatherland Front</span> which was the umbrella organization of all anti- Fascist forces, with the Communist Party, of course, playing a very leading role in it. </sentence><sentence id="888">But it was a wide coalition at that time. </sentence><sentence id="889">And they had -- they were very well informed. </sentence><sentence id="890">They did not consider any Bulgarian Jew as a collaborator of the Fascists. </sentence><sentence id="891">So this was taken -- but it was a very ugly thing for these people, finally on the day of liberation, rejoicing, having kept the spirit, to be marched out as criminals by an over zealous Jewish Communist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: Were you there when that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="948">I remember my father coming out. </sentence><sentence id="949">I was next to them because the <span class="building">home</span> of the former Chief of Police, whom I had helped search, and the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> were very close to each other so after having helped the one partisan in his job, I was already free to go, and went naturally to the Jewish <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">And suddenly I see my father being, being marched out at gunpoint together with the five or six other members of the <span class="building">Consistory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="951">But it lasted very briefly. </sentence><sentence id="952">Apparently, they were just taken to -- I don't know -- to a <span class="building">local headquarters</span> of the partisans and within the hour, they were released with apologies. </sentence><sentence id="953">This was -- but I was very shocked, and very, very deeply hurt, because I knew how we had all prayed for the partisans, for the liberators, for the Allies to come and here we are suddenly again the enemies of the liberators. </sentence><sentence id="954">That was really ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="955">But it was handled properly. </sentence><sentence id="956">That was September 9, 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: How did your family now react? </sentence><sentence id="968">What was happening to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Well, with tremendous joy because obviously we were free again, free to return to <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">A little worried as to what a Soviet occupation of <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> would mean. </sentence><sentence id="973">After all, we had read that and seen movies about life in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="974">The news about the agreements at <span class="populated place">Yalta</span> became finally filtering to us and we began realizing that  0 Europe had been sort of divided into <span class="dlf">spheres</span> and that we unfortunately belonged to the <span class="dlf">sphere</span> that would be under Soviet control. </sentence><sentence id="975">But again the joy of just being free again, of being alive, of having survived it all and of going <span class="building">home</span> soon was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="976">And indeed, within the week, we were already back in <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>, back in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="977">I have no recollections as to how. </sentence><sentence id="978">Oh yes, the previous occupants as very involved with the with the Fascist authorities had escaped, had escaped, and I think they had escaped by the wife pulling out a pistol on a <span class="spatial object">domestic flight</span> and forcing it into <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">Yes, that, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="980">Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="981">So we found our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="982">We did not conduct any religious cleansing services as they did. </sentence><sentence id="983">Maybe we should have, but we were happy to be back and, and with us came the family of my Aunt Lisa, and her two children, and we were only too glad to give them one of the three <span class="interior space">apartments</span> in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="984">The <span class="interior space">third floor</span> became theirs because their <span class="building">house</span> had been demolished by an American incendiary bomb during -- there were two or three bombing attacks on <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> by <span class="spatial object">Allied planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">It was mainly American and one of them was in February, I think, of "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1019">A: Well, in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, of course we, on the date when the Russian Army finally reached <span class="populated place">Pleven</span>, they had, of course, come to -- from <span class="populated place">Rumania</span> and to the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>, through the <span class="env feature">Black Sea</span>, but troops obviously entered every major <span class="populated place">Bulgarian city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1020">We all went out to greet them out of curiosity, but also in a fact they were our liberators. </sentence><sentence id="1021">But at the back of my mind, I remember -- for example, people, Jews -- Jewish people on the eve of the arrival of Soviet troops in <span class="populated place">Pleven</span> would urge each other, "Well, take good care of your jewelry and whatever little gold you have because, you know, you never know with the Soviets." </sentence><sentence id="1022">And in deed, some of the -- now I have not personally seen that or experienced it, but many, many people were telling of the way Russian soldiers, once they arrived and would start marching down the <span class="dlf">streets</span> or become traffic policemen or whatever, would stop people and simply rip their watches off their hands. </sentence><sentence id="1023">They were very, very hungry, if I can use that word, for the basic amenities of the <span class="region">West</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Because, by their standards, <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> was the <span class="region">West</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Other excesses really I have not seen or observed. </sentence><sentence id="1026">They were behaving as a sort of benign occupation army. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Because, after all,  1 <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> did not offer any opposition. </sentence><sentence id="1028">The old Bulgarian gratefulness to the Russian people for their liberation from the Turks back in 1878 is a thread that really passes through Bulgarian history. </sentence><sentence id="1029">No matter what happens, the Bulgarians will never be anti- Russian or even anti-Soviet in the sense that some other <span class="region">Eastern European countries</span> can be, because of that historical indebtedness that Bulgarians feel toward the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1030">There were, were no excesses. </sentence><sentence id="1031">But of course, one could feel the firm grip of the Soviet occupation forces in the sense of organizing the government. </sentence><sentence id="1032">The <span class="region">Fatherland Front</span> was set in place with <span class="building">Parliament</span> what -- in which all of these anti-Fascist forces were represented. </sentence><sentence id="1033">But what gradually started happening from deg44 -- from the end of "44, "45 was a gradual reassertion of the Communist element of that coalition. </sentence><sentence id="1034">The gradual and quiet disappearance of opposition leaders without any explanation. </sentence><sentence id="1035">It transpired that they were liquidated physically, one by one, gradually to the point that by 1947, when elections were held, the Communist Party had already solidified its control over the whole government and the rest of the so-called coalition partners were really figure heads that didn't, didn't count for much. </sentence><sentence id="1036">But that's -- this is already jumping ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1069">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Well, it was a very exciting time to be back at <span class="building">school</span> because after so many years of suppression and oppression as a Jew, this time, we, the Jews -- the few Jewish pupils - - students in every <span class="building">class</span> would feel that we are now in power. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And at the beginning, we indeed felt that way. </sentence><sentence id="1072">We could see how former Fascist or former members of those youth organizations that were there, and we knew how they behaved, cowered in our presence, were afraid that we might denounce them or take some other revenge which we did not. </sentence><sentence id="1073">But it was very pleasant for awhile to feel on top of the world in this case. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Some of us with childish and or youthful enthusiasm and naivete began believing very sincerely in the goals of the <span class="region">Fatherland</span> from this wide coalition of forces opposed to such bad things like Fascism and Imperialism, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1075">We were very quickly disabused from that original idealistic sympathy, because it was obvious who was running the show. </sentence><sentence id="1076">After a while it was obvious that every, even the <span class="populated place">Fatherland Front</span> meeting would ultimately become a session of typically Communist criticism of self criticism. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And we had read enough by that time of Marx literature which was fed to us at <span class="building">school</span> to know that these were purely Communist ideological tools and were not typical of, let's say, the progressive agrarians or some of the other smaller parties that were in the coalition. </sentence><sentence id="1078">A strange phenomenon also began. </sentence><sentence id="1079">A new form of antisemitism based on the revulsion of some even progressive Bulgarians, from some of the ideological and other excesses of  2 Jewish Communists. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And with time, we began -- we Jews ourselves began to be quiet annoyed and in some cases, quite resentful of that attitude. </sentence><sentence id="1081">Well, I will come to that in a few years. </sentence><sentence id="1082">My own experiences in one of those so-called <span class="building">volunteer labor brigades</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: Well. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Actually by "47, I had been for three academic years in <span class="building">school</span> and I graduated because the new government had abolished the so-called eighth grade of <span class="building">high school</span>, which would be equivalent to the American -- well, the last grade of <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1110">So I graduated very young at the age of 17, and, of course, had to think about my higher education. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Now this was already in 1947. </sentence><sentence id="1112">The elections took place, supervised by the Communists, and the Communist Party was returned by 99.9 percent. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I leave it to historians to judge the voracity of those results, but those were the results. </sentence><sentence id="1114">The Communists were firmly in control which meant -- especially to us Jews who were so hungry for Western culture -- especially after the War having -- meaning from the free <span class="region">West</span>, American movies, American books, American magazines, British films and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1115">For a while, for two years, "44, "45, part of "46, we were allowed to watch such movies and to have access to foreign books. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I remember being a member of the <span class="building">British Consul Library</span> and the small <span class="interior space">reading room</span> established by the <span class="building">Youth Information Agency</span> in <span class="populated place">Sofia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1117">By "48, they had been abolished. </sentence><sentence id="1118">But suddenly in "47, one could not see a single American western movie in <span class="populated place">town</span> or an important <span class="building">Western magazine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1120">That was very bothersome to us because it was such an infringement of the newly acquired freedom and a foretaste of things to come -- especially after the Communists had firmly established themselves in power. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And then news from other <span class="region">Eastern European countries</span>, from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> for example, the events, the death of Masaryk" and the overthrow of the last truly democratic government there. </sentence><sentence id="1122">A close friend of mine was the son of the Bulgarian Ambassador to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> during that time so I heard it firsthand as to what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1123">That was in 1947. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I mention this because this fact plus the elections plus the events in the <span class="region">Middle East</span> with the passage of the Partition Resolution of the United Nations in -- was it November of "47? </sentence><sentence id="1125">All of these factors combined within the hearts and minds of Bulgarians Jews, and I felt, like anybody, else that the time to go has arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Now, with the return of the Communist Party to power, the return of Jewish property, which had started in 1944, was stopped and new laws expropriating all property from all Bulgarian citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, was taking place. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So, we saw that in several respects we were even worse off than under the Fascists, under a new Communist legislation. </sentence><sentence id="1128">So the feeling was, "Ifa State of <span class="country">Israel</span> is proclaimed, we should go as quickly as we can." </sentence><sentence id="1129">8 <span class="populated place">Jan Masaryk  3</span> And indeed, that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1130">When the State of <span class="country">Israel</span> was proclaimed in May of 1948, Bulgarian Jews by that time had organized themselves in every conceivable type of Zionist organizations. </sentence><sentence id="1131">The lists of potential immigrants were -- had already been drawn up. </sentence><sentence id="1132">So we were ready and the Bulgarian government received permission from the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, just as the governments of other <span class="region">Eastern European countries</span>, to allow every Jew who wants to leave for <span class="country">Palestine</span> to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I will not go into the rationale for this, for this Soviet policy, but obviously it had some very pragmatic reasons behind it. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Now -- but to go a little bit back again to <span class="dlf">deg47</span>, I became active again in <span class="building">Zionist organizations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I had decided that if | am given the chance to leave for <span class="country">Israel</span> or for <span class="country">Palestine</span>, I would leave. </sentence><sentence id="1136">But in the meantime I had to think of the immediate future, and that was <span class="building">higher education</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1137">To qualify for admission to <span class="building">Sofia University</span>, or any other <span class="building">university</span>, unless you had very good Communist Party credentials, the only other thing that might give you a chance to be considered for admission was to volunteer for service in one of the many labor brigades organized by the government when the young people go to build <span class="dlf">roads</span> or a little <span class="populated place">villages</span> for children and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I participated in one such <span class="populated place">village</span> which we toiled hard to build, but never came to pass, because it was just work for work's sake. </sentence><sentence id="1139">It was just to say that you are doing something. </sentence><sentence id="1140">So I joined a <span class="building">brigade</span> like that and was unfortunate to have as my brigade commandant a Bulgarian Jewish Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1141">He made my life a misery, knowing that I am a Jew, and knowing that I am the son of a prominent lawyer, a non-Communist, somebody who was active during the War and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1142">It was obvious that that class struggle mentality was there as though we, the Jews were enemies of each other. </sentence><sentence id="1143">No Bulgarian Jew had ever exploited any other Bulgarian Jew in order to carry the class struggle to that point. </sentence><sentence id="1144">But that was the ideological predilection of these people. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So he gave me hell during that time. </sentence><sentence id="1146">I remember that and I mention that for one reason: Later on by the time some of the Bulgarian Jewish Communists fell in disfavor with the Bulgarian authorities, especially after the Six Day War in <span class="country">Palestine</span>, this particular man immigrated to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And I saw him in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1148">| ignored him, but others who had suffered under different circumstances gave him a sound beating there. </sentence><sentence id="1149">If he is alive I wish him well in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1201">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="1202">So, the -- from the vote on the Petition of <span class="country">Palestine</span> in the fall of 1947, Bulgarian Jewry was freely aflame with Zionist fervor if I can say so. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I will never forget the manifestations. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Yeh, the march through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Sofia</span> with, with lit candles. </sentence><sentence id="1205">I am trying to remember whether this was the night of the Partition Resolution or the date of the Proclamation of the State. </sentence><sentence id="1206">No, I think it was the Proclamation of the State. </sentence><sentence id="1207">That was something unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1208">In a <span class="country">country</span> already openly ruled by the Communist Party, a spontaneous demonstration, which really the authorities -- although they were officially very anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist with all the permission on the part of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> for  4 Jews to immigrate into <span class="country">Israel</span>, but the official policy was against Zionism because Stalin did not believe in Zionism -- but the Bulgarian authorities allowed us to march in support of the new State of <span class="country">Israel</span> and it was very touching. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And you could see that all these people who are not allowed, or whose little demonstration on May 24, 1943 was crushed, were here marching freely in a <span class="country">Communist country</span> in support of the newly born <span class="country">State of Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1210">A memorable evening! </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1211">A: Now already in, in late "47, a lot of Jews began immigrating to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, taking the risk of being stopped by <span class="spatial object">British ships</span> and diverted to <span class="country">Cyprus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Even relatives of mine did that, and lived in -- on <span class="country">Cyprus</span> for almost, what -- seven months until the establishment of the <span class="country">State of Israel</span>, when the <span class="dlf">borders</span> opened. </sentence><sentence id="1213">So Bulgarian Jewish immigration began already in "47. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Primarily younger people but some young families as well. </sentence><sentence id="1215">The mass aliyah"* -- the mass immigration, began really one day after the establishment of the <span class="region">State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Already on May 16, Bulgarian Jews were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Of course, <span class="spatial object">aliyah</span> depended on the transportation capabilities of the young <span class="region">State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Strangely enough within a few months, two major <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were already put at the disposal of Bulgarian Jews for immigration: The <span class="spatial object">Pan York</span>, the <span class="dlf">Pan Crescent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1219">I came on the -- to <span class="country">Israel</span> on the <span class="dlf">Pan Crescent</span> in December of 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Within a period of -- a period from let's say June of "48 through February, March of "49, all 48,000 or more of the surviving Bulgarian Jews -- obviously, they all survived World War Two -- immigrated to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1221">A very small number of Jews, either Communists or very old people, people who did not feel that transplanting themselves at that point in their lives would be advisable, stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And this in itself was amazing to see: an entire <span class="populated place">community</span> which had lived for most of the time very peacefully and in prosperity almost 500 years among, in the <span class="region">Balkans</span>, among Bulgarian Slavs, suddenly transplanting itself to the <span class="region">Middle East</span> and starting a new life in the newly re-born State of <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: It was exhilarating in some aspects, but very worrying in others. </sentence><sentence id="1289">The reason being primarily that until we arrived there in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I had not heard about the <span class="dlf">Gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1290">Of two other groups of young Bulgarian Jews who had arrived in <span class="country">Israel</span> on previous <span class="spatial object">ships</span>, and who apparently with a minimum of training, almost none, and with a minimum of arms had been sent on a particular day, on the afternoon as I understand it, to <span class="populated place">Latrun</span> in so- called triangle between -- halfway between the <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, a very strategic place of tremendous importance in the attempts of the young State to stop the onslaught of the five Arab armies that had invaded <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1291">In this case, of course, the main threat was the Egyptian Army, and I think the purpose was not to allow them to make -- to break through it -- <span class="populated place">Latrun</span> -- in order to converge with other invading Arab armies. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Reinforcements apparently were not available. </sentence><sentence id="1293">Ben-Gurion"*, Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief at the time had to make a very, very fateful decision of using these young Bulgarian new arrivals almost as gun fodder by sending them there and trying to use them to just hold the <span class="building">fort</span> until proper reinforcement would arrive. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Well, they did held the <span class="building">fort</span>; <span class="populated place">Latrun</span> was not lost. </sentence><sentence id="1295">It was saved, but all of them lost their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Again, I may be mistaken, but I think the number reached 600. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Well, you can imagine to a 17 year old, when you are told all of this and obviously a fact that had happened several weeks prior to your own arrival in <span class="country">Israel</span>, you really don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1298">You don't have the benefit of your parents" counsel. </sentence><sentence id="1299">You listen to what the other guys tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1300">This guy was telling me, "Well, if you don't want to end up this way, try to somehow join the <span class="building">Air Force</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1301">He had, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And I will not go into the details of how I managed to get into a force that was exclusively volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="1303">There is a Hebrew word for that Mahal, a abbreviation for "Mitnadevei Hutz La" Aretz,"(r)" "Volunteers from Overseas." </sentence><sentence id="1304">But Mahal meant the people from English speaking or other affluent <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1305">All of us who came from <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> were known as the category of <span class="populated place">Gahal</span>, "Ge'us Hutz La'Aretz,"" "Conscripted from Overseas." </sentence><sentence id="1306">We were conscripted, they were volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Well, some how with the help of the little English that I knew at that time, I did join the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I was privileged to be a member of the first course in the history of the Jewish people for radar technicians and I became one of <span class="country">Israel</span>, <span class="country">Israel</span>'s Air Force's first radio technicians using naval radar equipment for detecting <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1309">But that part of it was very exciting being amongst so many young Jews from all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And especially getting to know American and British and Australian English speaking young Jews, and see that: the depth of their commitment, of their volunteerism, of their Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="1311">I am bearing in "S <span class="populated place">David Ben-Gurion</span> "(c) Foreign volunteers (Hebrew) " Foreign draftees (Hebrew)  7 mind all the time that they came there out of choice. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Most of us came from <span class="country">Bulgaria</span> also out of deliberate Zionist choice, but we also at the back of my mind --of our minds, we had the lack of future under the Communism. </sentence><sentence id="1313">But these young, young people did have a choice, and they still decided to come. </sentence><sentence id="1314">So, it was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1315">The beginnings of a culture if you wish, cross-fertilization with other, with other parts of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1316">For us -- especially Bulgarian Jews who had been raised in the European Sephardic tradition with a very small Ashkenazi minority -- that was the first really contact with Jews that were different from us and we had to make a lot of cultural and emotional adjustments. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1353">A: Yeh. </sentence><sentence id="1354">The Bulgarian community arrived at the time when the formerly Arab town of <span class="populated place">Jaffa</span>, which is almost adjacent to <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span>, because of the flight of its inhabitants at the height of the fighting during the War of Liberation, was virtually empty. </sentence><sentence id="1355">The abandoned <span class="dlf">Arab property</span> was put under the custodian of <span class="dlf">absentee property</span> and was available for new immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So around the time that the Bulgarian aliyah immigration wave was at its height, <span class="populated place">Jaffa</span> was almost empty and open for resettlement. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And that is where I would say the majority of the Bulgarian Jews, at least 20 to 25,000 settled at first. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And pretty soon, <span class="populated place">Jaffa</span> became a <span class="populated place">Bulgarian city</span>, with Bulgarian signs on <span class="building">shops</span> with Bulgarian translation on movies and began to thrive. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Very few Bulgarian Jews remained in the <span class="populated place">immigration transition camps</span>, <span class="populated place">Mahanot Olim</span>"*, in Hebrew, where people from other <span class="country">countries</span> sometimes stayed for two, three years before they could find their own way out and had to rely on the Jewish agency or government assistance. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Bulgarian Jews very quickly took care of themselves, primarily by settling in places like, like <span class="populated place">Jaffa</span> or <span class="populated place">Lydda</span>, another <span class="populated place">Arab town</span>, which population had fled the <span class="country">country</span> or <span class="populated place">Ramla</span>, another <span class="populated place">Arab town</span> so these were newly created Bulgarian Jewish communities. </sentence><sentence id="1361">Very enterprising and self- reliant with, with many craftsmen and artisans and people of free professions like lawyers, engineers and doctors among them. </sentence><sentence id="1362">The Bulgarians did very well for themselves, and after awhile began leaving those original <span class="region">areas</span>, like <span class="populated place">Jaffa</span>, <span class="populated place">Ramla</span> and <span class="populated place">Lydda</span>, and settling in the more affluent <span class="region">areas</span> of <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> or <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> or <span class="populated place">Haifa</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
