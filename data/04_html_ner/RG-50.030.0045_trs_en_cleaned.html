<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh, tell me about when you uh, what were the circumstances in which you were taken overseas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Well, we went, we [were] inducted in the Army, in the Armed Forces, in 1942, uh, late in "42, in November, and we maneuvered in <span class="region">Louisiana</span> and <span class="region">Texas</span> for approximately a year, uh, a little over a year, and, uh, we, uh, then went to <span class="region">Texas</span> and the <span class="env feature">plains</span> of dry, plains of <span class="region">Texas</span> near <span class="populated place">Abilene</span>, at <span class="populated place">Camp Barkley</span> and then we went to the <span class="env feature">desert</span> to get desert training at Patton's <span class="building">desert training center</span>, which is now a national monument. </sentence><sentence id="56">And in those days it was bleak, dreary, miles of endless wastes, and typical of <span class="region">North Africa</span> where we thought we might go. </sentence><sentence id="57">However that war ended before we got there. </sentence><sentence id="58">So we trained in the <span class="country">States</span> until September of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="59">And then we shipped from <span class="region">California</span> to <span class="populated place">Camp Kilmer</span>, <span class="region">New Jersey</span>; and from there to <span class="country">England</span>, because the 12th Armored Division had taken our equipment. </sentence><sentence id="60">We were landed in <span class="country">England</span> instead of directly in on the continent. </sentence><sentence id="61">Then from <span class="country">England</span> we got trans-shipped to the continent. </sentence><sentence id="62">And we landed at <span class="populated place">Cherbourg</span>, and we started to track east towards the, uh, <span class="region">fighting front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">And about the time we got there--December 16th, 1944--is when the Battle of the Bulge started. </sentence><sentence id="64">So we were thrown into the Battle of the Bulge, and that was our first baptismal of fire. </sentence><sentence id="65">And, uh, first couple of days we lost hundreds and hundreds of men, wounded and killed. </sentence><sentence id="66">Approximately 300 killed and a couple of thousand wounded. </sentence><sentence id="67">And, uh, from there we went to the <span class="dlf">Siegfried Line</span> after crossing the <span class="env feature">Rhine River</span>, and we traveled across <span class="country">Europe</span>, uh, like vagabonds, thirty miles at a time. </sentence><sentence id="68">We'd stop and wait for the rest of the infantry to catch up. </sentence><sentence id="69">We were in an <span class="building">armored division</span> which would go thirty miles in a day easily whereas an <span class="building">infantry division</span> were lucky to go three or four miles in a day. </sentence><sentence id="70">So we were always ahead of our, uh, <span class="spatial object">support units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">We had infantry in our own units, which defended the people who were, uh, in spear-heading as we called it. </sentence><sentence id="72">And, uh, we travelled across Europe, uh, for, uh, weeks at a time and towards the end of the war was just a continual pack, pick-up, pack-up, dig-in, pack-up and go, go, go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Was the fighting very heavy at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="94">The German people, the Volksturm and the SS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="95">If they didn't shoot at us, they would shoot the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="96">And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS, uh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of <span class="country">Germany</span>, and, uh, the, well, you know, this went on a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="97">I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe, uh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="98">The, uh, thing that I remember was we started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here and a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the, uh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents. </sentence><sentence id="99">And sometimes the <span class="env feature">hillsides</span> would be covered with bodies of the Americans, or a <span class="dlf">hillside</span> would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in, <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> inmates or, uh, slaves on <span class="dlf">farms</span>, they would, uh, march them ahead of  them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently. </sentence><sentence id="100">Anduh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Did you see any of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="112">These bodies were lying along the <span class="dlf">roadsides</span> where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war. </sentence><sentence id="113">From April 15th to the end of the war we saw this in many places and, uh, uh, the, uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Was that your first contact with <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> victims? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the <span class="building">11th Armored Division</span>, and I was in the <span class="building">56th Engineers</span>, and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your shoulder and, uh, there there were several <span class="building">armored divisions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were one of them. </sentence><sentence id="122">The <span class="building">4th Armored</span> was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until and then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the <span class="region">lands</span> that we had just over-run. </sentence><sentence id="123">And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been walking ahead of us for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="124">We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who had been, uh, uh, had died along the <span class="dlf">roadsides</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And by the hundreds in some cases, and then just here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted attempts because they took too much time to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="126">They were trying to hide the, the ones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="155">Translate. </sentence><sentence id="156">What is <span class="building">CCB</span>...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<span class="dlf">trench</span> in between with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> over the <span class="dlf">trench</span> and, uh, the the security that they had to provide for themselves to keep these people from climbing over the <span class="dlf">wall</span> to get at them. </sentence><sentence id="608">And, uh, they had <span class="spatial object">machine gun nests</span> at every corner of the <span class="dlf">walls</span> overlooking the compound, and, uh, the other thing I couldn't get over was how the people were all out in the sun trying to sun themselves because they were confined in the <span class="building">barracks</span> a lot of them and they weren't even out working anymore. </sentence><sentence id="609">They were just kept in the <span class="building">barracks</span> and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread and it was a real mess. </sentence><sentence id="610">Everything was smelly. </sentence><sentence id="611">There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they were doing it out in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they had, which wasn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="612">And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in, having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them. </sentence><sentence id="613">Uh, I was quite stricken, uh, stricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women were the last things to apparently go because they looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="614">The women's breasts had  2 shrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal. </sentence><sentence id="615">And the men's penises and testicles were about normal. </sentence><sentence id="616">And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin stretched over them. </sentence><sentence id="617">And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, is the condition of, of the things that are needed to reproduce life. </sentence><sentence id="618">They're the last things to go, as far as I could see. </sentence><sentence id="619">In other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs. </sentence><sentence id="620">It was the one thing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them. </sentence><sentence id="621">And as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the <span class="dlf">graves</span> fast enough so we got our <span class="spatial object">bulldozers</span> to dig the <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the Germans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the <span class="dlf">trenches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">Well we'd have been there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand. </sentence><sentence id="623">We did dig a few <span class="dlf">trenches</span> by hand, but we then used the <span class="spatial object">bulldozers</span> because there were so many. </sentence><sentence id="624">They had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="625">They couldn't dig the <span class="dlf">graves</span> fast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle them. </sentence><sentence id="626">They put them down in the <span class="dlf">graves</span> and laid them side by side and then they would throw a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the <span class="spatial object">bulldozer</span>, as Al pushed the, uh, stone and sand back into the <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the bones of the poor bodies down below. </sentence><sentence id="627">It was, because this was <span class="dlf">backfill</span> for the <span class="dlf">soccer field</span> was made out of <span class="dlf">backfill</span> and from the <span class="dlf">quarry</span> and there were a lot of hard stones mixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were laid to rest in that, uh, <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="628">After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the <span class="populated place">upper camp</span>--see this was down at the <span class="interior space">lower level</span>, the <span class="dlf">sports field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="629">Then there was another <span class="interior space">lower level</span> down around on the <span class="dlf">quarry level</span> and, uh, there's now a third <span class="dlf">graveyard</span> up on the top where the, uh, the old <span class="building">barracks</span> used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of the <span class="populated place">camp.</span> </sentence><sentence id="630">The <span class="dlf">stone wall</span> is gone now that was in between, the <span class="dlf">electrified fences</span> are long gone and shortly after we got most of the people into <span class="building">medical tents</span> away from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> even. </sentence><sentence id="631">We moved them out into <span class="building">field hospitals</span>; we burned the <span class="building">buildings</span> down because they were that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no place, no la...no facilities for <span class="building">latrines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">They had these <span class="dlf">ditches</span> in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and when the rains came, it would wash everything down the <span class="env feature">hillside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">So all that's gone now and it's, it's a <span class="dlf">graveyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="634">They said they moved the bodies from that <span class="dlf">sports field</span> or <span class="dlf">soccer field</span> but when I went back in 1975 the <span class="env feature">trees</span> had grown over it already in 35 years. </sentence><sentence id="635">I went there 35 years later and, uh, the, it was so changed. </sentence><sentence id="636">It was a big <span

exhibit. </sentence><sentence id="639">But the huge <span class="building">barracks</span> down below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up for other purposes. </sentence><sentence id="640">But we did burn most of the <span class="building">barracks</span> in the <span class="region">upper part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="641">We left a few in the front which apparently were the cleanest. </sentence><sentence id="642">And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the Austrian civilians had a dinner for us. </sentence><sentence id="643">They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a <span class="spatial object">limousine</span> and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us. </sentence><sentence id="644">We were like heroes. </sentence><sentence id="645">And the people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were grabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various outfits. </sentence><sentence id="646">These are unit insignia. </sentence><sentence id="647">Here's the <span class="building">41st Cavalry</span> which happens to be the unit that was the first ones in the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="648">And this Michael Green who was in the 41st Cavalry is going back to Europe this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing  3 some of these along to give to the people for souvenirs. </sentence><sentence id="649">But, uh, we were back again in 1980 and we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and we meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the survivors of <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there. </sentence><sentence id="650">And I guess maybe un another couple of hundred died and so there were 11,000 actual people alive when we got there, but the ones coming back are the families of the victims who died in <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="651">They come back by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="652">But we were back in 1975 there were around 12,000 people there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every <span class="dlf">road</span> was full of these big, uh, <span class="spatial object">tourists bus</span> that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, <span class="spatial object">cars</span> around a <span class="building">football stadium</span> in the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="653">Incredible where they come from <span class="country">Spain</span> and <span class="country">Hungary</span>, <span class="country">Hungaria</span>--all the countries of Europe and, uh, we were, as I said, when they found out we were the liberators they couldn't do enough for us. </sentence><sentence id="654">They practically tore the, they wanted our hats; they wanted, they were going to tear the clothes off us. </sentence><sentence id="655">We were real celebrities. </sentence><sentence id="656">So I felt good about that and I'm; I just felt so sad about all those that were killed, over a hundred twenty thousand were killed in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="657">Or more. </sentence><sentence id="658">They're not sure. </sentence><sentence id="659">It's between a hundred twenty, hundred fifty thousand that they know of. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Well, nothing except that it was made so the people couldn't get out, and as I said it looked like a <span class="building">prison</span> when we first observed it, and it was more like a <span class="building">prison</span> when you got in it, uh, because they don't have the double <span class="dlf">electrified fences</span>. </sentence><sentence id="716">Our <span class="building">prisons</span> have <span class="dlf">fences</span>, but not electrified, and, uh, the, uh, condition of the people--the human skeletons walking around was another thing that impressed me. </sentence><sentence id="717">As I said the, uh, that anybody could be alive and that thin when they looked like bones, their legs, their arms, their feet looked swollen in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="718">That was the only thing that looked anywheres near normal was from their ankles down to their insteps. </sentence><sentence id="719">Uh, the rest of the bodies were, uh, skin drawn over their faces as if it were shrunk in the heat or whatever--just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="720">And I don't know what else to say...the smells as I said were terrible, but I wasn't too fazed by that for some reason, and I think it was because of my upbringing on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Oh, as I said, we started to burn some of the <span class="building">buildings</span> and, uh, the, uh, we backfilled the  4 <span class="dlf">trenches</span> and the <span class="interior space">latrines</span> and most of the people were gone. </sentence><sentence id="748">The ones who could walk started walking <span class="building">home</span> within a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="749">And, uh, the ones who were very sick we moved out into <span class="building">field hospitals</span> and, uh, some of those that stayed were trying to help us get the records to find out and to check on how many people were killed and to keep track of everything and we had some of the people working there because they didn't want to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="750">A lot of them were Russians and they didn't want to go back to to <span class="country">Russia</span>, so, uh, we tried to keep them, uh, working in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and they, because the they said if we go back to <span class="country">Russia</span> it will be the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="751">And it was we found out later. </sentence><sentence id="752">They were sent to the <span class="dlf">salt mines</span>, to <span class="region">Siberia</span> in other words, and, uh, that was something that I didn't think of until just now, but, uh, they were glad to be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="753">They didn't want to go back to <span class="country">Russia</span> and we, they, uh, incidentally from after we let the, as I say, uh, should say, we took the demolitions off the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> in <span class="populated place">Linz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="754">Our group, our engineers were then sent out into, uh, north of <span class="building">CCB</span> and the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and thousands, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and White Russians tried to surrender to us. </sentence><sentence id="755">And we accepted their surrender, and, uh, in place, but they wanted to come into <span class="country">Germany</span> you know, on our side of the <span class="dlf">line</span> because they didn't want to be anywheres near the Russians and unfortunately our politicians had said this is the <span class="dlf">line</span> of demarcation and all those Russians on that side, I mean Germans, will have to go back to the Russians and so a couple of hundred thousand soldiers that surrendered to us were returned to the Germans [Russians] and shipped to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">But that was, that was the 6th of May. </sentence><sentence id="757">In fact it was the afternoon of the Sth, the 6th and the 7th, and on about the 8th I got to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and I was there on and off for a couple of days, but the main part was when we got the the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> or <span class="dlf">trenches</span> dug for the <span class="dlf">graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">That was my main job there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
