<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"><span class="building">SAM SPIEGeL</span> May 3, 1995 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is Samuel Spiegel. </sentence><sentence id="3">I was born in , <span class="country">Poland</span> on August the 23rd, 1922. </sentence><sentence id="4">I had three more sisters and a brother. </sentence><sentence id="5">I was the oldest one. </sentence><sentence id="6">We had a <span class="building">shoe factory</span> at <span class="building">home</span>, and my mother passed away in childbirth and I was four years old. </sentence><sentence id="7">Then my father remarried a year later. </sentence><sentence id="8">We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="9">I wouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. </sentence><sentence id="10">We lived pretty nicely. </sentence><sentence id="11">Then when the war broke out in 1939 it was September Ist a bomb fell into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was about 7:00 in the morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes before, and nobody got hurt. </sentence><sentence id="13">But, this was only the beginning because the minute the Germans came in, things started to get very bad for us. </sentence><sentence id="14">It was September when <span class="building">school</span> starts again, and Jewish kids were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="15">But, the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> opened up some little <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> that the kids went to so they can learn a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="16">In 1940, the middle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give away all the jewelry and all the furs that all the people had, and we gave everything away, but we thought it's a war, maybe they need it and things are going to get a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="17">Things started getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: Actually, I just want to go back a little bit before you describe the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">A little more background, was your family religious and also before the war did you mingle with Polish kids or did you feel any anti semitism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Before the war, I went to <span class="building">school</span>, which was a <span class="building">public school</span>, but there were very few Jewish kids in our class of 55 kids, there were about six Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="39">They must sit on one side, the left side of the class. </sentence><sentence id="40">Mostly it was a <span class="building">catholic school</span> and prayers were said every morning and every night before we went <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">We just stood there, but the Jewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. </sentence><sentence id="42">We mixed with the friends that I had in <span class="building">school</span>, but socially we hadn't mixed. </sentence><sentence id="43">Sometimes when they needed some help, some <span class="building">school</span> help, they used to come to my <span class="building">house</span>, and I used to help them out a little bit, but otherwise, they had different friends and we had different friends. </sentence><sentence id="44">Because I went to <span class="building">school</span> from early in the morning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="45">2:00 we used to come <span class="building">home</span> and have our main meal. </sentence><sentence id="46">Then I used to go to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> to learn religion. </sentence><sentence id="47">I usually didn't come <span class="building">home</span> until about 6:00 in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then, at night my father was very active and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go to a <span class="building">Hebrew School</span> which was called a <span class="building">Tabut</span>, and that's usually how my schooling was, because when the war broke out, I was about 16 1/2 close to 17 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: So your family was religious and involved in Jewish activity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like conservative. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: He was involved in political organizations? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: A little bit. </sentence><sentence id="66">| was younger. </sentence><sentence id="67">I don't remember exactly, but I know he was involved in organizations quite a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: Did you ever experience any attacks or any --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their <span class="dlf">doors</span> because what they preached mostly in the <span class="building">churches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">When they come <span class="building">home</span> and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: No, we were aware very little of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: How large was your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Our <span class="populated place">town</span> had about close to 10,000 population. </sentence><sentence id="83">4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: Business and that was fairly integrated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your <span class="populated place">town</span> and bomb fell on your <span class="building">house</span>, what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: September the Ist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Yes, what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: We ran out from the <span class="building">house</span>, then we had to get another place to live. </sentence><sentence id="97">I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little while in a <span class="interior space">room</span> just to stay until things straightened a little bit out. </sentence><sentence id="98">Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate <span class="interior space">room</span> and nobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. </sentence><sentence id="99">Then I worked for the <span class="building">Jewish Community Center</span> at <span class="building">home</span>, because the Germans, when they made the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, made like the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the <span class="building">office</span> over there for them, until I sent away to , to the <span class="populated place">slave labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">Things got very bad in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">There was a lot of sickness, a lot of poverty. </sentence><sentence id="102">We didn't get enough food to eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as much as we could as a community. </sentence><sentence id="103">Because we still lived in our own <span class="building">homes</span>, and we had  some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even had a paper that I could go outside of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, because I worked in the <span class="building">office</span> and I worked in the <span class="building">labor department</span>, in that <span class="region">section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">I could see what started going on and I was very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too long, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, this was before they took all the Jewish people out from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">The fellow that took me out from there was an SS man by the name of . </sentence><sentence id="106">He said we have to go to , because there's a big <span class="building">ammunition factory</span> and we'll have to send a lot of people over there to work. </sentence><sentence id="107">We have to go over and see how things are set up over there. </sentence><sentence id="108">When I came over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said Monday maybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to go back anymore because all the Jewish people from your <span class="populated place">town</span> were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="109">That's how I stayed over there. </sentence><sentence id="110">All the time I was in for about two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, what you all did? </sentence><sentence id="128">Was it closed in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: It was closed in <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">You couldn't go in, you couldn't get out unless you had a special paper from the German government. </sentence><sentence id="133">The SS used to come in every day to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, take people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were doing it, and we even had a little <span class="building">hospital</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="134">A lot of people that got sick and had typhus, they took them out and they shoot them, they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="135">Also, I remember when they came in one day and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they said they need about 25 men and 25 women because they had to take them away to a <span class="building">factory</span> somewhere to work. </sentence><sentence id="136">They took them into a <span class="building">public bath house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">They gave them a <span class="interior space">bath</span> and they shaved their hair and everything else and they send them away. </sentence><sentence id="138">We found out later that they took them away to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> that they tried out the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> on them. </sentence><sentence id="139">This was a try out. </sentence><sentence id="140">We couldn't believe that those things are happening, but later on we found out that they were true. </sentence><sentence id="141">There was gas put into the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">Life was very difficult in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">You couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="144">There was no work. </sentence><sentence id="145">Nobody was working except when the Germans took you out to work somewhere on the outside, but you still used to come <span class="building">home</span> at night and be with your family. </sentence><sentence id="146">That was one good thing about it. </sentence><sentence id="147">You always had hope. </sentence><sentence id="148">You figured it's a war, maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="149">Maybe things are going to change. </sentence><sentence id="150">We also felt that we have to stick together in order to keep each other alive and maybe things are going to change a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: What about activities in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, cultural activities, religion, your father's political -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="174">You were afraid even to go out into the <span class="dlf">street</span> during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come <span class="building">home</span>, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could. </sentence><sentence id="175">They used to come in every day to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and do what they want to, and a lot of people got killed. </sentence><sentence id="176">If they didn't like somebody, they just killed them in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">It didn't make any  difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Did you see that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Oh, sure, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="186">I remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="187">He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used to call him. </sentence><sentence id="188">He was a very, very cruel man. </sentence><sentence id="189">He just came out. </sentence><sentence id="190">I remember right near our <span class="building">house</span> there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">We were sitting inside. </sentence><sentence id="192">We were afraid even to go out. </sentence><sentence id="193">So those things were going on daily. </sentence><sentence id="194">It was a daily occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="195">It wasn't new. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Did your father keep up any this organizing <span class="interior space">underground</span>, the Zionism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="210">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="211">In the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> without help from the outside, it was very hard to organize anything, especially in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> like ours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Did you observe <span class="spatial object">shobot</span>, holidays, anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: We used to observe it in the way we could. </sentence><sentence id="218">I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war. </sentence><sentence id="219">If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive. </sentence><sentence id="220">I used to help a little bit because I worked in the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it <span class="building">home</span> instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Tell me a little about the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span>, how you got that job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span>, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="228">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the <span class="building">Judenaut</span> and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. </sentence><sentence id="229">I brought it <span class="building">home</span>, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: What other privileges did you get from working there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="building">home</span>, and I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, if I had to go out for something. </sentence><sentence id="236">If you get out from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, because you mix with the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Were you able to help your family by virtue of your position other than the food? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No, not much. </sentence><sentence id="239">I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the <span class="building">firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">But what happened, the day before they took all the Jews from our <span class="populated place">town</span>, he came <span class="building">home</span>, the night before. </sentence><sentence id="241">He was caught in the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and he was taken away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Was your Judenaut appointed by the <span class="populated place">local community</span> or by the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Mostly by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="249">They picked one man, and then he picked everybody that he wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="250">Some people that he knew or were close friends of his. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: You hear stories about <span class="building">Judenauts</span> and various <span class="populated place">communities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">Some of them were very helpful to the <span class="populated place">community</span>, some of them were trying to save their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="256">How do you kind of assess how your Judenaut operated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: We knew it was a very difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="261">You have to understand what was going on in those days. </sentence><sentence id="262">You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do. </sentence><sentence id="263">If they came in and saw the President of the <span class="building">Judenaut</span>, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to supply those 200 people. </sentence><sentence id="264">So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take me? </sentence><sentence id="265">Why not take somebody else? </sentence><sentence id="266">You're put in the position that if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right. </sentence><sentence id="267">I'm sure that you heard that , which was the President, committed suicide because he knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="268">Some people were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="269">They did what they had to do and they made a lot of enemies. </sentence><sentence id="270">In my opinion they really helped a lot of people, too. </sentence><sentence id="271">But you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of people you remember the bad things what a lot of people do. </sentence><sentence id="272">I couldn't say that I think most of them didn't want to do what they did, but they had to do because they were forced to do, because if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would lose their life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Now, you worked in the <span class="building">labor department</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="289">The <span class="building">labor department</span>, for instance, the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="290">They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to <span class="building">work</span> tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the <span class="spatial object">register</span> that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day. </sentence><sentence id="291">I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work. </sentence><sentence id="292">I worked in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: But how were those choices made, which 200? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: They usually were made according the list that we had. </sentence><sentence id="301">The way the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top of them. </sentence><sentence id="302">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="303">I was 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="304">I didn't make the big decisions. </sentence><sentence id="305">They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those  people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="315">I mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. </sentence><sentence id="316">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="317">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier. </sentence><sentence id="318">I imagine everybody did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="319">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them. </sentence><sentence id="320">If I could help somebody else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Were there women in the <span class="building">Judenaut</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: No, not too many that I can remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the <span class="spatial object">Judenaut</span> toward other people because of their special power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="335">There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: The <span class="building">Judenaut</span> also took care of food and everything else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="341">They used to dispense the food. </sentence><sentence id="342">They used to get it, and then divide it. </sentence><sentence id="343">The people used to have little <span class="spatial object">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week. </sentence><sentence id="344">We also had <span class="interior space">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: Anything else about the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> that you can think of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: The <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was outside, that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take you to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="353">They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job. </sentence><sentence id="354">We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right. </sentence><sentence id="355">So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> because the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="356">You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on. </sentence><sentence id="357">We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: So, you were already in ? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the <span class="interior space">building section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">It was a very, very big place. </sentence><sentence id="361">We lived right in the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">It was like a whole <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">It was one of the largest <span class="building">ammunition factories</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">That's where I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and men were in the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">We lived in separate <span class="building">barracks</span>, but we were in the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was really watched by a Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="367">The Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">It was pretty tough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. </sentence><sentence id="369">We worked but we mixed with other nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="370">The Polish people worked in the same <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">At night time we used to come <span class="building">home</span> and still see our friends and everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="372">We tried to help each other as much as we can. </sentence><sentence id="373">Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the outside and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="374">We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="populated place">camp</span> over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us. </sentence><sentence id="376">I know when they took us away to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and told them that , We were very good workers and we know the ammunition, that we worked in the <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, and they should send us to work in the <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">They did. </sentence><sentence id="378">Very few of our people, except the older ones were taken away to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">The rest of us we got numbers and we were sent away to work. </sentence><sentence id="380">I wasn't in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> really too long. </sentence><sentence id="381">I was over there maybe three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="382">When we came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, by the old <span class="spatial object">conductor trains</span>, the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, the <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span>, a lot of our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't remember exactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days, but we didn't have any food. </sentence><sentence id="383">We didn't have any <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">They didn't give us anything. </sentence><sentence id="385">We didn't have any facilities even in the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and because we were people that already came from another <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> with us, or any valuables. </sentence><sentence id="387">They chased us out from there and we went through the <span class="spatial object">showers</span>, and luckily it was <span class="spatial object">showers</span> and not gas. </sentence><sentence id="388">We came out from there and they numbered us and they put us in <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">Then, people came in from <span class="building">factories</span> because the Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> and they needed people to replace them at their <span class="building">factories</span>, so they needed workers. </sentence><sentence id="390">So they came in from the <span class="building">factory</span>, this is from the <span class="building">train factory</span> and they said they need sheet metal men. </sentence><sentence id="391">I didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of Coopersmith. </sentence><sentence id="392">He passed away, he survived and lived in <span class="region">California</span> and they said Sam, when they ask for sheet metal men, why don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal man. </sentence><sentence id="393">You're very handy, you'll go with me. </sentence><sentence id="394">We'll see that you do something, but God's will they picked him and sent him to a <span class="dlf">coal mine</span> and they sent me into <span class="country">Germany</span> to work in the <span class="building">train factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I didn't know what to do, but then I tried to take the <span class="spatial object">broom</span> and keep the <span class="building">shop</span> very clean, which it was a very big <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">There was about 6,000 people working over there, but our <span class="dlf">section</span> had maybe 30 people working, 35, in the <span class="interior space">sheet metal section</span>, and there were three Germans that were running it, so because I kept the place clean, so they figured everything is fine. </sentence><sentence id="397">They took  a liking to me. </sentence><sentence id="398">I learned a little bit of trade over there. </sentence><sentence id="399">By the end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the <span class="country">United States</span> and the Russians started progressing more on <span class="country">Germany</span>, and the Germans used to have their <span class="building">shops</span> on the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> in <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and they bunked a lot of those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, they brought a lot of our men to the <span class="building">train factory</span> to be fixed. </sentence><sentence id="400">The soldiers that were in those <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, came with them. </sentence><sentence id="401">They usually waited until the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were fixed, so they put on another shift. </sentence><sentence id="402">Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in. </sentence><sentence id="403">His name was Fox. </sentence><sentence id="404">He said, each one he assigned us a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, a pullman to go out and check on those pullman. </sentence><sentence id="405">I went out to mine because I didn't know the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix. </sentence><sentence id="406">When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift. </sentence><sentence id="407">I couldn't tell the men. </sentence><sentence id="408">I took the bull by the horn. </sentence><sentence id="409">I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. </sentence><sentence id="410">We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked. </sentence><sentence id="411">Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. </sentence><sentence id="412">They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">That's where I learned my trade. </sentence><sentence id="414">When I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a <span class="building">shop</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington DC</span> and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the <span class="country">United States</span> when I came over here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, these <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">Your interaction with the other people, with the guards, what your daily life was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: In <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> we didn't have any interaction with the guards. </sentence><sentence id="476">You're very, very scared of them. </sentence><sentence id="477">I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="478">I worked in the <span class="building">sheet metal shop</span>, and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to find, other things, some rings. </sentence><sentence id="479">I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. </sentence><sentence id="480">I was called one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my number and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="481">Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: This is which <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">And I already knew what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="493">I figured my gosh how can I get out of it. </sentence><sentence id="494">I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that , which means they are materials they use during the war for war materials, because I used copper. </sentence><sentence id="495">So, I made the decision that when the main commandment came out, we had appeals every morning that we stayed out. </sentence><sentence id="496">I had to come because the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted us almost all the time. </sentence><sentence id="497">I went out and I went down to the main man behind him and I told him that I was making something for him for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="498">I said I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I worked for it for almost two  weeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. </sentence><sentence id="499">It went away, I never heard any thing more about it. </sentence><sentence id="500">They never called me. </sentence><sentence id="501">The commander got to know me very well because we went out through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> a lot of times. </sentence><sentence id="502">He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out. </sentence><sentence id="503">That's how I survived from going to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> one time. </sentence><sentence id="504">We had to think sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="505">When the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> was liquidated, my whole family went to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, and they all perished in the <span class="building">crematorium</span> in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="506">That's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there. </sentence><sentence id="507">So, I was the only one from the whole family left, from the immediate family, but I had some friends that they brought in from my <span class="populated place">town</span> to , too, and they worked over there. </sentence><sentence id="508">So, we used to meet every day. </sentence><sentence id="509">I think in there must have been about 2,000 or a little bit over 2,000 people over there working. </sentence><sentence id="510">Things were tough. </sentence><sentence id="511">We didn't have enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="512">There was sicknesses. </sentence><sentence id="513">I had two friends by the name, one of them, that he was sick one of them was and the other one was , and they took them all out one day and they shot them all. </sentence><sentence id="514">They liquidated the whole <span class="building">hospital</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="515">They took everything out. </sentence><sentence id="516">So, you can imagine how we felt. </sentence><sentence id="517">Things were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="518">I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that were going on over there, but that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="519">They took them all out and shot them at one day. </sentence><sentence id="520">Plus the other things that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="521">We got beatings every day, coming in or going out. </sentence><sentence id="522">The food was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="523">We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night. </sentence><sentence id="524">But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in order to keep our things a little bit up. </sentence><sentence id="525">When we came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, it was altogether different. </sentence><sentence id="526">It was hard to believe what was going on over there. </sentence><sentence id="527">We could see the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span>. </sentence><sentence id="528">We could smell the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="529">We knew the people that were taken over there. </sentence><sentence id="530">We were ones of the lucky ones. </sentence><sentence id="531">The minute we got out of the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and they started chasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then they put us through a solution that we walked through. </sentence><sentence id="532">We didn't even know. </sentence><sentence id="533">We were just like animals. </sentence><sentence id="534">You were chased and you didn't know what was going on to you at that time. </sentence><sentence id="535">Then they put us in <span class="dlf">line</span> and they came out and the doctors mingle and the other ones were in white coats, and they look through and one of them goes to this side, and one of them goes to this <span class="region">side</span>, and one to this <span class="region">side</span>, and one to the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="536">Now, I was lucky that it was <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, not really <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="537">This was part -- they called it <span class="populated place">Auschwitz II</span>. </sentence><sentence id="538">Then them came to make the selections. </sentence><sentence id="539">When they made the selections and I was sent away in those first three days, that I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="540">I don't even remember. </sentence><sentence id="541">It's very hard for me to remember. </sentence><sentence id="542">We didn't do any work. </sentence><sentence id="543">We were sitting outside. </sentence><sentence id="544">It was cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into <span class="building">barracks</span> until they came at night. </sentence><sentence id="545">Then we used to sleep with 15 people on one , with a little bit of snow. </sentence><sentence id="546">I was glad to get out from there. </sentence><sentence id="547">When they brought us into , which was part of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, it was the <span class="building">factory</span> that we went to, over there, because we worked with different nationalities and we worked in the <span class="building">factory</span> with a lot of Germans, everybody had a different . </sentence><sentence id="548">We had a straw sack with a little blanket. </sentence><sentence id="549">That's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="550">We slept with about 200 people in one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="551">But they kept us a little bit cleaner. </sentence><sentence id="552">We had the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> and the clothes that we were wearing the striped clothes. </sentence><sentence id="553">We had to change because in the <span class="building">factory</span> it was grease working around <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">We had to change. </sentence><sentence id="555">We used to come <span class="building">home</span>, and used to change  0 the clothes and they gave us other clothes. </sentence><sentence id="556">But, we had selections every Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="557">They looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they send them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">They brought in other people to replace them. </sentence><sentence id="559">The food we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed outside. </sentence><sentence id="560">They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay outside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men were found. </sentence><sentence id="561">Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came out, or something happened, but we had to wait. </sentence><sentence id="562">And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to work until everything was counted. </sentence><sentence id="563">Then we had about five miles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">The music was playing near the <span class="dlf">gate</span> where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. </sentence><sentence id="566">The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you had to survive on something. </sentence><sentence id="567">We got a little bit, it was like tea. </sentence><sentence id="568">They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="569">Then in the middle of the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. </sentence><sentence id="570">Then at night, when we came <span class="building">home</span>, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="571">This was our food for a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="572">Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick. </sentence><sentence id="573">The minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and by the time we got back, we had <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> behind us that they killed off the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="574">We just loaded on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked from the <span class="building">factory</span> to the thing. </sentence><sentence id="575">The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed them on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and they put them on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and then they took them away to the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">But we couldn't help ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="577">We couldn't even escape because on the outside there was nobody to help us. </sentence><sentence id="578">I had a friend that escaped from the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> when they took us on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and got into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and when he came back, he was taken to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="579">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="580">I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="581">He came back, he said listen don't go on those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> because they burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="582">We didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="583">We said how can they tell living people and burn them especially you know in our days? </sentence><sentence id="584">And another thing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody outside must know because if they would know what was going on in here, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="585">But, we never got any help from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="586">When he was on the outside and was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, he said he couldn't stay over there because they wanted to kill him because , so he tried to get back and came back to our <span class="populated place">camp</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="587">This was in before they took us on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">That man didn't live through. </sentence><sentence id="589">They took us on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, because he was already on those <span class="spatial object">trains</span> going to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> one time, from , from our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">He jumped the <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and he was shot before he got -- no, before we got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, he ran away, and he was shot. </sentence><sentence id="591">But, when we came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we realized what the man told us was true, but we couldn't help ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="592"><span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we had a lot of hope. </sentence><sentence id="593">We could see that  1 this thing couldn't last on forever. </sentence><sentence id="594">But, it was very easy to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="595">All you had to do was through yourself on the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, because the <span class="dlf">wires</span> were electric. </sentence><sentence id="596">They had 600 volts in them. </sentence><sentence id="597">And a lot of people did it. </sentence><sentence id="598">But, if we found out that somebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the <span class="region">outside world</span> cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not do anything. </sentence><sentence id="599">It looks like the war is already coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="600">We knew little things what were going on because we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">radios</span>. </sentence><sentence id="601">We didn't have any papers, and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the <span class="building">factory</span> were afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him away. </sentence><sentence id="602">They took them away, too. </sentence><sentence id="603">So, we tried to help each other as much as we could in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="604">And thank God some of us survived. </sentence><sentence id="605">When they took us out on the Death March --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="727">One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they have to take us all out. </sentence><sentence id="728">They didn't take us where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="729">We found out later that this was the death march. </sentence><sentence id="730">We were only about 60 kilometers away from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and all the people that were going met the same way. </sentence><sentence id="731">So, they took us out one morning. </sentence><sentence id="732">It was snowing in January, January the 22nd. </sentence><sentence id="733">It was snowing and it was very cold outside because over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero. </sentence><sentence id="734">We didn't have any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="735">We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any <span class="spatial object">trains</span> to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the way. </sentence><sentence id="736">One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in , which was a big <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="737">They brought us in all over there because the SS that were going with us, they had to rest a little bit too. </sentence><sentence id="738">So, we stayed over and in the middle of the night they started shelling the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="739">They woke us up about 12:00, 1:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="740">There might have been about 60,000 of us over there because they brought them from all over. </sentence><sentence id="741">They chased us out and I had a dream that night when I was sleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this place and I had an argument with her. </sentence><sentence id="742">I told her listen, how can I not leave. </sentence><sentence id="743">You know we're almost liberated. </sentence><sentence id="744">You see what's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the dream. </sentence><sentence id="745">When I was near the <span class="dlf">gate</span> to go out, I had two friends with me, one was from my <span class="populated place">town</span>, Weinberg was his name, and the other one was from . </sentence><sentence id="746">When we came to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, my dream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="747">I'm not going. </sentence><sentence id="748">So, the other one from my <span class="populated place">town</span>, he didn't want to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="749">He said, Sam we're almost liberated I'm going out. </sentence><sentence id="750">I'm going where they chasing us to go. </sentence><sentence id="751">I said no, but the other one, I took care of him. </sentence><sentence id="752">He was a little bit younger and I took care of him a lot in <span class="populated place">camp</span> when I was there. </sentence><sentence id="753">So, I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the other side and there was a big <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="754">It was a <span class="dlf">brick wall</span> over there about three foot thick, and there was a big <span class="dlf">hole</span> in it that was made from one of the <span class="env feature">shells</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="755">I crawled out and there was a <span class="env feature">ravine</span> and I rolled down into the snow with them and we ran into the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and we stayed over there for about eight days until the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="756">The Russians liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="757">If you asked me how I survived in those  2 <span class="env feature">woods</span> for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember. </sentence><sentence id="758">I know we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="759">In <span class="country">Europe</span> they used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time outside and they used to cover them with sawdust and then have a <span class="dlf">door</span> on the <span

a couple, an elder couple that passed away on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> because they ate too much of the food that they shouldn't have eaten. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Even I

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1420">Q: You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at this tape and say monstrosities, maybe they're going to want to know more what that means? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They are some good people with the bad ones too. </sentence><sentence id="1424">Even there were in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and I worked with a German that was running the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1425">It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it until I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a certain place and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come <span class="building">home</span>, you know, back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, I used to share it with my friends. </sentence><sentence id="1426">The fellow when were in the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="building">barrack</span> was a German by the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in <span class="building">jail</span> and then they put him in charge of us. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I also found out later that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in <span class="populated place">camp</span> in those days, but he also had a girlfriend in the <span class="building">factory</span> and he spoke German and she spoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the <span class="building">factory</span> back to <span class="populated place">camp</span> from him to her because he couldn't go out from <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1428">We went to <span class="building">work</span>, but he stayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came <span class="building">home</span> at night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost difference between life and death, this soup. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And also, in the winter time it was very cold over there, but because we worked in the <span class="building">train factory</span> an the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when we came back to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, we had a little <span class="spatial object">bellie stove</span>, a little <span class="spatial object">iron stove</span> and the fellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the <span class="populated place">camp</span> didn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little <span class="spatial object">stove</span> and we had it a little bit warmer at night. </sentence><sentence id="1430">We were one of the lucky ones maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1431">You had to help yourself a little. </sentence><sentence id="1432">You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you went through the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1433">I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of being in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, because in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> you couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1434">The people that maybe  2 survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1435">If you were picked to do a job you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="1436">You took the people from the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and put them in the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> and it was people like us. </sentence><sentence id="1437">You know, they picked them out and that's what you did. </sentence><sentence id="1438">So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they put you in the <span class="building">crematorium</span> and picked somebody else to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1439">So, it wasn't something like just -- in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I was in they used to hang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They used to pick up people from the <span class="spatial object">rolls</span> after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and we used to hang them. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They didn't do it themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Used to go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I would have to do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1444">It was one of those things. </sentence><sentence id="1445">Another thing in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> Sunday when we didn't go to <span class="building">work</span> even if it was cold, we had to stay outside the hole day. </sentence><sentence id="1446">They wouldn't let us go into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and sit inside because we were going to make it dirty. </sentence><sentence id="1447">The <span class="interior space">floors</span> are going to be dirty. </sentence><sentence id="1448">We had to make our <span class="spatial object">bed</span> as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the <span class="building">infirmary</span> because you knew what was going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="1449">I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I used to go to <span class="building">work</span>, and I used to be sick. </sentence><sentence id="1450">I used to get a sore throat and a fever. </sentence><sentence id="1451">I used to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I never stayed in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I figured if I stay I know what's going to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went <span class="building">home</span>, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends were dragging me in until we got in there. </sentence><sentence id="1454">I used to take my friends until we got back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and that's how I survived. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="1456">If not we wouldn't be here. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> it was so bad, but we survived somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1458">It's amazing what a human being can stand when it happens. </sentence><sentence id="1459">There was no place for us to escape because there was no body that helped a Jew on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Maybe in another <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Maybe in <span class="country">Holland</span> or <span class="country">Belgium</span> or <span class="country">France</span> but not in <span class="country">Poland</span> because most of the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> were built in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Even from the <span class="country">countries</span>, they brought them into <span class="country">Poland</span>, like <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, <span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1463"><span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>, is a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that still the Germans didn't have time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. </sentence><sentence id="1464">The <span class="building">crematoriums</span> and everything is over there. </sentence><sentence id="1465">That's why I took the march of the living kids who went to <span class="populated place">Maidonek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1466">It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1467">A lot of the Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1468">When I was in there was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> of Russian prisoners that they brought in. </sentence><sentence id="1469">There was an <span class="populated place">American prison camp</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="1470">They put them on the outside with a <span class="dlf">fence</span> around it, didn't feed them.
