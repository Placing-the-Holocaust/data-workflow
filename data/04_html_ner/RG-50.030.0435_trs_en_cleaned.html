<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: What year? </sentence><sentence id="186">I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't remember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better. </sentence><sentence id="187">Though the government officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of things I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from history. </sentence><sentence id="188">That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the . </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="214">Because I wasn't brought up in the <span class="env feature">environment</span> and my grandmother was so orthodox, so it was more modest and you didn't know much about sex, you know? </sentence><sentence id="215">And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time. </sentence><sentence id="216">And I remember that in our <span class="populated place">city</span> there was a girl, her name was Rosa Loberta (ph) and she was a leader from . </sentence><sentence id="217">And because some of my friends who were somewhat older along there, to tell you the truth, I knew it's a Zionistic organization. </sentence><sentence id="218">I didn't understand yet exactly the, I didn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you. </sentence><sentence id="219">So I wanted to belong too. </sentence><sentence id="220">And in <span class="country">Poland</span> everybody belongs to orthodox, to some different organizations, but practically everybody belonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to . </sentence><sentence id="221">And I remember she took me to one meeting and Rosa Loberta (ph) was there and I met her and I said to her, "Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting." </sentence><sentence id="222">And this was about a year before the Nazis came in. </sentence><sentence id="223">And she said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), you have to wait because it starts from  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection used to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that <span class="spatial object">chest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I used to think, maybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers. </sentence><sentence id="225">It was a whole source of curiosity for me. </sentence><sentence id="226">And I remember one day my mother said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), please come. </sentence><sentence id="227">Come here. </sentence><sentence id="228">I want to show you something." </sentence><sentence id="229">She took out the key and she opened the <span class="spatial object">chest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">And I had like two kinds of emotions. </sentence><sentence id="231">In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the <span class="spatial object">chest</span> that was constantly closed. </sentence><sentence id="232">And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?What is there? </sentence><sentence id="233">And she opened the <span class="spatial object">chest</span> and she said, "Look <span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="234">And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books. </sentence><sentence id="235">And she took out a book, pointed to the <span class="interior space">closet</span>, she said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. </sentence><sentence id="236">You can sit right here in <span class="building">Chair-hon-off</span> (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world." </sentence><sentence id="237">And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read. </sentence><sentence id="238">And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. </sentence><sentence id="239">And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. </sentence><sentence id="240">And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 other world where they were so cruel to him here? </sentence><sentence id="241">And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. </sentence><sentence id="242">Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. </sentence><sentence id="243">So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?" </sentence><sentence id="244">And he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="245">And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter." </sentence><sentence id="246">And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent. </sentence><sentence id="247">He had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="248">And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="249">So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that <span class="populated place">Paris</span> (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. </sentence><sentence id="250">This book is in English still and its beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="251">I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty. </sentence><sentence id="252">And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? </sentence><sentence id="253">He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out. </sentence><sentence id="254">But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="255">When <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>, the first thing of the <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other <span class="building">house</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="256">And our <span class="building">house</span> was strict , which was near <span class="dlf">Warsaw Street</span>, which was the main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">And as soon as we  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 intelligencia (ph). </sentence><sentence id="258">Some Polish people too. </sentence><sentence id="259">And they took them away some, they shot, the ones they took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="260">And they started to destroy the <span class="building">Synagogues</span>, the Holy Scriptures. </sentence><sentence id="261">They confiscated all our <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">We didn't have, in <span class="populated place">Check-hon-off</span> (ph) a <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">My father was, like I said, I told you before. </sentence><sentence id="264">And they started to put on curfews. </sentence><sentence id="265">We were not allowed to congregate in large groups. </sentence><sentence id="266">I could no longer, we could no longer go to <span class="building">school</span>, all <span class="building">schools</span> were closed. </sentence><sentence id="267">All <span class="building">social Temples</span> were closed. </sentence><sentence id="268">We had to wear a yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="269">We were not allowed to walk on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span>, just in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened. </sentence><sentence id="271">Everyday they made new laws. </sentence><sentence id="272">And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws because they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: How soon did this happen after they came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books. </sentence><sentence id="343">I told you, my mother valued so much book and its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was from the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the <span class="building">Synagogue</span>, in the <span class="building">Synagogue</span>, they burned down everything. </sentence><sentence id="344">So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not allowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ; which is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers. </sentence><sentence id="345">So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most. </sentence><sentence id="346">They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. </sentence><sentence id="347">So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. </sentence><sentence id="348">They started to torture, to mock. </sentence><sentence id="349">Because to, they did whatever they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="350">They had all legal rights to do those things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="351">And then they confiscated the <span class="building">business</span>, they looted the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="352">They started to ration the food and started starvation. </sentence><sentence id="353">And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="354">And after a whole day's work, they would come <span class="building">home</span> and would have to stay in long <span class="dlf">lines</span> to get a small ration, a very small ration. </sentence><sentence id="355">So right away we started to starve. </sentence><sentence id="356">Couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">And in other <span class="country">country</span> the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. </sentence><sentence id="358">But you couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="359">So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="360">That we had to be silent, you know, in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="361">And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="362">They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="363">So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="364"> because they singled us out as an inferior race. </sentence><sentence id="365">And we were not allowed to have  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="366"> 2 bought maybe 90 percent of the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="367">My mother didn't buy anything. </sentence><sentence id="368">We gave up the merchandise, you know? </sentence><sentence id="369">Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="370">But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who was selling the merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="371">But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our <span class="building">house</span> and denounced my mother. </sentence><sentence id="372">And they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us." </sentence><sentence id="373">And that is the first time in my life that I heard my mother lie. </sentence><sentence id="374">She said she didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="375">But she did know who he was. </sentence><sentence id="376">He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to <span class="building">school</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="377">So after... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="378"> End of Tape 1. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="379"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="380">It is not the primary

Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our <span class="building">house</span> and they interrogated my mother. </sentence><sentence id="383">They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was. </sentence><sentence id="384">And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying. </sentence><sentence id="385">That she said she didn't know, she denied it. </sentence><sentence id="386">So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. </sentence><sentence id="387">They took her away. </sentence><sentence id="388">The Gestapo took her away. </sentence><sentence id="389">I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. </sentence><sentence id="390">So I was afraid to be separated from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="391">So I run after her. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone. </sentence><sentence id="393">So they kept on chasing me away. </sentence><sentence id="394">And finally, one of them said, "Take her too."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3324">A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. </sentence><sentence id="3325">However, I don't do only the things which are easy. </sentence><sentence id="3326">I do many things which are difficult but they are necessary. </sentence><sentence id="3327">And when I was asked, there was here a professor , the late , | mentioned to you before. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And she is from  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 a little feelings. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And I realized that there is not, we realized that there is very little in the text books about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3337">Q: Actually what I'm trying to understand is, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but you had friends from all walks of life, talking in the earlier days here. </sentence><sentence id="3338">Was this something that you could talk about? </sentence><sentence id="3339">That you could share? </sentence><sentence id="3340">Did people want to hear about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3347">Q: Just on a personal basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3349">A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions. </sentence><sentence id="3350">And I answered. </sentence><sentence id="3351">I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they asked about sex. </sentence><sentence id="3352">Short question, short answer. </sentence><sentence

later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3356">They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3357">So we started to form an organization and be involved with this here. </sentence><sentence id="3358">So it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="3359">Because, to give you one example, with some people it was easier. </sentence><sentence id="3360">Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding and more curious. </sentence><sentence id="3361">Others are more involved with their own life. </sentence><sentence id="3362">So it depends who it was. </sentence><sentence id="3363">I had my late friend
