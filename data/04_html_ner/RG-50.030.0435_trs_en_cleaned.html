<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begin by having you tell me your name, date of birth and where you were born, and a little bit about your family. </sentence><sentence id="36">And you might tell me your name now and your name at birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. </sentence><sentence id="40">I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph). </sentence><sentence id="42">My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) <span class="building">In-de-yum-fa-yetska</span> (ph), a name which I like to be called. </sentence><sentence id="43">I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating . </sentence><sentence id="44">I was the oldest of three siblings. </sentence><sentence id="45">I was born in a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Chair-han-off</span> (ph) <span class="country">Poland</span>, located about 90 kilometers north of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, <span class="populated place">Chair-han-off</span> (ph) <span class="country">Poland</span> was about 15,000. </sentence><sentence id="47">A little less than half of that was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="48">My family consisted at that time of my parents, Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, . </sentence><sentence id="49">My ancestors on my mother's side came to <span class="country">Poland</span> from <span class="country">Germany</span> around the 16" century. </sentence><sentence id="50">Four generations were still alive and each one had a lot of children because they came from an orthodox background. </sentence><sentence id="51">So my grandmother was one of seven siblings. </sentence><sentence id="52">My mother was one of seven siblings. </sentence><sentence id="53">My Aunt who lived also in <span class="building">Chair-han-off</span> (ph) had also seven children. </sentence><sentence id="54">My other Uncle had three children. </sentence><sentence id="55">They all had, the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children. </sentence><sentence id="56">So we had a very large family. </sentence><sentence id="57">I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and my first role models. </sentence><sentence id="58">I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an extremely religious woman, observant woman, at <span class="building">home</span> we only spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="59">We observed the Jewish laws, customs and traditions. </sentence><sentence id="60">And my grandmother was wearing a <span class="spatial object">shaytle</span> (ph), in Yiddish its called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes. </sentence><sentence id="61">For my grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she behaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us. </sentence><sentence id="62">And I remember that every morning when I would get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with me the prayers. </sentence><sentence id="63">She used to give me coins to put in the <span class="spatial object">push-ka</span> (ph), which is called her <span class="spatial object">charity box</span>, and she would tell me, "Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah (ph), our commandment." </sentence><sentence id="64">I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one coin from another, and a poor man came to our <span class="dlf">door</span> and asked my grandmother for alms. </sentence><sentence id="65">And my grandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my hand and I said, "Grandma, so much money?" </sentence><sentence id="66">And my grandmother said, "My child, you only have what you give away." </sentence><sentence id="67">I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it, being so little, how can you give away something and still have it? </sentence><sentence id="68">So my grandma began with a smile and says, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me. </sentence><sentence id="69">I'm not giving mine." </sentence><sentence id="70">This is how she felt. </sentence><sentence id="71">And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories. </sentence><sentence id="72">I came from a family of story-tellers. </sentence><sentence id="73">And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much so, and my grandmother had lots of children. </sentence><sentence id="74">In fact, when <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>, my grandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild. </sentence><sentence id="75">Only one granddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph). </sentence><sentence id="76">I was eight years old when she emigrated to <span class="country">Palestine</span> in 1934, to get married with somebody who was, without her boyfriend, that she met also in <span class="country">Poland</span>, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same <span class="populated place">city</span>, the same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I remember that the whole family was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, "God knows if we will see each other This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="78">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="79"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection again." </sentence><sentence id="80">And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry. </sentence><sentence id="81">With God all things are possible." </sentence><sentence id="82">I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. </sentence><sentence id="83">She lost a brother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter. </sentence><sentence id="84">But she never lost her unshakable faith in God. </sentence><sentence id="85">And she always believed and she never questioned. </sentence><sentence id="86">And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me. </sentence><sentence id="87">And she lived with us from the day I was born. </sentence><sentence id="88">And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly after <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of , which in English means humanness. </sentence><sentence id="90">Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of , they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they would say, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), its not -" Luse to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that <span class="spatial object">yardstick</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me. </sentence><sentence id="92">And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. </sentence><sentence id="93">But they were strict with me. </sentence><sentence id="94">When I was already a <span class="building">school</span> girl, I remember in <span class="country">Poland</span> was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like you know and the kids didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="95">So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too. </sentence><sentence id="96">So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks? </sentence><sentence id="97">And they said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), its too cold". </sentence><sentence id="98">And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do? </sentence><sentence id="99">I went in and I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">My father often used to come to the <span class="dlf">school yard</span> because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the <span class="building">dairy business</span>, like <span class="building">wholesale dairy business</span>, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether they, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing. </sentence><sentence id="101">So he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come <span class="building">home</span>, or before he left, if I wasn't <span class="building">home</span>, the <span class="building">school</span> wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something, just to see me. </sentence><sentence id="102">So that particular morning, I went to <span class="building">school</span> and it was recess and some of the kids started to say, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), your father is here." </sentence><sentence id="103">And I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="104">I was wearing the knee socks. </sentence><sentence id="105">And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), I feel very and disappointed in you. </sentence><sentence id="106">Because everybody can make a mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not and I'm very disappointed." </sentence><sentence id="107">And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me up and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, "Yit-cola (ph), everybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same. </sentence><sentence id="108">And in everything there is a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="109">So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping other people." </sentence><sentence id="110">The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came in, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you know how justice is important. </sentence><sentence id="111">I remember one time I was walking <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span> alone and a bunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and physically. </sentence><sentence id="112">I tried to free myself but the <span class="dlf">circle</span> closed around me and I felt punches coming all over. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter with an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I couldn't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="115">Why are they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="116">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="117"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection so angry with me? </sentence><sentence id="118">Why do they hate me so much? </sentence><sentence id="119">I was too young to understand it and I came <span class="building">home</span> crying bitterly. </sentence><sentence id="120">Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">And she asked me, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), what's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="122">You'll see later why those things are important, because of the values. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: So your mother asked you what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: What happened. </sentence><sentence id="215">I related to her the whole story. </sentence><sentence id="216">And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me. </sentence><sentence id="217">After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?" </sentence><sentence id="218">And I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="219">I said, "Nothing." </sentence><sentence id="220">And my mother looked , She said, "Well my child, then you have nothing to cry about. </sentence><sentence id="221">Your does not depend on how others treat you but on how you treat others." </sentence><sentence id="222">And I remember my family taught me that my does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date. </sentence><sentence id="223">Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame or held others because its not . </sentence><sentence id="224">But they never taught me, what should I do when I am held, how should I respond? </sentence><sentence id="225">So what I used to do, I use to cry. </sentence><sentence id="226">Because I knew I cannot held anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my spirit as long as I don't do something evil. </sentence><sentence id="227">As long as I don't do something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="228">So they actually very much stressed , Yiddish 3 . </sentence><sentence id="229">Lreceived both, like I said at <span class="building">home</span> we spoke Yiddish but in <span class="building">school</span> we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to <span class="populated place">Bant-tee-os-kov</span> (ph), which was a Jewish and <span class="building">Hebrew school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">My little brother actually started at age three. </sentence><sentence id="231">My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="232">But in those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we had in our <span class="building">home</span>, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and traditions. </sentence><sentence id="233">Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a shaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person. </sentence><sentence id="234">She had a beautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs. </sentence><sentence id="235">Because before my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the <span class="building">Yiddish Theater</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">And at that time, the <span class="building">Yiddish Theater</span> used to be the , like a regular <span class="building">theater</span> but they had that in the <span class="building">fire house</span>, you know? </sentence><sentence id="237">Where the firemen lived, so they would allow them there. </sentence><sentence id="238">But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for charity. </sentence><sentence id="239">So my parents very often used to take me to the <span class="building">theater</span> and my mother belonged to a literary group. </sentence><sentence id="240">She was more, she was very artistic. </sentence><sentence id="241">If she would have had the opportunity then she would have done much more, but unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I think that she instilled in me a love for literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of grandchildren and children. </sentence><sentence id="243">Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in 1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I never knew him. </sentence><sentence id="244">I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from <span class="country">England</span>, <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">Because that's where he married and he lived. </sentence><sentence id="246">So the whole family lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> and we used to be a very close-knit family. </sentence><sentence id="247">So we got together and because there was not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used to, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know? </sentence><sentence id="248">And everybody thought that I don't even pay attention and I was just sitting in a <span class="interior space">corner</span> and listen and take in all these stories. </sentence><sentence id="249">Another time also that I heard a lot of stories is that in <span class="country">Poland</span>, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was only one <span class="building">Synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">But there was the , like they call it, like the <span class="building">study house</span> and a lot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other <span class="populated place">cities</span> so they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring <span class="building">home</span>, in the Hebrew its This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="251">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="252"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection called , or guests. </sentence><sentence id="253">And then there would be conversation at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and they used to ask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories. </sentence><sentence id="254">So it was, and one thing also, that after my mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my <span class="building">grandmother home</span>, which was a great influence. </sentence><sentence id="255">I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me, is that we didn't have running water or electricity in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">And winter, to heat the <span class="building">house</span>, we cooked on an <span class="spatial object">iron stove</span>, and to heat the <span class="building">house</span> it used to be a <span class="spatial object">tile oven</span>, which reached from the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, most people in <span class="country">Poland</span> had those, and they used to, they were able to open <span class="dlf">wells</span>, you put the wood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this would be the source of heat, that heated the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">So when they came on the holidays and , they would sit around the <span class="spatial object">oven</span> and tell these stories. </sentence><sentence id="258">And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="259">And I was always, when I started to go to <span class="building">school</span>, one of my worst subjects was history. </sentence><sentence id="260">Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates, long ago, and a lot of places. </sentence><sentence id="261">But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea before the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects people. </sentence><sentence id="262">And I was a creative child. </sentence><sentence id="263">I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing this. </sentence><sentence id="264">And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished <span class="building">public school</span>, that I going to continue to have more formal education, that I'm going to become a writer. </sentence><sentence id="265">Even as a young girl I used to write a lot. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father used to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, "Yit-cola (ph), recite a poem." </sentence><sentence id="267">And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems and I learned lots of songs, both at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny, that there used to people who would go in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> and sing and play instruments and some had wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money. </sentence><sentence id="269">So I remember once I was going <span class="building">home</span>, it was on a Friday, I was going <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And those people played in our <span class="interior space">yard</span> and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song. </sentence><sentence id="271">I caught most of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in the same <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> so I followed them. </sentence><sentence id="272">And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its Friday and the family is going to be ready, the <span class="spatial object">sha-bot</span> (ph) was observed very strictly. </sentence><sentence id="273">And I remember I came <span class="building">home</span>, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot (ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, "Yit- cola (ph), quickly. </sentence><sentence id="274">Go in and wash up. </sentence><sentence id="275">Come to <span class="building">sha-bot</span> (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="276">And I was so grateful that she didn't scream at me or anything. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned before, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every year, we observed Passover. </sentence><sentence id="278">And it was so different than it is now because every single object of the <span class="building">house</span> was taken out in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279"><span class="spatial object">Dishes</span> were changed. </sentence><sentence id="280">And at that time, I remember, we didn't have regular <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put in the, they changed the straw. </sentence><sentence id="281">And paint the <span class="building">house</span> and wash every <span class="spatial object">object</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was more for cleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual cleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it is very, it is coincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the , and we're talking about slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't understand this here. </sentence><sentence id="284">Because up until then, I was never starved. </sentence><sentence id="285">I never had any personal tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="286">My faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a , and I couldn't understand all those things. </sentence><sentence id="287">And I remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we suffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="288">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="289"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact

then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here. </sentence><sentence id="291">So, in my, it never entered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here. </sentence><sentence id="292">That my people will suffer like this here. </sentence><sentence id="293">And I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: Yeah, that was not because we were of poverty. </sentence><sentence id="385">This was because in the small 5 nobody in the small had it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="386">So, in fact, when I went now back to <span class="country">Poland</span>, they still have, some people have <span class="building">outhouses</span> and things, you know? </sentence><sentence id="387">But its so much more moder, its more in the larger <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">But at that time it was common, you didn't know anything different because I remember, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">When my family took me I came <span class="building">home</span> and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> and you pulled the string from the <span class="interior space">ceiling</span> and I said, "It was like a miracle to me." </sentence><sentence id="390">So it was because this was, I'm describing the world the way I knew it and this all influenced, you know? </sentence><sentence id="391">Because when there was not water in the <span class="building">house</span>, so we had a <span class="spatial object">water carrier</span> who would bring in water. </sentence><sentence id="392">We didn't have like today ready-made foods and, or you could go into the <span class="building">kosher butcher</span> like today and buy a chicken. </sentence><sentence id="393">At that time we used to go to the <span class="building">market</span> which was the <span class="building">market place</span> was the place where Jews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring livestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they would bring vegetable and fruits. </sentence><sentence id="394">The Jewish people would bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes. </sentence><sentence id="395">So that was the exchange because that was the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="396">And so those things were, the life was different and it influenced differently also. </sentence><sentence id="397">But going back now to the not having electricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, from a nuft (ph) its called in Polish, petroleum, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Kerosene, yes, I forgot the word, kerosene. </sentence><sentence id="415">So we had a <span class="spatial object">kerosene lamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">And still we would always sit and read and it was very, education was extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="417">And so I remember that we didn't have a <span class="spatial object">refrigerator</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">We didn't have all the modern appliances because at that time nobody had them in our .[end of side 1 of tape 1] So of course we didn't have any, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">refrigerator</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">And we used to store food in the <span class="interior space">root cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="420">We called it root because, besides holding the perishable food we would put in there for the winter, sometimes my father would go to the <span class="country">country</span> and buy like a whole sack of potatoes, carrots, onions, for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="421">And we also would keep there in the winter the perishable food, you know, when we cooked something. </sentence><sentence id="422">Sometimes when it was very cold, I remember my mother used to put it on the <span class="dlf">window sill</span>, outside on the <span class="dlf">window sill</span>, but mostly in the <span class="interior space">root cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">So one time, in the <span class="interior

ring, you pulled up the ring and there was a long <span class="dlf">ladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425">It wasn't built in, it was put in, and you had to walk this, this <span

</sentence><sentence id="428">Cold. </sentence><sentence id="429">It smelled wonderful with all the different kinds of vegetable things. </sentence><sentence id="430">But it was dark and I was, as I mentioned before, I was only 13 when the war broke out and this was earlier, so I was afraid to go down. </sentence><sentence id="431">And my mother noticed that I am afraid. </sentence><sentence id="432">She said, "Lit a candle." </sentence><sentence id="433">She gave me the candle to my hand, and she tell me, she waved to me, for me, and she said, "Go <span class="populated

the family. </sentence><sentence id="441">So I walked down and I brought up the butter. </sentence><sentence id="442">And afterwards I wasn't so afraid anymore of the dark <span class="interior

</sentence><sentence id="446">And so at <span class="building">home</span> it was warm, it was a wonderful world. </sentence><sentence id="447">My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of food without saying , which means a special prayer. </sentence><sentence id="448">And always stressed the importance. </sentence><sentence id="449">Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was . </sentence><sentence id="450">And another thing which I do really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added. </sentence><sentence id="451">She never took me for granted. </sentence><sentence id="452">She would many times over say, "Oh my , God Bless you and thank you", and she would make me feel so good. </sentence><sentence

"It's just a little thing". </sentence><sentence id="456">And my grandmother would smile and she would say, she always, when I asked her something she had such a beautiful, warm smile, she said, "Yes my child. </sentence><sentence id="457">But kindness and caring are not little things." </sentence><sentence id="458">And the reason why the is later I found out how much those values helped to shape me. </sentence><sentence id="459">And also of course there was the influence from friends. </sentence><sentence id="460">In fact, I used to have one friend because where we lived, we lived at two

id="643">You know, the older children, because I was and I think because of my grandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all other influence from my parents who took me to the <span class="building">theaters</span>, who took me to Jewish plays and every summer we would go to the <span class="country">country</span> and , cousins, from <span

the papers. </sentence><sentence id="654">It was a whole source of curiosity for me. </sentence><sentence id="655">And I remember one day my mother said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), please come. </sentence><sentence id="656">Come here. </sentence><sentence id="657">I want to show you something." </sentence><sentence id="658">She took out the key and she opened the <span

<span class="spatial object">chest</span> that was constantly closed. </sentence><sentence id="661">And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?What is there? </sentence><sentence id="662">And she opened the <span class="spatial object">chest</span> and she said, "Look <span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="663">And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books. </sentence><sentence id="664">And she took out a book, pointed to the <span class="interior space">closet</span>, she said, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. </sentence><sentence id="665">You can sit right here in <span class="building">Chair-hon-off</span> (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world." </sentence><sentence id="666">And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read. </sentence><sentence id="667">And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. </sentence><sentence id="668">And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff. </sentence><sentence id="669">And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called , Bunchos (ph) of the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="670">I remember many stories, but this story I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="671">And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos (ph), which means silent. </sentence><sentence id="672">And this man, when he was a little child, lost his mother and became an orphan, only had his father. </sentence><sentence id="673">At the age of 13, the father remarried and took a very cruel woman who abused the little boy. </sentence><sentence id="674">She would eat well but she would starve him. </sentence><sentence id="675">She made him chop wood barefoot in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="676">He never had a new change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="677">They didn't send him to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">Didn't have a friend. </sentence><sentence id="679">But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely, but he never complained, not even to his father. </sentence><sentence id="680">And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a drunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair. </sentence><sentence id="681">He picked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="682">He wandered into a big <span class="populated place">city</span> and for no reason known to him he was put in <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">And then he was, for the same unknown reason to him, he was let go. </sentence><sentence id="684">But he was still silent. </sentence><sentence id="685">Never complained. </sentence><sentence id="686">Then the story relates how he suffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then people wouldn't pay him. </sentence><sentence id="687">He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent. </sentence><sentence id="688">And then he married a woman who already had a child. </sentence><sentence id="689">And it was a little boy, a baby. </sentence><sentence id="690">And she left him with the child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="691">But <span class="populated place">Buncho</span> (ph) was again silent. </sentence><sentence id="692">And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story. </sentence><sentence id="693">It kept me so in suspense. </sentence><sentence id="694">I remember it today. </sentence><sentence id="695">Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read well, I read many of the books which my mother had in that <span class="spatial object">chest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">And the reason why she kept it locked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her books. </sentence><sentence id="697">Later, when we were older, the <span class="spatial object">chest</span> was open when we learned to respect it. </sentence><sentence id="698">But its just the values that she had. </sentence><sentence id="699">So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">And even in the <span class="building">hospital</span> where people are allowed to complain, he was still silent. </sentence><sentence id="701">And in silence he lived and in silence he died. </sentence><sentence id="702">And after he was buried they put a piece of wood and a marker on his <span class="dlf">grave</span> and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife found it and used it to light the, to heat the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="703">So he didn't even have a <span class="dlf">grave</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="704">And then, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice. </sentence><sentence id="705">And when he came up, they told him, "Buncho (ph), here in <span class="dlf">heaven</span> everything is yours. </sentence><sentence id="706">Whatever you want. </sentence><sentence id="707">Pick, choose." </sentence><sentence id="708">And he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="709">Why would somebody be so good to him in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="710">It is not the primary source, and it has not been

cruel to him here? </sentence><sentence id="712">And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. </sentence><sentence id="713">Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more. </sentence><sentence id="714">So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?" </sentence><sentence id="715">And he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="716">And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter." </sentence><sentence id="717">And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent. </sentence><sentence id="718">He had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="719">And also, what would we give for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="720">So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that <span class="populated place">Paris</span> (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic. </sentence><sentence id="721">This book is in English still and its beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="722">I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty. </sentence><sentence id="723">And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? </sentence><sentence id="724">He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out. </sentence><sentence id="725">But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent. </sentence><sentence id="726">When <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>, the first thing of the <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other <span class="building">house</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="727">And our <span class="building">house</span> was strict , which was near <span class="dlf">Warsaw Street</span>, which was the main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="728">And as soon as we came out, this was almost in the corner, was a large <span class="building">house</span> and they had a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, they had like big <span class="interior space">cellars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="729">So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="730">And even there, sitting there, my mother tried to calm us down with telling us stories. </sentence><sentence id="731">She was such a wonderful story-teller and she knew so much literature and so many plays. </sentence><sentence id="732">And then, when they just came in, we were still allowed to move from place to place, so people started to run. </sentence><sentence id="733">People from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> came to small <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence

when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our <span class="building">house</span> and they interrogated my mother. </sentence><sentence id="997">They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was. </sentence><sentence id="998">And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying. </sentence><sentence id="999">That she said she didn't know, she denied it. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They took her away. </sentence><sentence id="1002">The Gestapo took her away. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. </sentence><sentence id="1004">So I was afraid to be separated from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1005">So I run after her. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So they kept on chasing me away. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And finally, one of them said, "Take her too." </sentence><sentence id="1009">And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And they brought us to the Gestapo, the <span class="building">station</span>, and they separated us. </sentence><sentence id="1011">They took my mother in to a separate <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1012">This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1014">The shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent. </sentence><sentence id="1015">That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1016">But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the <span class="dlf">doors</span> swung open. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, dragging her across the <span

wanted to see whether she is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And I loved my mother because she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was.

</sentence><sentence id="1027">And they started to beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And after I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at <span class="building">home</span>, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin-nook (ph)". </sentence><sentence id="1029">Enough. , </sentence><sentence id="1030">which means maybe we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Maybe we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And that's when they released us. </sentence><sentence id="1033">This story begun in 1939, shortly after <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I didn't see anymore <span class="populated place">Cal-fus</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1035">I didn't know what's happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="1036">At that time, the Nazis used all kinds of techniques. </sentence><sentence id="1037">They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws. </sentence><sentence id="1038">We, in Judaism, in <span class="building">home</span> and in <span class="building">Hebrew school</span>, they taught us that we are all responsible for one another. </sentence><sentence id="1039">What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Group punishment for individual action. </sentence><sentence id="1041">So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force and we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So I didn't know what's happened to the Cal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they would have killed the whole family, not just the father. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And I'm going to stop here because I don't want to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And I'm going to skip and come back later to 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1045">I'm going now to 1981 when

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2384">Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was like for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2386">A: We didn't wake up by the <span class="spatial object">clock</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2387">We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="2388">We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day. </sentence><sentence id="2389">We didn't have any extra clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2390">This was all that we had. </sentence><sentence id="2391">And there was water but we were told that this is not good drinking water. </sentence><sentence id="2392">So <span class="env feature">water</span> was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="2393">We didn't have, we couldn't go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> when we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2394">It was like a <span class="interior space">collective bathroom</span>, like the <span class="spatial object">latrines</span> you know? </sentence><sentence id="2395">And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. </sentence><sentence id="2396">So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink. </sentence><sentence id="2397">And therefore they got diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="2398">And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up. </sentence><sentence id="2399">We didn't have anywhere to wash. </sentence><sentence id="2400">So it wasn't clean. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now. </sentence><sentence id="2403">So it was important. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2405">So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And we would start, go to the where we are counted. </sentence><sentence id="2407">Alive or dead, we had to be . </sentence><sentence id="2408">And they used the matter that one was responsible for all. </sentence><sentence id="2409">So if one person would not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no matter how long. </sentence><sentence id="2410">Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything. </sentence><sentence id="2411">If we didn't have, and we would stay, freeze. </sentence><sentence id="2412">So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you know somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each other. </sentence><sentence id="2413">And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And sometimes we would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="2415">Other times we would stay for hours. </sentence><sentence id="2416">And then they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would have had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water. </sentence><sentence id="2417">A little <span class="env feature">beet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2418">A piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2419">Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly. </sentence><sentence id="2420">But we didn't get enough of it. </sentence><sentence id="2421">We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat anything almost. </sentence><sentence id="2422">In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm us. </sentence><sentence id="2423">And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the snow. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that. </sentence><sentence id="2425">They tried to torture us. </sentence><sentence id="2426">And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear, "Links." </sentence><sentence id="2427">Line up and go march. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And on both sides big, long <span class="dlf">lines</span> with the prisoners marching, with the inmates marching. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about slavery in <span class="country">Egypt</span> or was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves. </sentence><sentence id="2430">So prisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not condemned to die, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2431">Not that way, they used them for something. </sentence><sentence id="2432">And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work. </sentence><sentence id="2433">And then we had to go through the <span class="dlf">gates</span>, and at the <span class="dlf">gates</span> many times was a <span class="dlf">dren-dall</span> (ph), they would take out somebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good. </sentence><sentence id="2434">Other times we were just called, 1-2-3, 5-6-7, the 8" out, sometimes the 10" out, we never know. </sentence><sentence id="2435">So you could not plan from one second to the other because you don't know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day. </sentence><sentence id="2436">That's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2437">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2438"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 must feel. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the <span class="dlf">outside line</span> so we tried to be in the <span class="dlf">inside line</span> and not to be the very first or the very last. </sentence><sentence id="2440">The less visible you could make yourself. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And we marched. </sentence><sentence id="2442">When I came I was assigned to <span class="dlf">Block 8</span> and a Turkish woman was our <span class="dlf">Block Elster</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2443">A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsible. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And then we came to work. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And we always worked outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2447">And, <span class="building">outer-commando</span> (ph) it was called, when you worked outside, <span class="building">outer-commando</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2448">And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was not usual work. </sentence><sentence id="2449">We would take stones or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used to mock us. </sentence><sentence id="2450">And point to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> and they said, "See? </sentence><sentence id="2451">That's where you're all going to come out." </sentence><sentence id="2452">And then he said, "Where is your God now?" </sentence><sentence id="2453">And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the <span class="interior space">root cellar</span>.

[ </sentence><sentence id="2463">humanness] is not here." </sentence><sentence id="2464">And I started to understand what means, why my parents stressed it so much. </sentence><sentence id="2465">And I never for once felt like God has failed me. </sentence><sentence id="2466">I felt the people failed me. </sentence><sentence id="2467">Because God gives men choices to do good or evil. </sentence><sentence id="2468">But they have chosen and they were the educated people. </sentence><sentence id="2469">My family always stressed education. . </sentence><sentence id="2470">In fact, my family used to say that is the highest form of religion, science and achievement. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I had a chance to find out that this was true. </sentence><sentence id="2472">Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees. </sentence><sentence id="2473">And he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family. </sentence><sentence id="2474">So I did not doubt God. </sentence><sentence id="2475">In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I remembered other things, which I didn't mentioned this story and I think I will now because I thought of that story often. </sentence><sentence id="2476">You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless of how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2477">It didn't matter whether you had a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2478">And most, and there was not big <span class="building">department stores</span> like this here, so mostly we would go to the <span class="building">dressmaker</span> to make a dress. </sentence><sentence id="2479">That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember my mother ordered for me navy blue . </sentence><sentence id="2480">And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two- piece dress, a <span class="spatial object">sailor dress</span>, a pleated skirt with the collar like this. </sentence><sentence id="2481">And when we went to try on first the measurements and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And then when the <span class="spatial object">dress</span> was ready I would try it on again and look in the <span class="interior space">mirror</span> and it fit well. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress. </sentence><sentence id="2484">The sailor dress. </sentence><sentence id="2485">And I came <span class="building">home</span> and it was early Passover, before Passover. </sentence><sentence id="2486">So, like a child, I wanted to put on the dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And when I was going to put on the dress, my mother said to me, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), please don't put on the dress now." </sentence><sentence id="2488">I said, "Oh Mom, it's gonna..." She said, "It might get tore and it might get stains and then you won't have it for Passover." </sentence><sentence id="2489">And I said, "Oh Mom, its going to be okay." </sentence><sentence id="2490">So I remember my mother said to me, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), please. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Don't take chances on something you can't afford to lose." </sentence><sentence id="2492">But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please. </sentence><sentence id="2493">So finally my mother said, she says, "Well, you learn about responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="2494">That's the only way you're going to learn." </sentence><sentence id="2495">And I promised I won't, I'll be careful. </sentence><sentence id="2496">And I had every intentions of doing it, it was not out of mischief or not caring. </sentence><sentence id="2497">And I put on the <span class="spatial object">dress</span> and I came out. </sentence><sentence id="2498">And I was very, a combination. </sentence><sentence id="2499">In one way I could be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you that we had the , the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And we use to go there, it had beautiful <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2501">And the kids came and somebody challenged, they said, "Who can climb up highest on the <span class="env feature">tree</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="2502">And I was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2503">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2504"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 pretty good at that, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2505">I was never heavy, which actually in <span class="country">Poland</span> that was not looked at favorably. </sentence><sentence id="2506">They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin. </sentence><sentence id="2507">People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this <span class="env feature">tree</span>, the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me. </sentence><sentence id="2508">And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, "<span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), <span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph) your mother is coming." </sentence><sentence id="2509">And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress. </sentence><sentence id="2510">And I went to get off the <span class="env feature">tree</span> fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a <span class="env feature">branch</span> and I tore the skirt. </sentence><sentence id="2511">I came down. </sentence><sentence id="2512">My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And I was in tears. </sentence><sentence id="2514">And I said, "My God. </sentence><sentence id="2515">My mother begged me not to take chances. </sentence><sentence id="2516">Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn." </sentence><sentence id="2517">And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear. </sentence><sentence id="2518">And when I came into the <span class="building">house</span> with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. </sentence><sentence id="2519">All she said, "Take of the skirt." </sentence><sentence id="2520">Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two together.

because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress. </sentence><sentence id="2527">But I remembered the lesson. </sentence><sentence id="2528">Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="2529">In every experience. </sentence><sentence id="2530">And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. </sentence><sentence id="2531">And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, is to lose my life. </sentence><sentence id="2532">So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. </sentence><sentence id="2535">And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had. </sentence><sentence id="2536">And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a Jewish community, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not, Jewish people were not the only people who were in <span

</sentence><sentence id="2539">The Polish girls were not together in the same <span class="building">barracks</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="2540">We were separated. </sentence><sentence

enough money for the next week. </sentence><sentence id="5391">And on our honeymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup. </sentence><sentence id="5392">And for a whole week, the four of us shared. </sentence><sentence id="5393">This was our condition in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="5394">And yet, I've tried to make a go of it and Binna and I made a switch. </sentence><sentence id="5395">I shared with her my <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) shared a little <span class="interior space">apartment</span> when they came from the other <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5396">So Binna went to live where Rockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in that little <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5397">You don't understand? </sentence><sentence id="5398">I had an <span class="interior

got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband. </sentence><sentence id="5401">And I lived with <span class="populated place">Rockmiel</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="5402">But there is something that, it's a curious thing, because I learn a lot from people. </sentence><sentence id="5403">When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people. </sentence><sentence id="5404">So there was only Binna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in <span class="populated place">Boss</span> (ph), that I didn't know from before. </sentence><sentence id="5405">One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at that time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married. </sentence><sentence id="5406">She was a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and not everybody wanted to marry out of their religion. </sentence><sentence id="5407">So anyhow, we had a tiny <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5408">All there was in the <span class="interior space">room</span> is two <span class="spatial object">single beds</span>, a <span class="spatial object">table</span> and a couple of <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5409">I didn't even have a <span class="spatial object">stove</span> in the <span class="interior space">room</span> so we went to going from the <span class="dlf">steps</span>, to go up to the first <span class="interior space">floor</span>, I took a little, made a little curtain or drape and I bought a hot plate. </sentence><sentence id="5410">And that's how I cooked. </sentence><sentence id="5411">And from the <span class="spatial object">sink</span> that we used. </sentence><sentence id="5412">But I was satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="5413">So I went out to bring in the food. </sentence><sentence id="5414">Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my fiancee when we got engaged, and she says to me, "Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you." </sentence><sentence id="5415">And I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="5416">And she said, "He's too big a flirt." </sentence><sentence id="5417">And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with facts. </sentence><sentence id="5418">How would she know what he is, she just met him? </sentence><sentence id="5419">She would say he's not attractive, she can see, but how can she know he's a flirt? </sentence><sentence id="5420">He's never, she never met him before. </sentence><sentence id="5421">So I just ignored. </sentence><sentence id="5422">After we were married, my husband asked me, "Are you good friends?" </sentence><sentence id="5423">And I said, "Just met her." </sentence><sentence id="5424">But I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement. </sentence><sentence id="5425">So he said, "Did you know that when you went out to , She invited me to come to her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> without you?" </sentence><sentence id="5426">I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this. </sentence><sentence id="5427">And I thought to myself, you see how important is the thing for yourself. </sentence><sentence id="5428">To think what people say and use your own common sense. </sentence><sentence id="5429">This is why I'm telling you the story. </sentence><sentence id="5430">Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was working very hard. </sentence><sentence id="5431">And Mendle (ph) told me how hard he's working so I was upset about it so I went and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get a better job. </sentence><sentence id="5432">And I should get <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, to get a little bigger <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5433">And we were in <span class="country">Sweden</span> and we didn't have anything, we started without anything. </sentence><sentence id="5434">But we understood that it's a beginning and we worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="5435">And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whether I'll be able to bear a child. </sentence><sentence id="5436">Because I didn't get the period yet for so long. </sentence><sentence id="5437">Finally I got the period. </sentence><sentence id="5438">And anyhow, we got an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5439">And you know, I'm telling you those stories because I'm seeing that all over, in every <span class="country">country</span> and in every religion, and even in every <span class="building">home</span>, there can be people who are good or not so good. </sentence><sentence id="5440">So anyhow, we had an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and this, in this <span class="building">house</span> where I had the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> from this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any children in that <span class="building">home</span>, in that place. </sentence><sentence id="5441">Because there were only living people without children. </sentence><sentence id="5442">Mostly elderly people. </sentence><sentence id="5443">And she put in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> two <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, <span class="spatial object">single beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5444">And one time, at night, I hear somebody is opening the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5445">She came to check if we are sleeping together, and here I am married. </sentence><sentence id="5446">And I always, I don't know so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as I can remember, I was taught to think for myself and to trust myself. </sentence><sentence id="5447">And my parents always gave me confidence, you know, that I had that, that I was able to trust myself. </sentence><sentence id="5448">So I figured, let her say

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 what she wants. </sentence><sentence id="5451">I didn't argue, I didn't talk back. </sentence><sentence id="5452">And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant, in that place. </sentence><sentence id="5453">But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable. </sentence><sentence id="5454">So again, I had to switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were murdered. </sentence><sentence id="5455">And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child. </sentence><sentence id="5456">Here I'm pregnant and somebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child. </sentence><sentence id="5457">I need her permission? </sentence><sentence id="5458">So I started to look for an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to get, to keep the moving again. </sentence><sentence id="5459">Anyhow, when, before, when I moved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5460">And I didn't know anything about how the human body works. </sentence><sentence id="5461">A woman's body. </sentence><sentence id="5462">And the doctor just told me the date, when to expect. </sentence><sentence id="5463">And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come. </sentence><sentence id="5464">All the time my husband and I was rehearsing. </sentence><sentence id="5465">Where we going to go? </sentence><sentence id="5466">How we going to go?Everything. </sentence><sentence id="5467">It so happened he had still shift work. </sentence><sentence id="5468">And he left in the morning and I woke up and my water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="5469">I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before. </sentence><sentence id="5470">So I go in, I don't have a friend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask. </sentence><sentence id="5471">So I go into a neighbor, to ask her, what does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="5472">She said, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5473">Go ask the doctor." </sentence><sentence id="5474">So she's advising me to go ask the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="5475">My husband is not <span class="building">home</span>, I don't have a telephone number. </sentence><sentence id="5476">And here I see something is not right and I don't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="5477">So I take my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I'm going on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> to ask the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="5478">And here my <span class="spatial object">water bag</span> is broken. </sentence><sentence id="5479">And I came to the doctor and they don't let me go <span class="building">home</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="5480">In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one thing influences the other. </sentence><sentence id="5481">And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and they ask him, how is <span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby. </sentence><sentence id="5482">And here I was a little bit . </sentence><sentence id="5483">Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, that the water bag broke. </sentence><sentence id="5484">And he tells her the story. </sentence><sentence id="5485">So she says, "Well, if the <span class="spatial object">water bag</span> broke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live." </sentence><sentence id="5486">In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy boy and my husband comes to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face. </sentence><sentence

behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them because she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="5496">So I'm showing you, why am I telling you this story? </sentence><sentence id="5497">I had no experience. </sentence><sentence id="5498">I was alone. </sentence><sentence id="5499">That when I needed somebody, a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6413">A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions. </sentence><sentence id="6414">And I answered. </sentence><sentence id="6415">I always, I did the same thing like I did with my children when they asked about sex. </sentence><sentence id="6416">Short question, short answer. </sentence><sentence id="6417">They asked me so I answered. </sentence><sentence id="6418">And people, not too many people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="6419">And then, a little later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6420">They speak about World War One but not about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="6421">So we started to form an organization and be involved with this here. </sentence><sentence id="6422">So it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="6423">Because, to give you one example, with some people it was easier. </sentence><sentence id="6424">Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding and more curious. </sentence><sentence id="6425">Others are more involved with their own life. </sentence><sentence id="6426">So it depends who it was. </sentence><sentence id="6427">I had my late friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she started to tell a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="6428">She said, "Well, we had that in <span class="country">America</span> hard too. </sentence><sentence id="6429">We didn't have any steak." </sentence><sentence id="6430">And after that she decided never to talk about the Holocaust to her. </sentence><sentence id="6431">The Holocaust has taught me many lessons. </sentence><sentence id="6432">Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. </sentence><sentence id="6433">I had no frame of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. </sentence><sentence id="6434">The blessing of a loving family. </sentence><sentence id="6435">The blessing of good health. </sentence><sentence id="6436">The blessing of having my <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6437">Not to be called all different names. </sentence><sentence id="6438">Because I've been called all kinds of names. </sentence><sentence id="6439">I've been called no name at all. </sentence><sentence id="6440">I've been called, derogatory now, Jewess, which was anti-Semitic name. </sentence><sentence id="6441">I was called you refugee. </sentence><sentence id="6442">You foreigner. </sentence><sentence id="6443">All kinds of name. </sentence><sentence id="6444">And I feel one thing, that its very important. </sentence><sentence id="6445">Respect for one another. </sentence><sentence id="6446">Respect for differences. </sentence><sentence id="6447">That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. </sentence><sentence id="6448">And that we must, I don't want to use the word must because that sounds dictatorial. </sentence><sentence id="6449">It's important to protect our human rights. </sentence><sentence id="6450">And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened. </sentence><sentence id="6451">When somebody does not treat you right. </sentence><sentence id="6452">I have learned to become a . </sentence><sentence id="6453">I want to give you an example because that's going to be more. </sentence><sentence id="6454">I was invited several years ago to an open <span class="building">house</span>, a <span class="spatial object">barbecue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6455">And the barbecue started because there was some people who were suppose to come from other <span class="populated place">cities</span> too, it was like a big gathering. </sentence><sentence id="6456">They started to come on Friday until Sunday evening. </sentence><sentence id="6457">We came Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="6458">We live, it wasn't in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6459">And when we arrived, not the owner but one of the guests greeting me with anger. " </sentence><sentence id="6460">What's the matter? </sentence><sentence id="6461">Why so late?" </sentence><sentence id="6462">At that time I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is controlling me emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="6463">So I looked at him very calmly and I said, "Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="6464">I am so glad that you missed me." </sentence><sentence id="6465">And he answered, "You know I like you <span class="populated place">Yit-cola</span> (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="6466">And I said, "Thank you" again. </sentence><sentence id="6467">This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive. </sentence><sentence id="6468">He was otherwise a good man, but he had a habit of putting some people down. </sentence><sentence id="6469">And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in the group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="6470">And this is nothing to do with race, color or religion. </sentence><sentence id="6471">It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love yourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself. </sentence><sentence id="6472">And to care. </sentence><sentence id="6473">To know that what we do effects not only us, it effects others too. </sentence><sentence id="6474">Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many times, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my parents and grandmother made for me. </sentence><sentence id="6475">You know children don't make where to live and what to do, of course I had some. </sentence><sentence id="6476">During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my

could have said no, I don't want to come here. </sentence><sentence id="6481">But I didn't have many choices. </sentence><sentence id="6482">I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because the . </sentence><sentence id="6483">So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices which others made that effected me. </sentence><sentence id="6484">And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words. </sentence><sentence id="6485">And it goes like this: Four groups of people Dramatically influence my destiny. </sentence><sentence id="6486">My late, beloved family in <span class="populated place">Check-hon-off</span> (ph), <span class="country">Poland</span> Who knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy. </sentence><sentence id="6487">Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day Murdered in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> my entire family. </sentence><sentence id="6488">The bystanders, who knew but didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="6489">And the <span class="building">Swedish Red Cross</span>, who didn't know me but

</sentence><sentence id="6491">If four different groups of people viewed me differently, And treated me differently, I was loved for who I am And I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am. </sentence><sentence id="6492">The more the Nazis tortured me for who I am The more I was determined never to become like them, But to view myself through their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="6493">To the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin. </sentence><sentence id="6494">But I am not a number. </sentence><sentence id="6495">My number is my badge of honor. </sentence><sentence id="6496">Let those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.lam a proud Jewish daughter. </sentence><sentence id="6497">To be born Jewish is neither a crime nor a disgrace, But to starve, torture and murder innocent people For being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity. </sentence><sentence id="6498">A crime that has influenced the entire world. </sentence><sentence id="6499">Because whatever we choose to say and do We are becoming partners too. </sentence><sentence id="6500">But others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds Or the victims of our evil deeds. </sentence><sentence id="6501">We each can make a difference. </sentence><sentence id="6502">One person can save many people And one person can destroy many people. </sentence><sentence id="6503">Mengelia is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="6504">On the other hand, <span class="building">Wahlenberg</span> and even <span

taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and I'll help him and others. </sentence><sentence id="6510">And I know one thing, we live in this world We are responsible for one another. </sentence><sentence id="6511">But not in a way to punish each other. </sentence><sentence id="6512">So whenever there is injustice and cruelty We need to be, to speak out, no matter
