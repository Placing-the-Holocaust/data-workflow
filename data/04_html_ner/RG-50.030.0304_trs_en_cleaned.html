<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Shall I start or not? </sentence><sentence id="6">Very good. </sentence><sentence id="7">Well, my real name is , my present  I did participate in the September campaign. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was in the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span>, also an artillary unit, and on, in the middle of September I was taken prisoner by the Germans at the battle of . </sentence><sentence id="9">It so happened that I was in the same <span class="spatial object">transport</span> with the future communist  Q. How much did you know or think about what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> about the Nazism that was really starting to take form about Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="10">How was that perceived? </sentence><sentence id="11">A. Well, I remember when Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="12">They were, we were scared. </sentence><sentence id="13">This was the first time we realized that maybe a war. </sentence><sentence id="14">We knew all he wrote, I mean, and this was considered to be a threat. </sentence><sentence id="15">I do remember maybe in "38 or "37 some Jews who escaped from <span class="country">Germany</span> into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">I remember I, when I was on, on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Posznan</span> to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> that I talked to a, to an elderly Jew who just escaped from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and he was telling me all about it. </sentence><sentence id="17">Q. What was the general attitude in <span class="populated place">Posznan</span> and in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> towards the Nazis? </sentence><sentence id="18">A. Well, you know, to us Nazis were Germans and Germans were Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="19">And Germans were enemies. </sentence><sentence id="20">Germans were considered to be enemies. </sentence><sentence id="21">So at that time really we considered every German is a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="22">You see it was over simplification, but this is how we... And after all, the support for Hitler was overwhelming in <span class="country">Germany</span>, that we couldn't see any difference. </sentence><sentence id="23">We considered Germans as a big threat to us and that's from my young age, because Germans did want to take back the <span class="region">territories</span> which they lost to <span class="country">Poland</span> after the war and they were always considered the greatest threat to us. </sentence><sentence id="24">But until the end of the war really we didn't differentiate much between the Germans and the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="25">Q. In this distrust of the Germans was really a very separate than the, their ideas about genocide. </sentence><sentence id="26">A. Well, you know genocide came late. </sentence><sentence id="27">Remember they were of course victims of Nazis in <span class="country">Germany</span> itself and in <span class="country">Poland</span>, I mean, the number of people that were executed was considerable. </sentence><sentence id="28">I lost my uncle who was executed in October "39, but this was not genocide. </sentence><sentence id="29">In the sense that came later. </sentence><sentence id="30">The genocide of Jews did come, happen in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="31">This is when it started. </sentence><sentence id="32">There was extermination of Poles and of Jews, but this was not a sort of a total extermination of race or religion of people who belonged to the race or to the religion. </sentence><sentence id="33">Many victims, there was a German terror. </sentence><sentence id="34">Q. Early on it was very clear that the Germans weren't, were going to try to eliminate Jewish people in one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="35">Your distrust of Germans and Nazis was more territorial? </sentence><sentence id="36">A. Well, as far as Jews are concerned during the war, no. </sentence><sentence id="37">Nobody really anticipated that there will be a sort of a total extermination of every Jew. </sentence><sentence id="38">That came later. </sentence><sentence id="39">We knew that Jews are persecuted, that they are discriminated, that they are being killed, but the final solution in the sense that every Jew had to be killed because the crime he committed was that he was alive, that came later. </sentence><sentence id="40">Q. l understand that. </sentence><sentence id="41">I was trying to distinguish between you as a catholic Pole disliking or distrusting or hating the Germans as something separate than because they were persecuting the Jews and other minorities. </sentence><sentence id="42">A. Well, they were persecuting Poles, they were, they were, of course, but it was all, we abhored it. </sentence><sentence id="43">This was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="44">But we in the first stages we considered the persecution of Jews as the part of Nazism, of atrocities that they were committing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="45">Of course I felt great sympathy for my Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="46">I remember, you know, when I came back from, when I escaped from captivity and we were living in the <span class="dlf">apartment block</span>, during the war people became  very close to each other. </sentence><sentence id="47">We were no longer neighbors who didn't know what the other neighbor was doing. </sentence><sentence id="48">They were very close. </sentence><sentence id="49">And there was Antoni living in our block of <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">A very nice man who was Jewish, and then they were all requested to leave the so-called <span class="populated place">Aryan district</span> and to move to,to the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">And he was struggling with himself. </sentence><sentence id="52">Should he go to the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span> to move there or buy the, or get the legal papers and stay outside, which he felt was much more risky because this was a violation of law and every Jew that was caught outside the <span class="populated place">district</span> would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="53">So, I, I remember how this man was fighting with each other, with, with himself. </sentence><sentence id="54">Should he and his family move to the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> or pretend he was, he was a Christian, and he finally decided to go there and probably that was his, his end eventually. </sentence><sentence id="55">Q. Would there have been support among the Polish community for Jewish people who needed to, who wanted to stay outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and hide? </sentence><sentence id="56">A. Well, they, they, the best way it was described was by Jan Karski (?) </sentence><sentence id="57">who just said there were people of bad will. </sentence><sentence id="58">There were people of good will and there were indifferent people. </sentence><sentence id="59">And this is exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="60">The bad people who were denouncing Jews very often for, for gain, for money, and people who were risking their lives to save Jews. </sentence><sentence id="61">Both were in minority. </sentence><sentence id="62">The great majority were indifferent people. </sentence><sentence id="63">You know, people who were, cared only how to survive, how to survive with their families. </sentence><sentence id="64">And this was not just something in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">I mean, the world was indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="66">Even the Jews in <span class="country">U.S.</span> we knew were indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="67">But unfortunately most of the people cared about themselves. </sentence><sentence id="68">They were indifferent, but they were a great force to save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="69">For instance, I know somebody who was active in some organization that dealt with the Germans and he was trying to get from the Germans special kind of permits for Christians of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="70">And the Germans said of course, give us the list we will give them special immunity. </sentence><sentence id="71">They will be able to move out and you know what happened? </sentence><sentence id="72">In the best of faith, he offered them the list. </sentence><sentence id="73">All of them were arrested and sent to, to <span class="building">jail</span> and probably executed. </sentence><sentence id="74">But there were efforts to, to rescue. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was not easy, I will tell you. </sentence><sentence id="76">I remember my own experience. </sentence><sentence id="77">In the first year of war, we had to now livings and there was a tremendous shortage of food so everybody was smuggling food from the <span class="region">countryside</span>, from peasants. </sentence><sentence id="78">And I was one of them, so I traveled to the estate of my uncle which was east from <span class="country">Poland</span> and was getting some butter or some, even vodka which I would change for something else. </sentence><sentence id="79">And there were <span class="spatial object">trains</span> that were full of smugglers. </sentence><sentence id="80">This was, as I say, first months of war. </sentence><sentence id="81">This <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were dilapidated without, you know, <span class="dlf">windows</span> where, where the glass was smashed. </sentence><sentence id="82">It was cold and all that, and I was alone in my <span class="interior space">compartment</span>, but in the next <span class="interior space">compartment</span> was a Jewish girl and there was some typical <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> hooligans who started to be aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="83">And instinctively she came to me and said, "Protect me. </sentence><sentence id="84">They are hooligans." </sentence><sentence id="85">I scolded them and they let her alone. </sentence><sentence id="86">She was sitting next to me. </sentence><sentence id="87">Now, at that time, the Jews were not yet in closed <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, but using of the <span class="spatial object">public transport</span> was forbidden and any Jew caught in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, in the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, would be executed. </sentence><sentence id="88">And she was a beautiful girl, maybe 19, 20, but with very characteristic Jewish features. </sentence><sentence id="89">You could, one look is enough to know she is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="90">She was very thankful. </sentence><sentence id="91">We talked and said, "But, you know, I have to ask you one more favor." </sentence><sentence id="92">I said, "What is it?" " </sentence><sentence id="93">Well, when we come  to , to the <span class="building">station</span>, we have to go through the <span class="dlf">schpera</span> (ph)," in other words, <span class="dlf">exit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94"> because of what? </sentence><sentence id="95">Because some German was killed or something happened and they would be executed. </sentence><sentence id="96">So, that people came to a conclusion very soon that it doesn't matter if you are in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> or not if you are passive or if you are active in the anti-German movement. </sentence><sentence id="97">It's a matter of accident. </sentence><sentence id="98">You may be surrounded on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, there were this, and either deported to <span class="country">Germany</span> as a forced labor, or to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99"><span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was established in 1940 as a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for Polish inmates. </sentence><sentence id="100">The first 700 inmates of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> were Poles, mostly Polish intelligencia, but we got used to the terror. </sentence><sentence id="101">Very few people were really afraid because it was daily bread. </sentence><sentence id="102">You simply had to co exist with, with, with the possibility that you may be arrested, killed and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="103">It became something, part of life. </sentence><sentence id="104">Q. Was there much evidence of brutality? </sentence><sentence id="105">A. There was. </sentence><sentence id="106">There was people who were beaten on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and the police, the gestapo would come to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">They would start by beating people. </sentence><sentence id="108">Of course the worst of it all was the treatment of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="109">It was gradual. </sentence><sentence id="110">You see, they were, first they were requested to wear David Stars, yellow band. </sentence><sentence id="111">Then they were requested to move to the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">But the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span> was not yet closed, so they lived there but they could move around. </sentence><sentence id="113">Later it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="114">The <span class="dlf">wall</span> was built around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and initially Christians were not allowed without special pass to go into <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but the <span class="spatial object">street cars</span> were crossing the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in a transit to other <span class="region">districts</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">And Ido remember. </sentence><sentence id="116">You know this was the time probably "41 when <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was isolated and people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were simply hungry. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were starving. </sentence><sentence id="118">And the <span class="dlf">streets</span> were covered by corpses, covered by newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="119">People who died from spotted fever mostly or from starvation and the family had no means to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="120">They would just put the body on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span> and cover it with the newspaper and the <span class="spatial object">car</span> would come simply from, from municipal. </sentence><sentence id="121">So it was--piles of these bodies were put on the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and taken to some common grave. </sentence><sentence id="122">But the, the view was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="123">People were like skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="124">Young, young Jews who really looked awful, I mean, living skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="125">You could see that the people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="126">Q. When you went through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on a <span class="spatial object">street car</span>, did people ever try to call out for help?A. Very, no, because <span class="spatial object">street cars</span> were going pretty fast. </sentence><sentence id="127">There was no chance to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="128">But, some Jews were, in spite of the great risk of losing life, they were coming for help. </sentence><sentence id="129">I remember, I will never forget it, I will never forget it, you know, probably it was "41 when we were living in a good <span class="region">residential area</span> and the girl, Jewish girl who was no more than 10 came with a small brother who was five and said, "We are very hungry." </sentence><sentence id="130">And it was something I will never forget, to see the child who say, "I am hungry." </sentence><sentence id="131">Q. Were you able to help her? </sentence><sentence id="132">A. My mother gave her bread, soup and said, "Come whenever you want, whenever you are hungry." </sentence><sentence id="133">They never came back. </sentence><sentence id="134">Nobody knows what happened. </sentence><sentence id="135"> Q. Did you have any other experiences in seeing what was happening in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or knowing about it? </sentence><sentence id="136">A. Well, we know, we knew, but later we were isolated. </sentence><sentence id="137">I mean you could see the groups of Jews who were under, mostly under the escort of the police going to work and of course they were trying to get food and they were getting food, potatoes and bread and all that. </sentence><sentence id="138">But the police, German police, would take away everything from them and beat them when they were coming back. </sentence><sentence id="139">Still, they were trying to get food, coming back. </sentence><sentence id="140">But what was inside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we didn't know because it was a <span class="dlf">wall</span>, total isolation. </sentence><sentence id="141">Q. Now, your family was able to stay together? </sentence><sentence id="142">A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="143">Q. Was there semblance of normal life for you? </sentence><sentence id="144">A. The life was always normal even life in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was normal. </sentence><sentence id="145">There were <span class="building">coffee houses</span>, there were <span class="building">theaters</span>, concerts everything in the <span class="populated place">city</span> condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="146">Life is always normal you know. </sentence><sentence id="147">People, children were playing. </sentence><sentence id="148">Also even in the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> so there was some normal life, family life. </sentence><sentence id="149">Everybody was trying to get his, eh, and for his life and all that. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="151">Life in danger, life in terror, life in poverty, in shortages, but it was a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="152">More or less. </sentence><sentence id="153">Q. Generally, in the <span class="populated place">community</span> not so much when you chose to go in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, was there any support for the German occupation? </sentence><sentence id="154">A. Very few. </sentence><sentence id="155">There were always, you know, in every <span class="populated place">community</span> you have people who will cooperate and collaborate and denounce people, but frankly you know it was the Germans who united people. </sentence><sentence id="156">Since the, every <span class="env feature">Pole</span> was, you know, also condemned. </sentence><sentence id="157">People because of this terror, they really became very, they got used to it, but they were united. </sentence><sentence id="158">There was a common <span class="dlf">anti-German front</span>, no question. </sentence><sentence id="159">And we had no questling (?) </sentence><sentence id="160">government, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="161">And collaborators were shot. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean, the people who collaborated with Germans were killed. </sentence><sentence id="163">By, they got sentences of death and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="164">The <span class="interior space">underground</span> was very ruthless with collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was a risky thing to collaborate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="166">Q. Your government was --? </sentence><sentence id="167">A. There was, of course, administration was German. </sentence><sentence id="168">They were some <span class="building">offices</span> for instance, <span class="building">city offices</span> Poles were employed. </sentence><sentence id="169">Germans had no manpower. </sentence><sentence id="170">They had used their manpower for war industry and, and in the <span class="region">front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, they did use Poles but it was different thing to work in the, in the administration. </sentence><sentence id="172">It was not collaboration. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was not considered--as long as you were not used as an instrument to persecute others. </sentence><sentence id="174">So, of course they were, they were <span class="building">offices</span>, <span class="building">labor offices</span> or <span class="building">municipal authorities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">The same was in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">The Jews were employed by the, by the German authorities in all kinds of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="177">Q. In your prewar government? </sentence><sentence id="178">A. Was in <span class="populated place">London</span>, but we did have an <span class="building">underground authority</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">It was a kind of <span class="region">underground state</span> which was kind of moral authority, you know. </sentence><sentence id="180">People did obey the orders that came from our <span class="building">underground government</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">Commander and chief of the Polish Home army of the <span class="building">military  underground</span> and there was so called delegation of the government in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">And they did have considerable authority. </sentence><sentence id="183">Q. Which was respected by the <span class="populated place">civilian community</span>? </sentence><sentence id="184">A. They were respected, yes. </sentence><sentence id="185">Q. And the <span class="interior space">underground</span> worked in conjunction with the government in <span class="populated place">London</span>? </sentence><sentence id="186">A. Well, there was daily communication by secret radios with the government in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">There were couriers, emissaries. </sentence><sentence id="188">So, there was a contact and above all Polish radio from <span class="populated place">London</span> and <span class="building">BBC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">After all, everybody, it was daily bread, news from <span class="populated place">London</span>, information from <span class="populated place">London</span>, programs broadcast from <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">It was a source of hope. </sentence><sentence id="191">Q. Can you tell me a little bit about the circumstances how you got involved with the <span class="interior space">underground</span>? </sentence><sentence id="192">A. Well first I established some contact with some underground paper, but it was sort of a conservative paper which I didn't like very much, but there was no choice. </sentence><sentence id="193">I mean, I had no other contacts. </sentence><sentence id="194">But in "41 I did, I met somebody who really introduced me into the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and I joined so called Action Ann which was psychological warfare against the Nazis, against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="195">We produced <span class="spatial object">German underground press</span>, by, which was prepared by excellent experts. </sentence><sentence id="196">Mostly by Poles, who were bilingual, spoke as good German as Polish. </sentence><sentence id="197">And this was, we were pretending to be German newspapers which did create a sensation in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And it was never distributed from hands to hands because it would betray Polish souls. </sentence><sentence id="199">It was distributed by dropping on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> or inside the book, inside the parcels that were sent to the soldiers in the front, in the <span class="building">restaurants</span>, in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">And my, my function was to organize distribution of this <span class="building">black propaganda press</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, I didn't know German very well, very, just a few words, but there were so many Poles who became German, so-called volksdeutsch who didn't speak good German that it was not so bad as you may think. </sentence><sentence id="202">SO, I had to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span> of so called <span class="building">Generalgouvernement</span>, which was <span class="region">central Poland</span>, isolated from the rest of, of <span class="country">Germany</span>, of <span class="region">occupied Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">And I had to find agents inside <span class="country">Germany</span> who were distributing this, this subversive literature. </sentence><sentence id="204">Which was a fascinating job. </sentence><sentence id="205">I traveled under disguise of Polish railway man and then German railway man which was the safest way to travel with forged documents of course. </sentence><sentence id="206">And that lasted until the spring of "43. </sentence><sentence id="207">In "43 I discovered the possibility to go to <span class="country">Sweden</span> hidden in the <span class="spatial object">Swedish ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">Swedes were importing iron ore to Germans and were taking coal from, from <span class="country">Poland</span>, from <span class="region">Polish territories</span> and I was put in touch with some people from the <span class="interior space">underground</span> who could place a blind passenger in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> of coal. </sentence><sentence id="209">So, I reported to my authorities and volunteered to go in this manner. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I became a courier. </sentence><sentence id="211">I was traveling with intelligence reports hidden in the <span class="spatial object">microfilms</span> and all kinds of <span class="spatial object">objects</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">And after some adventures I did reach <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> and that was just at the time of the uprising in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213"> And I learned about it by listening to the <span class="spatial object">Polish radio</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span> which was in touch with the secret radio in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">So, they were getting daily reports and I was very impressed by this and I remember I wrote a report about genocide of Jews to a Polish commander and chief and Prime Minister General Chicovsky (?), </sentence><sentence id="215">and were urging him that the allies must make some kind of threats of reprisals to Germans to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="216">And if they will not do anything, well Poles will be next. </sentence><sentence id="217">I used this, this argument, that if Germans will be completely, could, without any penalty, murder three million Jews then next after them will be Poles. </sentence><sentence id="218">And I know that report did reach the addressee and was passed over, passed on to <span class="populated place">Churchill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I was told after the war that it did have some influence. </sentence><sentence id="220">I think the, this decision to bring war criminals before the <span class="building">international tribunal</span> was done more or less at that time. </sentence><sentence id="221">What I was really asking for was to have a kind of bombing which would be declared as a reprisal for mass murders of Jews, and I remember I used the argument you, you, the Americans and British are going to bomb the Germans anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="222">Why not to say this is an act of reprisal. </sentence><sentence id="223">No, nothing like that ever happened. </sentence><sentence id="224">So, I came back from <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> and I was immediately commissioned to go this same <span class="dlf">route</span> but to <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">And at that time they put me in touch with a man in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> who was in a contact man with the Jewish military organization in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, by the name of Henry Valinsky (2). </sentence><sentence id="226">And I was under instructions to get as much briefing about the Holocaust as it is called now. </sentence><sentence id="227">We didn't use this word at that time, about the Jewish uprising and to consider it a sort of a priority in my mission to <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">And I did spend much time with Volinsky who told me all about the problems with even names of some militants, and I got microfilms and I was the man who brought to <span class="populated place">London</span> a report , a Jewish Militant Organization, written after the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">I remember when I was boarding <span class="spatial object">train</span> on my way to port <span class="populated place">Gdansk</span> to go to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, the messenger came and gave me, I believe it was a battery or something, you know, battery for a torch and said, "You have to take it, this is a report, the story of the extermination of Jews and of the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> Ghetto uprising." </sentence><sentence id="230">And it was -- I didn't know really exactly what it was until I reached <span class="populated place">London</span> and the film was developed and it was a very impressive story written by the woman writer called Kahn, K-A-H-N. "P , Before the Eyes  0 Jews, about the atrocities and all that's going on and identify yourself. </sentence><sentence id="231">Give your number, your regiment and all that and I will ask that it's microfilmed and we'll send it to <span class="building">London Times</span>." </sentence><sentence id="232">And it was developed, the <span class="spatial object">microfilm</span> was developed, and the Polish government sent it to <span class="building">London Times</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">They never published it. </sentence><sentence id="234">So when I met archbishop Temple who was the archbishop of <span class="populated place">Canterbury</span>, head of the <span class="building">underground church</span>, he was really a good man and he was just not asking what can I do for you in the sense which implied, I can do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="235">He just asked the question. </sentence><sentence id="236">In the good sense, "Can I do something?," </sentence><sentence id="237">and I said, "Well, you know, use your influence you are the second person after the king." </sentence><sentence id="238">Send my letter to the <span class="building">Times</span> and ask why they didn't publish it. </sentence><sentence id="239">Use your influence to, with the <span class="building">Times</span> to have this letter published. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I have his answer. </sentence><sentence id="241">I have his answer here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, the original letter. </sentence><sentence id="242">He says, "Mr.Nowak, I am sorry. </sentence><sentence id="243">Nothing to be done. </sentence><sentence id="244"><span class="building">London Times</span> say they can not publish the letter because it could endanger the man in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and the British POWs," which was nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="245">I mean he was one of I don't know how many thousand people living with the forged documents. </sentence><sentence id="246">Nobody could, how could the Germans find him? </sentence><sentence id="247">And I told about it Walter Laquer (?) </sentence><sentence id="248">when he was writing his books, and he approached <span class="populated place">London</span>, <span class="building">London Times</span> and said, "Do you have this letter in your archives?" </sentence><sentence id="249">They said, "No, the letter was destroyed," which is not true. </sentence><sentence id="250">I mean a letter smuggled from the occupied <span class="country">Poland</span> from a British prisoner of war was a curiosity. </sentence><sentence id="251">I'm sure they would keep it. </sentence><sentence id="252">They didn't want to admit they had this kind of letter and then publish it. </sentence><sentence id="253">Q. Now, I want to back track a little bit and learn more about the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, the <span class="building">Polish underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">What motivated you to get involved? </sentence><sentence id="255">A. Patriotic duty. </sentence><sentence id="256">I mean, I was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="257">I was the officer. </sentence><sentence id="258">I mean, it was my duty to fight on. </sentence><sentence id="259">That was the motivation of people who joined the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">Q. From where did all these people come? </sentence><sentence id="261">A. All walks of life, absolutely all walks of life. </sentence><sentence id="262">The <span class="region">countryside</span>--the peasants were extremely well-organized. </sentence><sentence id="263">For instance you know parachuting, <span class="spatial object">parachutes</span>, they got special committees by the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="264">They were peasant battalions, partisan units, guerrilla, intelligencia, they, they, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="265">If somebody was not in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> he was at least trying to help in some way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="266">But it was a conspiracy of the entire <span class="country">nation</span> I would say. </sentence><sentence id="267">There were very few people who were not involved in this or other way. </sentence><sentence id="268">Which does not mean that organization itself probably would be no more than 100,000 but it had tremendous <span class="region">hinterland</span> (?) </sentence><sentence id="269">of people supporting it, whether by offering hiding place or helping in any way they could. </sentence><sentence id="270">So, that even if I didn't know a passerby I could approach him and say, "Look, help me." </sentence><sentence id="271">And it was a fantastic experience. </sentence><sentence id="272">I remember when German closed the <span class="dlf">street</span> because there was some attempt on the, attack on the <span class="building">SA unit</span>, marching, this, hand grenade was thrown. </sentence><sentence id="273">I was inside the <span class="building">apartment house</span> with some other people on the conspiracy. </sentence><sentence id="274">We were  1 told that everything is quiet. </sentence><sentence id="275">We can leave. </sentence><sentence id="276">I was the first one who left and when I was leaving the <span class="building">house</span> the gestapo man stopped me and he said, "Where did you come from?" </sentence><sentence id="277">I knew if I say which <span class="interior space">apartment</span> the rest of my colleagues including my finance were there. </sentence><sentence id="278">So over his shoulder I saw the name of a dentist and I said I left the dentist's <span class="interior space">room</span> and I gave her name. </sentence><sentence id="279">He took me to the nearest <span class="building">pharmacy</span>, picked up the phone and called the dentist with my identity card and said, "Was a man by this name in your <span class="interior space">room</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="280">I thought that's the end. </sentence><sentence id="281">He put down the received you can go. </sentence><sentence id="282">She said yes of course he was. </sentence><sentence id="283">He, I never saw the lady. </sentence><sentence id="284">She never saw me, but she was in this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">She knew what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="286">So, yes, of course he was in, he was my patient. </sentence><sentence id="287">He was in my <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">This was the kind of conspiracy where everybody was trying to help and assist. </sentence><sentence id="289">I lost ticket, a ticket when I was with my compromising material. </sentence><sentence id="290">I approached a worker who had a season railway ticket and I asked him could you please buy me a ticket because I cannot go through the <span class="dlf">schpera</span> (?) </sentence><sentence id="291">without the ticket. </sentence><sentence id="292">Of course he didn't know who I was. </sentence><sentence id="293">He went, bought the ticket and brought me the ticket. </sentence><sentence id="294">I left the <span class="building">railway station</span> safely. </sentence><sentence id="295">So everywhere there was some kind assistance. </sentence><sentence id="296">That's why we would act. </sentence><sentence id="297">Q. Did the organization of the <span class="interior space">underground</span> evolve out of prewar political organizations? </sentence><sentence id="298">A. It evolved spontaneously. </sentence><sentence id="299">They were really secret organizations which were mushrooming after the defeat of <span class="country">Poland</span> everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="300">At the same time the commanding officers were appointed by our authorities in <span class="populated place">London</span> and they were trying to unite this whole kind of spontaneous organization into one underground force and they managed to do so. </sentence><sentence id="301">But the initiative would come from <span class="region">grass roots</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">Q. Were there any Jews in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>? </sentence><sentence id="303">A. Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="304">I mean, for instance my <span class="building">school</span> mate, a little older Lucian 2 was in, in the, in my, very close to me in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="305">Jusak (?) </sentence><sentence id="306">Handelsman, he's, he's, professor Handelsman, who was killed by the Germans later. </sentence><sentence id="307">I could name several other people. </sentence><sentence id="308">Yes, there were some Jews in the underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="309">Q. Not a lot? </sentence><sentence id="310">A. Not many because, because you know there was, this was a terrific danger. </sentence><sentence id="311">You know, the man <span class="building">Lucian 2</span> for instance, was, had very Jewish features. </sentence><sentence id="312">Now if he would  2 we don't resist, if we simply carry out orders, some will be killed and some will survive. </sentence><sentence id="313">This was a wrong philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="314">And the first really Jewish militant units were formed only after this big wave of extermination at the end of "42. </sentence><sentence id="315">And then they were trying to establish contact with us and to get weapons. </sentence><sentence id="316">Now, initially the Polish military were reluctant because they were not sure if they will fight but later they have shown tremendous determination and they did get weapons. </sentence><sentence id="317">Not enough, not sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="318">They were always complaining they don't get enough. </sentence><sentence id="319">But also not only weapons because we were very short of weapons until British started really to throw a lot of weapons since April "44. </sentence><sentence id="320">But we were for instance, I know that the Poles were giving them contacts to the, where they could buy weapons from Germans. </sentence><sentence id="321">It was a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="322">There were many German soldiers who were selling their weapons. </sentence><sentence id="323">So whatever they had they got from us, but this was very poor equipment. </sentence><sentence id="324">They were poorly equipped. </sentence><sentence id="325">Some pistols, some few guns. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was very small, very poorly equipped insurgence army. </sentence><sentence id="327">Q. Was there any coordination in terms of information? </sentence><sentence id="328">A. There were, there were liaison people who were coming from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, mostly by <span class="dlf">sewers</span> or other ways. </sentence><sentence id="329">I don't know what. </sentence><sentence id="330">One of them was <span class="building">Antec Zuckerman</span> (?), </sentence><sentence id="331">for instance. </sentence><sentence id="332">He was the one that was kind of a liaison between the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">There were some others. </sentence><sentence id="334">And there was an organized transport of arms. </sentence><sentence id="335">The men who were really in touch with them was was among others. </sentence><sentence id="336">He was the one who was assigned to be a  3 A. Not much, whatever, only what was published in the underground papers, because the tule was that if you belong to one <span class="interior space">cell</span>, or one <span class="spatial object">unit</span>, you are not allowed to get, involve yourself in any other. </sentence><sentence id="337">This was the rule to protect organization. </sentence><sentence id="338">You, you shouldn't try to know more than you have to know because if you are arrested you never know how you will, you know, will you, if you will not under tortures, if you will not break down and will not betray others. </sentence><sentence id="339">It was assumed that the man who is arrested and tortured may tell the Germans under, you know, tortures, things about others. </sentence><sentence id="340">So the policy was that everybody had to limit, to have his knowledge as limited as possible. </sentence><sentence id="341">End of Tape 1  4 Tape 2 Q. How extensive was the <span class="spatial object">Polish underground</span>? </sentence><sentence id="342">A. It was very extensive because in addition to people who were organized, and I believe people who were organized were probably no more than 400,000. </sentence><sentence id="343">There was a <span class="region">hinterland</span>, the people who were supporting by offering hiding places or any kind of help so that frankly we could operate mainly because of this kind of spontaneous assistance from people who were not themselves organized but who were ready to accept the risks and to help. </sentence><sentence id="344">Q. Had this whole <span class="region">state</span> essentially gone <span class="dlf">underground</span>? </sentence><sentence id="345">I mean, what kind of services were-- A. Well, it was really an underground state. </sentence><sentence id="346">There were <span class="building">court</span>, <span class="building">underground courts</span>, <span class="building">underground justice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">There was, there were <span class="building">underground universities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">There was a whole underground life really, and it comprised the entire <span class="populated place">society</span> really. </sentence><sentence id="349">So Jan Karski (?) </sentence><sentence id="350">called his book published in <span class="country">United States</span> during the war "The Story of the Underground State," and it was the <span class="region">underground state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">Q. Who was getting prosecuted in these <span class="building">courts</span>? </sentence><sentence id="352">A. Oh, the traitors, collaborators with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="353">This was the <span class="building">court</span> to sentence the people who were guilty of collaboration with the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="354">Also the people who, for instance, denouncing Jews were, were also put before this <span class="building">court</span> and executed. </sentence><sentence id="355">But, Gestapo people, particularly cruel Germans and it was also a kind of psychological warfare because the man who was sentenced would first get the sentence and then he would be killed or he would get a warning that he's going to be put before this kind of <span class="interior space">underground court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">But this was a regular <span class="building">court</span> with the attorneys. </sentence><sentence id="357">They were mostly professional judges or professional lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="358">So, there were regular <span class="building">courts</span> and they were using the Polish penal code. </sentence><sentence id="359">Q. In all these spontaneous organizations and prewar political organizations they all came together and supported this unified system? </sentence><sentence id="360">A. Correct. </sentence><sentence id="361">There were some groups that did not belong to it. </sentence><sentence id="362">Extreme right wing groups were, did not belong to the, this underground state and communists. </sentence><sentence id="363">Otherwise there were people of all possible outlooks. </sentence><sentence id="364">There were nationalists, there were social democrats, there were catholics, all kinds of groups--peasants. </sentence><sentence id="365">The whole spector of political views with the exception of extreme rightist and communists. </sentence><sentence id="366">Q. Were they a problem? </sentence><sentence id="367">A. They were a problem, particularly communists but also the extreme right wing were problems. </sentence><sentence id="368">Q. How did you get your supplies and what supplies were especially important to you? </sentence><sentence id="369">A. What? </sentence><sentence id="370">Q. How did you get the supplies the <span class="interior space">underground</span> needed? </sentence><sentence id="371"> 5 A. Well you know, the money and the weapons did come from, from <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">They were parachuted. </sentence><sentence id="373">There were some weapons that were bought from Germans or we simply attacked the German units and took the weapons. </sentence><sentence id="374">But supply of money would come mainly from first <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">From outside. </sentence><sentence id="376">Q. What other supplies were really crucial to your efforts? </sentence><sentence id="377">A. Mostly <span class="spatial object">weapons</span>, but money as well because people had to live from something. </sentence><sentence id="378">If somebody could, lost his legal life, so to speak, he had to live with false documents, he couldn't work, so he had to be put on the payroll. </sentence><sentence id="379">So, money was extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="380">The <span class="building">underground press</span> had to buy papers. </sentence><sentence id="381">Q. So if you had the money you could get any of the other things you needed? </sentence><sentence id="382">A. Yes, including even weapons but one could buy weapons from some German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="383">Weapons and ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="384">Q. What sort of risk did you, did you personally have to take a lot of high risk? </sentence><sentence id="385">A. Oh, yes, I had to risk my life very often. </sentence><sentence id="386">I mean any crossing of the <span class="dlf">border</span> with forged documents and with compromising material was very risky. </sentence><sentence id="387">Moving around in the, <span class="country">Germany</span>, being a Pole, was very risky even considering that I didn't speak good German. </sentence><sentence id="388">Crossing from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span> was not an easy matter. </sentence><sentence id="389">I don't want to advertise myself because people were taking considerable risks. </sentence><sentence id="390">Many people died. </sentence><sentence id="391">Many people were arrested and died. </sentence><sentence id="392">I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="393">Q. How afraid were you at the time? </sentence><sentence id="394">A. I was, I really had probably no imagination. </sentence><sentence id="395">Because as I told you before I was once scared to death when a Jewish girl with very characteristic Jewish features asked me that I, that she should take me under arm to cross the so called <span class="dlf">schpera</span> (?), </sentence><sentence id="396">you know, where Germans were checking. </sentence><sentence id="397">I knew that if they would arrest her I would be executed as well, so I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="398">I was very much afraid before the parachute training. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was a kind of suicide really to jump out of the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="400">It was a, but otherwise I got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="401">I never thought about dangers and risks and I was not very much afraid simply because I was not thinking about what may happen. </sentence><sentence id="402">This was the best thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="403">Q. How much initiative did you have to take versus systems that were in place for you? </sentence><sentence id="404">A. Every day, every step. </sentence><sentence id="405">It all depended on my initiative, on my concepts, my ideas, how to act, what to do, how to avoid dangers, how to find the people who can help. </sentence><sentence id="406">You were left to your own resources mostly. </sentence><sentence id="407">Q. What prepared you for this? </sentence><sentence id="408">A. What? </sentence><sentence id="409">Q. What do you think prepared you for this kind of activity? </sentence><sentence id="410">A. I had the motivation I think. </sentence><sentence id="411">I did want to serve my <span class="country">country</span> and to help to, to defeat the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="412">Q. Tell me a little bit more about the propaganda campaign, its action end. </sentence><sentence id="413">A. Well it was a psychological warfare with the main purpose was to demoralize the Germans by all kinds of tricks. </sentence><sentence id="414">For instance, instruction, "How to behave to avoid, you know,  6 frost at the <span class="region">east front</span>," which was so terrible, the instructions, that would frighten anybody going to the <span class="region">east front</span>, to the, to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">That's just one example. </sentence><sentence id="416">For instance, the Germans in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, yes, would get a secret instructions that the gas attack, chemical weapon attack by Russians is expected in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and that they should go to the such and such <span class="building">office</span> to collect gas masks. </sentence><sentence id="417">You see? </sentence><sentence id="418">But they are not allowed to tell Poles about it because there are not enough gas masks. </sentence><sentence id="419">We knew there were no gas masks at all. </sentence><sentence id="420">So, the Germans would make queues, would come for gas masks and were told we don't have any gas masks for you which would spread panic of course. </sentence><sentence id="421">There were for instance we would send the secret instructions--no, not secret, open instructions that there is such and such anniversary in the Nazi movement and today is free from work. </sentence><sentence id="422">It was not, but if every worker and every engineer in a big <span class="building">factory</span> producing weapons they would not come to work and it would be a terrific waste of manpower, you see. </sentence><sentence id="423">We were forging secret forms of all kind of Nazi documents and, you know, all kinds of managers, directors, important people would get an order. </sentence><sentence id="424">For instance the important engineer in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> would get an order to go the party meeting in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425">So, he would put his SA uniform on him and he would go to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> to say that you are a victim of a joke. </sentence><sentence id="426">Okay but he would not be at work. </sentence><sentence id="427">It would inflict considerable damage to <span class="spatial object">war machinery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">So, it was a kind of a psychological sabotage which was extremely effective. </sentence><sentence id="429">And above all, to give the Germans the impression that there is an anti-Nazi resistance movement which in fact did not exist. </sentence><sentence id="430">That there is <span class="dlf">anti-Hitler plots</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">All this had certain psychological impact on Germans and I think we were pretty effective in this. </sentence><sentence id="432">Q. Were you thinking up a lot of these schemes? </sentence><sentence id="433">A. No. </sentence><sentence id="434">My job really was to organize the network and distribution and the others were thinking about, you know, were finding the ideas how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="435">Q. Did you have any sense of how effective it was? </sentence><sentence id="436">A. We did, because we did have all kinds of secret German documents how to fight it, how to -- and Germans went out of their way to find us, to arrest us and so on. </sentence><sentence id="437">And then we had the report from the British Intelligence Service which found that this was a very effective job. </sentence><sentence id="438">We got a lot of praise from the British for this kind of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="439">They did have their own black propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="440">We were trying -- one of my jobs was to establish cooperation between British black propaganda which was mostly, mostly for, by radio, you know. </sentence><sentence id="441">But radio which were posing as the <span class="spatial object">German underground radios</span> and the man who was conducting it was a genius by the name of Sefton Delmer (?). </sentence><sentence id="442">I met him and he praised our effort very highly. </sentence><sentence id="443">He respected what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="444">Q. What was your biggest challenge in setting up this <span class="dlf">distribution network</span>? </sentence><sentence id="445">A. Well, to travel, travel with the forged documents with the compromising material under, with the uniform of a railway man without good knowledge of German. </sentence><sentence id="446">There was a considerable risk in it but it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="447">It was, I considered it the most fascinating part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="448">Q. Was it easy to recruit people for this? </sentence><sentence id="449"> 7 A. It was easy. </sentence><sentence id="450">Too many people. </sentence><sentence id="451">There were too many volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="452">You had to be selective, but people did want to work for us and were really contemptuous of the, of the risk of life. </sentence><sentence id="453">Q. Now when you were in <span class="populated place">London</span>, you were there doing what? </sentence><sentence id="454">A, Well, I arrived right after the on 11th of December "43 and I left on <span class="dlf">I  8</span> I was in the presence of Ignace Schwartzbart (?) </sentence><sentence id="455">who was a Polish zionist an important political figure. </sentence><sentence id="456">I sensed that they don't believe me and only one high level British intellengence officer was really moved by my story about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="457">And he told me, in the same, I was told the same story by Ignace Schwartzbart (?). </sentence><sentence id="458">Don't tell people that two and half million Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="459">Nobody is going to believe you. </sentence><sentence id="460">It's something beyond imagination. </sentence><sentence id="461">They will say you exaggerate. </sentence><sentence id="462">Tell individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="463">Tell what you saw. </sentence><sentence id="464">Use examples but don't use statistics because you will, they will not believe you. </sentence><sentence id="465">And I was trying to use it, but when I and my wife, after the war in "76, when I was writing my war memoirs, we both went to <span class="populated place">London</span>, to the <span class="building">archives</span>, to Her Majesty's <span class="building">records office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="466">Plenty of documents were already declassified and I found a lot of documents concerning myself. </sentence><sentence id="467">The report that Antony Eden wrote after meeting me addressed to <span class="populated place">Churchill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">In all this reports, nothing about what I said about the Jews, at not one word I spoke to the intelligence officers. </sentence><sentence id="469">I spoke to the, to <span class="populated place">Eden</span>, to others. </sentence><sentence id="470">In all their reporting any reference to the Jews were not repeated. </sentence><sentence id="471">Then I was interested to find if the same story was with Jan Karski (?), </sentence><sentence id="472">who was one year before me. </sentence><sentence id="473">And I found a report of Antony Eden on his conversation with Karski in the documents of the British war cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="474">It was printed and distributed. </sentence><sentence id="475">Not one word about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="476">So, I sent it to <span class="populated place">Karski</span> and he wrote me back, saying, "Look, I mean, I told <span class="populated place">Eden</span>, when I was describing the situation in <span class="country">Poland</span>, I told about what's going on with the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="477">Not one word. </sentence><sentence id="478">Not one word, and the main reason I think, you know, you had to differentiate between two categories of people. </sentence><sentence id="479">There are people who simply didn't believe because this was something beyond their imagination. </sentence><sentence id="480">And there were Jews, Jews from <span class="country">United States</span> I talked to and British Jews who simply didn't believe. </sentence><sentence id="481">They didn't believe that there is a possibility of mass killing in a sort of conveyor belt method, you know, like in a <span class="building">factory</span>, or in a <span class="building">butchery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="482">You just mechanically kill people one after the other. </sentence><sentence id="483">They didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="484">And they, they were suspecting me of some kind of ulterior motive. </sentence><sentence id="485">They said, "Why a Pole should exaggerate?Well, because he's anti-German and he would like to have as harsh terms imposed on the Germans after that defeat as possible. </sentence><sentence id="486">That's why he's exaggerating." </sentence><sentence id="487">And they were, but, as far as such people as <span class="populated place">Eden</span> is concerned or members of the <span class="building">cabinet</span>, they were very well informed because after, discovered it after the war, that for instance, a very high level Nazi official, whose name is known, was passing to a Polish intelligence officer in <span class="populated place">Berne</span>, in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, information about the plans of final solution well before it was they started to implement it. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I know that this report was passed on to British and to Americans. </sentence><sentence id="489">They knew but they didn't -- they were afraid that if this would become known publicly it would generate the pressure from the Jewish communities and general public for some kind of action that would divert limited military resources from the military <span class="spatial object">targets</span> to the <span class="spatial object">targets</span> that are in their view irrelevant from the military point of view, and that may prolong the war. </sentence><sentence id="490">I don't remember if it was <span class="populated place">Eden</span> or <span class="populated place">Beven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491"><span class="building">Bevine</span> (?), </sentence><sentence id="492">rather, Annis Bevine who said, "Well the only way we can really save the Jews is to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="493">And the more we can focus on military targets, strategic military, the better to the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="494">I think they refused to bomb the <span class="dlf">railway track</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> because they believed that they would be repaired in a matter of days or hours, but the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>  9 may be lost. </sentence><sentence id="495">The <span class="spatial object">planes</span> which could be used to bomb the important target in <span class="country">Germany</span> would be diverted from the target. </sentence><sentence id="496">And they were wrong because the greatest tragedy of Jews was not just their deaths. </sentence><sentence id="497">Indifference of the world. </sentence><sentence id="498">That absolut--They were absolutely lonely in the face of their death. </sentence><sentence id="499">It was in the, they realized the world doesn't care about them. </sentence><sentence id="500">That's what killed them, about the dimension of the crime, we are lonely, you see, and this was, in my view, it was a crime, really, not to do something. </sentence><sentence id="501">The kind of a moral relief that we tried to do something to save you, you know. </sentence><sentence id="502">Q. What was your impression of <span class="populated place">Eden</span> and <span class="populated place">Churchill</span>? </sentence><sentence id="503">A. Well, Churchill was not very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="504">It was, really, I had only ten minutes and I was so intimidated by his appearance and some kind of, you know, impression. " </sentence><sentence id="505">Well why really this young man is taking my time?" </sentence><sentence id="506">This kind of thing, that I lost my self, I was not good, my performance was not good because I was so nervous that I didn't perform well with Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="507">But with <span class="populated place">Eden</span> I was pretty lucid and, as I say, he was very, very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="508">When I showed him the photographs of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> with the, some underground inscriptions of the war on the <span class="dlf">walls</span> and all that, he said to himself, "Poor <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>," and all that, but there was the attitude well, we cannot do anything for you. </sentence><sentence id="509">I mean, you have to accommodate yourself with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="510">You know, we cannot save you. </sentence><sentence id="511">We cannot save <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">You have to make your war effort to contribute and to try to find some kind of compromise with Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="513">That was the message basically. </sentence><sentence id="514">Q. Discouraging? </sentence><sentence id="515">A. Discouraging! </sentence><sentence id="516">It was the worst time of my entire life. </sentence><sentence id="517">Appeasement, total appeasement. </sentence><sentence id="518">Q. When you returned to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, was right before the uprising, the Polish uprising, what were you doing during the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="519">A. I was in charge of the <span class="building">insurgent radio station</span> called , Lightening, which  0 A. No, we had, we had some parachute, you know, some weapons and ammunition and food parachuted. </sentence><sentence id="520">It was not enough but even without this kind of help the uprising would not last 63 days. </sentence><sentence id="521">Then we had one at the very end when the uprising was in it's agony on the 18th of September there was a mass daylight raid by American so called <span class="building">fortresses</span> so that the <span class="env feature">sky</span> was covered by <span class="spatial object">American planes</span> and they dropped thousands of parachutes with weapons, ammunition and food. </sentence><sentence id="522">But this were the last days of the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="523">We were holding the very small parts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> so most of it went into the Germans hands because they couldn't hit the small <span class="region">areas</span> we were still holding. </sentence><sentence id="524">Q. Was there Russian support during the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="525">A. Only appearances of it. </sentence><sentence id="526">No, they wanted us. </sentence><sentence id="527">They wanted Germans to finish us. </sentence><sentence id="528">They, I could see them with my eyes, I mean, on the other side of the <span class="env feature">river</span>, <span class="populated place">cities</span> separated by, you know, the, divided by the <span class="env feature">River Vistula</span>. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were on the other side waiting until Hitler finished us. </sentence><sentence id="530">Q. Was <span class="populated place">London</span> supportive of what you were doing at this point? </sentence><sentence id="531">A. Who? </sentence><sentence id="532">Q. Your <span class="populated place">London</span> government? </sentence><sentence id="533">A. Of course, I mean, they, they were supporting, but they were helpless, I mean it was a government in exile. </sentence><sentence id="534">All they could do was to beg British to, and Americans, to give us, send us ammunition, weapons, food, medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="535">Q. How organized was the uprising? </sentence><sentence id="536">A. It was well organized. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was, otherwise we would not hold for 63 days. </sentence><sentence id="538">Again, it was a kind of, of liberated <span class="populated place">city</span>, really, with its own life but communication was very well organized. </sentence><sentence id="539">They were, for instance, we were using <span class="dlf">sewers</span> because the areas of the <span class="populated place">city</span> were isolated and communication between the <span class="region">areas</span> we were holding were mostly through the <span class="dlf">sewers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="540">Q. What kind of messages were you sending to <span class="populated place">London</span>? </sentence><sentence id="541">A. Well, information about the fighting, about our needs. </sentence><sentence id="542">This was our daily reports of what's, what was going on in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">Q. Were you in your <span class="building">radio tower</span> when the under, under whatever it is, started? </sentence><sentence id="544">A. No, the <span class="building">studio</span> was, was on the very, either in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, in the <span class="interior space">cellars</span> or on the first <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="545">We moved from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="546">We couldn't be in the same place all the time. </sentence><sentence id="547">The normal <span class="spatial object">transmitter</span> was outside. </sentence><sentence id="548">Q. But you weren't really in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> when all of this activity--- A. Well, we had to move through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="549">Q. What was happening? </sentence><sentence id="550">A. We were under the bombs, under, under fire all the time. </sentence><sentence id="551">We had a kind of <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> or we were... To avoid the <span class="dlf">streets</span> which were under fire, there were <span class="dlf">corridors</span>, I mean the <span class="dlf">walls</span> were, you know, so that you travel from <span class="interior space">cellars</span> to <span class="interior space">cellars</span> under the <span class="building">houses</span> to avoid the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">It's the whole <span class="interior space">underground labrynth</span> of, of, of communication. </sentence><sentence id="553">Q. Did everything happen in a synchronized fashion? </sentence><sentence id="554">Did all of a sudden one day at an appointed hour the <span class="populated place">city</span> --  1 A. Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="555">This was 5 p.m. August 1. </sentence><sentence id="556">There was so called zero hour when it started. </sentence><sentence id="557">We have 13 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="558">I don't think I really told you all about the Jewish aspect because you are mainly interested in non-Jewish aspects, but this is the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">Q. Well, what else... A. Well, what kinds of--it depends on you, what questions. </sentence><sentence id="560">Q. Ihave asked you a number of questions and I think you have talked about your relationship with Jewish people, your mission to go tell <span class="populated place">London</span> about what was happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="561">If there are <span class="region">areas</span> that you feel I haven't asked you about, because I, maybe I don't even know, to please-- A. Only my personal experiences which I describe in my book for instance when I was going to, to -- it was the time of the agony of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> when really I mean people were starving. </sentence><sentence id="562">And although it meant a sentence of death for any Jew to go outside of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because he would he would killed on the spot by any German patron. </sentence><sentence id="563">People were made so desperate by starvation that they would take any risk to go outside through their own means and ways to beg for food or for money, buy food and I, this is, this is something that I will never forget in my life. </sentence><sentence id="564">When I was going to a <span class="building">town hall</span> and to do some business there and this was probably the spring of "43 or maybe earlier. </sentence><sentence id="565">Earlier. </sentence><sentence id="566">And I saw a young Jew who was sitting on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span> with his back on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and his head was just on, like this, you know, and there was a cap on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span> full of money. </sentence><sentence id="567">People were dropping, you know, some notes and some money. </sentence><sentence id="568">He was just sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="569">So I came to him and said to him, "Look, I mean, if you will sit here, the first German patron will kill you. </sentence><sentence id="570">Take your money, buy your bread and disappear." </sentence><sentence id="571">And I remember he just raised his head and very, looked at me very intensely and he was really a living skeleton but had beautiful black eyes. </sentence><sentence id="572">The boy was no more than 16 maybe 17 and I saw that he wants to tell me something. </sentence><sentence id="573">He couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="574">So I said to him, "Look, I mean, I have to leave but I'll be back. </sentence><sentence id="575">Go to this <span class="building">church</span>." </sentence><sentence id="576">There was a <span class="building">church</span> nearby. " </sentence><sentence id="577">Go inside and wait for me I'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="578">And I left him. </sentence><sentence id="579">Twenty minutes later I left the <span class="building">office</span> where I had some business and I saw a small crowd around this place, so I came there and the boy was still there with his head like this, you know, sitting in the same position but he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="580">He had no force, you know, to really stood, go, buy something and escape. </sentence><sentence id="581">He didn't want to tell me probably, "I wish I could follow your advice but [have no strength to go." </sentence><sentence id="582">So, I will remember it always this intense looking and this black eyes, you know, of the young fellow who just wanted to tell me something and he couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="583">And also, I remember and I described it, when I went to a <span class="building">court</span> and this was some problem. </sentence><sentence id="584">In my civil life I was manager of a <span class="building">house</span> and collector of rent, and I had some question I had to go to <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="585">Now, the <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="building">courts</span>, some <span class="dlf">windows</span> were to the <span class="region">Aryan side</span>, to the <span class="region">Christian side</span>, the other to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">And this was probably the beginning of "43 when there were only 70,000 Jews left in the <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="587"> 2 On that day the Germans started to get into <span class="spatial object">transports</span> to the <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">And I was in the <span class="interior space">court room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">There was some trivial case of, against somebody who was probably was, you know, was, stole a sack with wheat or something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="590">Trivial. </sentence><sentence id="591">No problem. </sentence><sentence id="592">Outside on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, there was this terrible drama of Jews who were herded that and they were running towards this, you know, place where they were boarded on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="593">There were children. </sentence><sentence id="594">There were women. </sentence><sentence id="595">There were men. </sentence><sentence id="596">I remember the, the, somebody was pushing a <span class="spatial object">cart</span> with the sick Jews who were, you know, limping, they were, you know, almost dying people and these Germans were drunk with their, you know, whips beating these people and pushing them, "schnell, schnell, schnell, quicker, quicker, quicker," and all that. </sentence><sentence id="597">There was some lady who was well dressed and she was holding money in her hands and had a child, a small child and she probably wanted to bribe her way out. </sentence><sentence id="598">So she stretched this money towards the gestapo man and he just beat her with his whip so that she lost balance and the child was dropped on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">And there was an old Jewish woman who was so desperate that she stretched her hands toward the <span class="env feature">sky</span> and said, "Hitler that the <span class="env feature">grass</span> should" -- how did she say this -- "that the <span class="env feature">grass</span> should cover your <span class="building">house</span>," or something of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="600">I was told later this was kind of an old Jewish saying and I didn't want to see what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="601">I knew that she would be shot or killed in some way so I turned from the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="602">There was a silence in the <span class="interior space">court room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">The judge was speechless. </sentence><sentence id="604">He was just, couldn't concentrate because of these terrible shouts from outside and all that. </sentence><sentence id="605">I remember that years later I was stationed in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> as director of the Polish service of radio free Europe and my wife and I went to <span class="populated place">Berchtesgaden</span> and looked at the <span class="building">house</span> of Hitler which was blown up by Americans and believe it or not there was in these ruins there was <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, you know, and <span class="env feature">grass</span> was everywhere between the, this, you know, how you call it, bricks and everywhere was <span class="env feature">grass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="606">So this terrible shout of <span class="env feature">grass</span> cover your <span class="building">house</span> became true. </sentence><sentence id="607">Q. Anything else you want to say? </sentence><sentence id="608">A. Well, that's more or less all, more or less all. </sentence><sentence id="609">It was an unspeakable misery of human beings, and I didn't care whether they were Poles, Jews or Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="610">It was unspeakable tragedy and no words can really convey. </sentence><sentence id="611">The people who were condemned to death only for one crime, they were alive, and total destruction of people of their race, their religion, their heritage, and above all this process of wives who were losing first their husband then their children and in the end they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="612">This was unspeakable tragedy with no precedent. </sentence><sentence id="613">I mean Poles suffered. </sentence><sentence id="614">There were martyrs. </sentence><sentence id="615">I mean, there was not one single Polish family without some victims, but a Pole had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="616">Jews had no hope, no chance. </sentence><sentence id="617">I mean it was a miracle if you would survive. </sentence><sentence id="618">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="619">Q. Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="620">A. That's all. </sentence><sentence id="621">End of Interview. </sentence><sentence id="622"> </sentence></p></dialogue>
