<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: What year were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Did you work in the <span class="building">winery</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: No, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="26">We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the <span class="building">winery</span>, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="27">The only time I went to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> or to the <span class="building">winery</span> is to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers. </sentence><sentence id="28">They were there, of course, I recall we had a <span class="building">winery</span> that took <span class="interior space">space</span> a whole <span class="dlf">block</span> because that whole <span class="dlf">block</span> used to belong to us. </sentence><sentence id="29">Underneath in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> under the whole <span class="dlf">block</span> was the whole <span class="building">winery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">I recall that <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> stacked high. </sentence><sentence id="31">They were smaller. </sentence><sentence id="32">They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the <span class="country">United States</span> but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons. </sentence><sentence id="33">This was the standard <span class="spatial object">barrel</span> at that time to age honey wine. </sentence><sentence id="34">I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there. </sentence><sentence id="35">But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business. </sentence><sentence id="36">It could have been that my uncles had took it over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: You lost your father when you were four years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Do you remember him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Very little. </sentence><sentence id="56">There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="57">He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and each <span class="interior space">room</span> was designated for a certain purpose. </sentence><sentence id="58">Beside the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> we had what we used to call <span class="interior space">salon</span> which is a large <span class="region">area</span> and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our friends of the family. </sentence><sentence id="59">So, we had a fairly large <span class="spatial object">flag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">My grandfather who actually brought </sentence></p><p><sentence id="61"> The following transcript is the result of a recorded

when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="69">That was my family, the immediate family. </sentence><sentence id="70">Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="71">My grandfather brought me up. </sentence><sentence id="72">He was in a way a philosopher on his own. </sentence><sentence id="73">He was a self taught mathematician. </sentence><sentence id="74">He was a true philosopher. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="75">Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. </sentence><sentence id="76">He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. </sentence><sentence id="78">Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more. </sentence><sentence id="79">So, he did traditional things with him. </sentence><sentence id="80">He would get up and go to our <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">We used to call it a . </sentence><sentence id="82">He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come <span class="building">home</span> and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">My grandfather, he was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="84">He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="85">He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="86">But his special language was Hebrew and German. </sentence><sentence id="87">By profession he was a <span class="spatial object">printer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">He came from which is south of <span class="populated place">Louve</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from <span class="country">Romania</span>, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close. </sentence><sentence id="92">We were one family. </sentence><sentence id="93">We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. </sentence><sentence id="94">The other <span class="building">brewery</span> in that was right across our <span class="dlf">street</span> so we had a major <span class="dlf">industrial park</span> if you will of <span class="building">breweries</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="95">It was the <span class="building">Isaac Brewery</span> and there was the <span class="building">Brewery</span> and then there was a <span class="building">Brewery</span> and we were all together in it. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was good. </sentence><sentence id="97">I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different <span class="building">stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and horses and we would be delivering wine so often. </sentence><sentence id="99">I used to like to go to the <span class="building">barn</span> and every so often just to be together with the horses. </sentence><sentence id="100">So, the whole where we used to live, we used to live on which is a normal whole <span class="dlf">block</span> that compares with any <span class="dlf">block</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span>, it was all one <span class="building">brewery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">We were sort of like a <span class="building">corner house</span> which was a three story <span class="building">corner house</span> that borders on and " That was the main <span class="dlf">road</span> in the <span class="dlf">Louve</span> that carried on for a number of miles. </sentence><sentence id="102">The is sort of almost like a <span class="populated place">district</span>, an <span class="region">area</span> where Jews used to live. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was a dominant <span class="region">area</span> for Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="104">It had many <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there. </sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in . </sentence><sentence id="107">The minority in that <span class="region">area</span> were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. </sentence><sentence id="108">There were more Ukrainians in our <span class="region">area</span> than there were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="109">This is not to say that this was typical for -In our <span class="region">area</span> it was typical. </sentence><sentence id="110">The main activity in was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. </sentence><sentence id="111">We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. </sentence><sentence id="112">The potatoes for winter time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="113">The cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="114"> purchasing wine. </sentence><sentence id="115">It wasn't a trade off. </sentence><sentence id="116">It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time. </sentence><sentence id="117">My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special <span class="building">store</span> where it would specialize in Jewish food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">It was a vibrant <span class="region">area</span> for Jews to live. </sentence><sentence id="119">It was very interesting and when the <span class="building">market</span> the <span class="building">farmer's market</span> was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted. </sentence><sentence id="120">The whole <span class="region">area</span> was quiet because Friday night we would be going to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, so the <span class="region">area</span> was depleted. </sentence><sentence id="121">Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. </sentence><sentence id="122">So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter. </sentence><sentence id="123">Although the Jewish life continued. </sentence><sentence id="124">When the life in those days and I'm saying "38 and "39 was quite active it was also troublesome. </sentence><sentence id="125">Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems. </sentence><sentence id="126">Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="127">The rumors were obviously of what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> and what happened in some other <span class="country">countries</span> like in <span class="country">Romania</span> or <span class="country">Russia</span> although we knew very little of <span class="country">Russia</span> but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically. </sentence><sentence id="128">There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="129">There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in <span class="populated place">Louve</span> and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. </sentence><sentence id="130">We didn't know whether we had to take any action. </sentence><sentence id="131">In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. </sentence><sentence id="132">In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="133">I don't remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the was bombarded. </sentence><sentence id="134">All the <span class="building">houses</span>, one bomb hit our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">We were then in our <span class="interior space">basement</span>, actually in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> was where the <span class="building">winery</span> was, but we no longer had the <span class="building">winery</span> but we had the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">A bomb hit just a part of our <span class="building">house</span>, just a part of it, but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our <span class="building">houses</span> in general, but the <span class="dlf">staircase</span>, for example, which were <span class="dlf">concrete staircases</span>, were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already. </sentence><sentence id="137">When we were in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> we had some other friends and some people were in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. </sentence><sentence id="138">We didn't see any fire. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="139">Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other <span class="building">buildings</span> that were attached to our <span class="building">house</span> and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="140">So, that I recall that we were hit by a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided into two major <span class="region">areas</span> with the lights somewhere west of <span class="populated place">Louve</span> and the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="142">This was a new era that we began. </sentence><sentence id="143">The Russians occupied the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of and was part of that <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">I recall when the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> were rolling down from coming from and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">If they were they were somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="146">So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. </sentence><sentence id="147">They kept on moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="148"> new regime and so on. </sentence><sentence id="149">This was the <span class="region">Soviet territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">So that means that our <span class="building">house</span> no longer belonged to us. </sentence><sentence id="151">And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, that was a relief in a way. </sentence><sentence id="153">The big question was how do you make a living. </sentence><sentence id="154">My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things. </sentence><sentence id="155">Eli was basically two years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="156">He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches. </sentence><sentence id="157">He didn't feel like going to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">He never cared for that. </sentence><sentence id="159">My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="160">They would put them in <span class="building">prison</span> which was on -- I recall that <span class="building">prison</span> being called . </sentence><sentence id="161">Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli. </sentence><sentence id="163">I continued to study. </sentence><sentence id="164">I continued to go to <span class="building">school</span>, the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> until that time. </sentence><sentence id="165">The subjects my studies were now basically new. </sentence><sentence id="166">First of all since Jewish -- this was a <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. </sentence><sentence id="167">That was a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="168">In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. </sentence><sentence id="169">My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170">She used to, back in "39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was better in English than I was in French. </sentence><sentence id="172">That's how I picked up some of my English language. </sentence><sentence id="173">But in the <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="174">You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. </sentence><sentence id="175">In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages. </sentence><sentence id="176">The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided into two <span class="region">areas</span>, the <span class="region">German area</span> which is the <span class="dlf">line</span>, quite a few refugees were coming more so from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> to our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">Of course the Germans occupied the <span class="region">western Poland</span> so they were directly under the German authority. </sentence><sentence id="178">And Jews were fleeing from that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">I recall that in my <span class="building">class</span> in we received at least three German students one was from , one was from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, two were from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and one from . </sentence><sentence id="180">And there was another fellow who was also a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family escaped <span class="country">Germany</span> to <span class="country">Poland</span> so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were boys. </sentence><sentence id="183">They were my age. </sentence><sentence id="184">They were more interested in soccer games. </sentence><sentence id="185">They were more interested in learning the language, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the Germans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. </sentence><sentence id="186">We were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="187">We knew the Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="188">We knew the laws. </sentence><sentence id="189">They were not that much involved. </sentence><sentence id="190">They didn't care about that. </sentence><sentence id="191">Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="192">We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. </sentence><sentence id="193">They had their way of life. </sentence><sentence id="194">So, they did not mention anything of their event. </sentence><sentence id="195">The refugees who were coming in more and more from the <span class="region">western part</span>, from <span class="country">Poland</span>, we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> was just bad. </sentence><sentence id="196">They were claiming that the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> are being established. </sentence><sentence id="197">they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. </sentence><sentence id="198">We thought in because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, but these were true persecutions they were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="199">We didn't understand what a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> means. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="201">It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="202">We didn't know what people would do in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> let alone the <span class="building">establishment</span> and how do you so things people ignored that part. </sentence><sentence id="203">But as they were coming, more by thousands, the <span class="building">shed</span> that we used to have at <span class="building">home</span>, we have opened up, the <span class="interior space">salon</span> and the special <span class="interior space">section room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there. </sentence><sentence id="205">We had a large <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and we offered them everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="206">They stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="207">Some of them took to work. </sentence><sentence id="208">Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back <span class="building">home</span> wherever their <span class="building">home</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="209">There was quite a few from , from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> from -- I don't recall the small <span class="populated place">towns</span> in the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, we had a big <span class="building">house</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="211">It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. </sentence><sentence id="212">That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">I run into that, and they put them in <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> and a <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span>, <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and they were locked up over there. </sentence><sentence id="215">That's how they were going to transport them from to <span class="region">east</span> to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">We couldn't do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="217">I knew they were crying, really crying. </sentence><sentence id="218">What did they do wrong? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="220">They didn't kill them, but they put them away. </sentence><sentence id="221">We found out later that they were sent to and to different parts of <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">I never met them again. </sentence><sentence id="223">Life in continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded . </sentence><sentence id="224">Can we stop for a second?

no <span class="spatial object">Fessel</span> in this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="465">I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his workers is here.

me. </sentence><sentence id="478">And probably I was stupid and she took me back and walked me right into this <span class="interior space">room</span> in this <span class="building">house</span> where Fessel was. </sentence><sentence id="479">Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name, how I got the address because if I could find them someone else

</sentence><sentence id="494">His brother was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. </sentence><sentence id="495">He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. </sentence><sentence id="496">It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different <span class="dlf">route</span>, but the <span class="dlf">route</span> that I know how Fessel got into this <span class="building">house</span> was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in . </sentence><sentence id="497">So at least two people from our <span class="building">factory</span>, his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend. </sentence><sentence id="498">That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there. </sentence><sentence id="499">Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. </sentence><sentence id="500">So we had like seven people there. </sentence><sentence id="501">I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. </sentence><sentence id="502">It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. </sentence><sentence id="503">The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place <span class="building">home</span> and tell him no one was there. </sentence><sentence id="504">So, I could go and apparently go back <span class="building">home</span> to their place to secure their hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="505">It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his place. </sentence><sentence id="506">They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs. </sentence><sentence id="507">They left it at that. </sentence><sentence id="508">So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe place for the time being. </sentence><sentence id="509">The <span class="region">area</span> we were in one <span class="interior space">room</span> I think maybe it was another <span class="interior space">room</span>, but basically I was in the front in the large <span class="interior space">room</span> that was together with this hiding family. </sentence><sentence id="510">We had a <span class="dlf">trap door</span> to the <span class="interior space">basement</span> which was not in the walking place but in a <span class="interior space">crawling space</span>. </sentence><sentence id="511">We had a special <span class="region">area</span> that was covered with a <span class="env feature">rock</span> in case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. </sentence><sentence id="512">We had our food. </sentence><sentence id="513">Apparently <span class="building">Fessel</span> had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria. </sentence><sentence id="514">I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. </sentence><sentence id="515">I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either. </sentence><sentence id="516">So, I thought things were taken care of by <span class="building">Fessel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">The other couple they also were from <span class="populated place">Louve</span>, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers. </sentence><sentence id="518">Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive. </sentence><sentence id="519">There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="520">So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. </sentence><sentence id="521">I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. </sentence><sentence id="522">There was a point in time the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> is being liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="523">The rumors were also that the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 weren't even talking about <span class="country">Hungary</span> at that time at all. </sentence><sentence id="524">The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them. </sentence><sentence id="525">I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them. </sentence><sentence id="526">I could always stay here, but I want to get out of <span class="populated place">Louve</span> in general. </sentence><sentence id="527">This is a horrible place. </sentence><sentence id="528">I don't want to be here, even in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="529">He said well, we'll have to see what our resources are. </sentence><sentence id="530">We'll have to see if we can give you some papers. </sentence><sentence id="531">He apparently was good enough to do that for me. </sentence><sentence id="532">I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to <span class="country">Hungary</span> from <span class="populated place">Louve</span> to from to <span class="env feature">Mountains</span>, through <span class="country">Slovakia</span> to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">That's the plan. </sentence><sentence id="534">I walked with them all the way. </sentence><sentence id="535">I'll go with you anyplace you go. </sentence><sentence id="536">I felt that I could be of help to them if they needed me. </sentence><sentence id="537">The time came sometime in the early part of December I think,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="730">I never asked her. </sentence><sentence id="731">The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="732">The fact that I saw her one day in a <span class="building">factory</span> walking towards the <span class="building">office</span> that means she was prearranged. </sentence><sentence id="733">She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. </sentence><sentence id="734">I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening. </sentence><sentence id="735">He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money. </sentence><sentence id="736">He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game. </sentence><sentence id="737">Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth. </sentence><sentence id="738">She had this <span class="building">house</span> and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion. </sentence><sentence id="739">Maybe it was a combination of both. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: Was this a very lonely time for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. </sentence><sentence id="754">I was very active. </sentence><sentence id="755">My mind was always going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. </sentence><sentence id="756">My question was to myself how do you get out of this place. </sentence><sentence id="757">I was fierce about it. </sentence><sentence id="758">I was driven by that. </sentence><sentence id="759">How do you get out and stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="760">Because I felt that I had to say something later on. </sentence><sentence id="761">Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part. </sentence><sentence id="762">So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. </sentence><sentence id="763">I was too dynamic to be lonely. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="764">So, when they saw me coming back from that <span class="building">train station</span> and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had. </sentence><sentence id="765">I don't think I had anything with me. </sentence><sentence id="766">I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="767">We went through the main <span class="building">station</span>, got our ticket. </sentence><sentence id="768">There was a direct <span class="spatial object">train</span> to . </sentence><sentence id="769">It was all night. </sentence><sentence id="770">We went through over night and the following day we were already in . </sentence><sentence id="771">We were picked up by  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 the <span class="dlf">verge</span> between December and January. </sentence><sentence id="772">It was very cold and we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> from to a small <span class="populated place">village</span> close to <span class="env feature">Tatra Mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="773">It was basically a <span class="building">ski resort</span> and we departed from there. </sentence><sentence id="774">We picked up and we kept on walking. </sentence><sentence id="775">It was an <span class="region">area</span> probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. </sentence><sentence id="776">By the way, this <span class="region">area</span> was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and <span class="building">border police</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="777">The smugglers were actually Polish. </sentence><sentence id="778">I forget their name. </sentence><sentence id="779">I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the <span class="env feature">Tatra mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="780">The episode that I recall was walking in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="781">It was so called and also the snow was very deep. </sentence><sentence id="782">The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a <span class="dlf">trap</span> because you couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="783">It was a very difficult walk. </sentence><sentence id="784">Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking. </sentence><sentence id="785">At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had boots. </sentence><sentence id="786">So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="787">No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="788">The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem. </sentence><sentence id="789">He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode. </sentence><sentence id="790">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="791">I felt good. </sentence><sentence id="792">I was strong and I tried to help her. </sentence><sentence id="793">I did help her. </sentence><sentence id="794">I kept on walking with her. </sentence><sentence id="795">At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="796">At one point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip. </sentence><sentence id="797">I couldn't leave her. </sentence><sentence id="798">I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. </sentence><sentence id="799">Such a shame, but we survived. </sentence><sentence id="800">We went through the <span class="env feature">Tatra mountains</span> and got into <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="801">At least we were there. </sentence><sentence id="802">We were so called safe and the <span class="building">boarder police</span> grabbed us. </sentence><sentence id="803">They took us into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from <span class="country">Poland</span>, so we were all Polish. </sentence><sentence id="804">So, from this <span class="region">police area</span> I think they took us into a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="805">We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. </sentence><sentence id="806">I don't recall how long we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="807">There was another couple from <span class="country">Poland</span>, independently they came in. </sentence><sentence id="808">They were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="809">One was a professor | think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people. </sentence><sentence id="810">At that point they took a picture of us that [had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time later. </sentence><sentence id="811">The object has to move from <span class="country">Slovakia</span> now to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and within a few days I think we were moved from <span class="country">Slovakia</span> to another <span class="populated place">border town</span> which I have a hard time remembering. </sentence><sentence id="812">It was comes to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="813">Maybe I'm wrong but was the <span

the early part in January. </sentence><sentence id="816">If I recall well, when I was already in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, <span class="country">Hungary</span> was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later part of January but not the early part. </sentence><sentence id="817">We were brought in and and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further

recall. </sentence><sentence id="820">It was immaterial to me. </sentence><sentence id="821">What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a Polish refugee and to be on their books. </sentence><sentence id="822">From there on it was just a matter of finding out your level of survival. </sentence><sentence id="823">Where do you go from there. </sentence><sentence id="824">The trigger point was the time when the Germans again invaded <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="825">That was the trigger point, be on the run. </sentence><sentence id="826">You had to run again, and where to you run. </sentence><sentence id="827">By that time I had already met some people, not friends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes. </sentence><sentence id="828">The same problem, where do you run. </sentence><sentence id="829">One thought was to run to get into <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">The way you could get to <span class="country">Turkey</span> was through <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="831">The other thought was to run to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, means you had to go through <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="832">Which <span class="dlf">route</span> do you explore. </sentence><sentence id="833">You explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. </sentence><sentence id="834">I felt to be in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="835">That was bad. </sentence><sentence id="836">A better way is to go through <span class="country">Turkey</span> through <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="837">I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them. </sentence><sentence id="838">Some of these people were mostly Jews. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="839">Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="840">I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the <span class="building">Polish underground</span> which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. </sentence><sentence id="841">Even that group, I have some Polish members. </sentence><sentence id="842">I was in a <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="843">Seven people, we had seven people in our <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="844">I wasn't given orders to carry out. </sentence><sentence id="845">Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to place, mainly from <span class="populated place">Buddha</span> to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to <span class="populated place">Buddha</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="846">At one time I had to go outside <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, but this was a short trip and I came back. </sentence><sentence id="847">One time I had to carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about it. </sentence><sentence id="848">I'm doing something about it. </sentence><sentence id="849">Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers, false birth

mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="851">Not specifically for Polish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="852">We were all saved so called. </sentence><sentence id="853">The question now is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="854">They needed the papers. </sentence><sentence id="855">They did not have the flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside. </sentence><sentence id="856">There was a time that they were mostly almost confined to the <span class="populated place">house

were free. </sentence><sentence id="860">I happened to get myself with the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and they advised me to have two or three residents in <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="906">They wanted to know again, what was the message that I was trying to deliver to <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="907">Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being Jewish wasn't their concern apparently. </sentence><sentence id="908">I don't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="909">Whether they took it for granted one way or the other,

it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="916">One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="917">When they were brought back, they took out the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> to watch the hanging. </sentence><sentence id="918">That was sometime probably in December. </sentence><sentence id="919">It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the morning when

</sentence><sentence id="928">So, the recreation of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was almost eminent. </sentence><sentence id="929">January 5, comes to my mind but I'll stand corrected if it was something else. </sentence><sentence id="930">We were evacuated from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we walked a long time to another <span

</sentence><sentence id="934">They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="935">I always felt that I could survive. </sentence><sentence id="936">There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the way I used
