<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Can you tell us your name and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. </sentence><sentence id="3">Loew was L-O- W, but when I came to the <span class="country">United States</span> it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name actually here in the <span class="country">United States</span> is William Loew, but my friends back at <span class="building">home</span> they remember me as Wilek. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Lwow</span>, <span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5"><span class="populated place">Lemberg</span> is basically a German name for Louve and my parents came from probably <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">I'm not quite sure, but from <span class="country">Austria</span> and we settled down in <span class="populated place">Lwow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">That was <span class="region">Galicia</span> at the time and also known as a <span class="country">Austria</span> Hungarian empire. </sentence><sentence id="8">The time in the when I was born I had basically a nice family, a wonderful family. </sentence><sentence id="9">Let me speak about my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="10">I had an older brother we used to call Eli. </sentence><sentence id="11">The oldest one was Abe. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had a very close family. </sentence><sentence id="13">My mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business. </sentence><sentence id="14">Our business was we had a <span class="building">brewery</span> a <span class="building">mead brewery</span> which is a honey wine. </sentence><sentence id="15">The <span class="building">business</span> was quite prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="16">For one thing, our <span class="building">business</span> has been derived from previous generations. </sentence><sentence id="17">We started, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870. </sentence><sentence id="18">As a matter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine. </sentence><sentence id="19">Our family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers from either side, my mother's and my father's side. </sentence><sentence id="20">We were more numerous on my father's side than on my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="21">My mother's maiden name was Margulies and some of her brothers went to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder stayed there in at that time. </sentence><sentence id="23">We stayed and we tried to continue our business. </sentence><sentence id="24">My father died when I was four years old. </sentence><sentence id="25">He died probably 1929 so my mother actually took over the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">I don't think she was a good business woman from what I recall. </sentence><sentence id="27">The business continued. </sentence><sentence id="28">We had my oldest brother could not get into a <span class="building">university</span> in because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move out from <span class="populated place">Louve</span> to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">So, he studied there. </sentence><sentence id="30">This was expensive to study in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> because the money that we had from the <span class="building">business</span> was not that prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="31">I'm not quite sure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the <span class="building">business</span> as she should be. </sentence><sentence id="32">So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and we were no longer in the business of honey wine. </sentence><sentence id="33">But my uncles they continued to be in business. </sentence><sentence id="34">At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas of <span class="country">Poland</span> that we know and also to other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">The Jewish life in <span class="populated place">Louve</span> was the best that can be said back in "37 "38 from what I can recall was lukewarm. </sentence><sentence id="36">It wasn't very bad. </sentence><sentence id="37">It wasn't very good. </sentence><sentence id="38">We did have our quotas going to <span class="building">school</span> as a matter of fact when I went for my exam to enter the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> even though the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> was ten blocks away from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota. </sentence><sentence id="39">I passed I understand my entry exam, but I couldn't get in. </sentence><sentence id="40">That was back in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="41">So, in order to continue my studies I had to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another <span class="building">gymnasium</span> back on Louve on <span class="dlf">Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">It was known as the <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">Going back to "38, "38 was a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet the loans that my father apparently incurred. </sentence><sentence id="44">So, things were difficult. </sentence><sentence id="45">My oldest brother Abe who was in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, he finished his master's degree and he came back <span class="building">home</span> and he The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="46">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="47">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="48">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="49">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="50">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="51"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection tried to stabilize, because he was basically the oldest in our family, he tried to stabilize the family. </sentence><sentence id="52">Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his own good. </sentence><sentence id="53">He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year old boys used to do. </sentence><sentence id="54">Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. </sentence><sentence id="55">He was older than I by ten years so he was more a serious person and he had very little in common with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="56">In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were quite a few refugees who would be coming from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> especially those Jews who were exiled from <span class="country">Germany</span> who came from <span class="country">Poland</span> and somehow they didn't stay long enough in the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> and they kept on moving and settled down in our place in <span class="populated place">Louve</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">This was in "39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: What year were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Did you work in the <span class="building">winery</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: No, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="122">We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the <span class="building">winery</span>, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="123">The only time I went to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> or to the <span class="building">winery</span> is to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers. </sentence><sentence id="124">They were there, of course, I recall we had a <span class="building">winery</span> that took <span class="interior space">space</span> a whole <span class="dlf">block</span> because that whole <span class="dlf">block</span> used to belong to us. </sentence><sentence id="125">Underneath in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> under the whole <span class="dlf">block</span> was the whole <span class="building">winery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">I recall that <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five <span class="spatial object">barrels</span> stacked high. </sentence><sentence id="127">They were smaller. </sentence><sentence id="128">They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the <span class="country">United States</span> but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons. </sentence><sentence id="129">This was the standard <span class="spatial object">barrel</span> at that time to age honey wine. </sentence><sentence id="130">I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there. </sentence><sentence id="131">But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business. </sentence><sentence id="132">It could have been that my uncles had took it over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: You lost your father when you were four years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Do you remember him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: Very little. </sentence><sentence id="152">There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old. </sentence><sentence id="153">He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and each <span class="interior space">room</span> was designated for a certain purpose. </sentence><sentence id="154">Beside the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> we had what we used to call <span class="interior space">salon</span> which is a large <span class="region">area</span> and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our friends of the family. </sentence><sentence id="155">So, we had a fairly large <span class="spatial object">flag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">My grandfather who actually brought The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="157">The

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection me up because I lost my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together. </sentence><sentence id="163">That was my family, the immediate family. </sentence><sentence id="164">Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="165">My grandfather brought me up. </sentence><sentence id="166">He was in a way a philosopher on his own. </sentence><sentence id="167">He was a self taught mathematician. </sentence><sentence id="168">He was a true philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="169">Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. </sentence><sentence id="170">He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. </sentence><sentence id="172">Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, he did traditional things with him. </sentence><sentence id="174">He would get up and go to our <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">We used to call it a . </sentence><sentence id="176">He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come <span class="building">home</span> and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">My grandfather, he was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="178">He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="179">He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="180">But his special language was Hebrew and German. </sentence><sentence id="181">By profession he was a <span class="spatial object">printer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">He came from which is south of <span class="populated place">Louve</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from <span class="country">Romania</span>, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close. </sentence><sentence id="186">We were one family. </sentence><sentence id="187">We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. </sentence><sentence id="188">The other <span class="building">brewery</span> in that was right across our <span class="dlf">street</span> so we had a major <span class="dlf">industrial park</span> if you will of <span class="building">breweries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">It was the <span class="building">Isaac Brewery</span> and there was the <span class="building">Brewery</span> and then there was a <span class="building">Brewery</span> and we were all together in it. </sentence><sentence id="190">It was good. </sentence><sentence id="191">I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different <span class="building">stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">We had a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and horses and we would be delivering wine so often. </sentence><sentence id="193">I used to like to go to the <span class="building">barn</span> and every so often just to be together with the horses. </sentence><sentence id="194">So, the whole where we used to live, we used to live on which is a normal whole <span class="dlf">block</span> that compares with any <span class="dlf">block</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span>, it was all one <span class="building">brewery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">We were sort of like a <span class="building">corner house</span> which was a three story <span class="building">corner house</span> that borders on and " That was the main <span class="dlf">road</span> in the <span class="dlf">Louve</span> that carried on for a number of miles. </sentence><sentence id="196">The is sort of almost like a <span class="populated place">district</span>, an <span class="region">area</span> where Jews used to live. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was a dominant <span class="region">area</span> for Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="198">It had many <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there. </sentence><sentence id="200">I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in . </sentence><sentence id="201">The minority in that <span class="region">area</span> were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. </sentence><sentence id="202">There were more Ukrainians in our <span class="region">area</span> than there were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="203">This is not to say that this was typical for -In our <span class="region">area</span> it was typical. </sentence><sentence id="204">The main activity in was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. </sentence><sentence id="205">We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. </sentence><sentence id="206">The potatoes for winter time. </sentence><sentence id="207">The cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those farmers. </sentence><sentence id="208">Of course, we were doing also business at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="209">They were also The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="210">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="211">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="212">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence

usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="215"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection purchasing wine. </sentence><sentence id="216">It wasn't a trade off. </sentence><sentence id="217">It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time. </sentence><sentence id="218">My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special <span class="building">store</span> where it would specialize in Jewish food. </sentence><sentence id="219">It was a vibrant <span class="region">area</span> for Jews to live. </sentence><sentence id="220">It was very interesting and when the <span class="building">market</span> the <span class="building">farmer's market</span> was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted. </sentence><sentence id="221">The whole <span class="region">area</span> was quiet because Friday night we would be going to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, so the <span class="region">area</span> was depleted. </sentence><sentence id="222">Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. </sentence><sentence id="223">So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter. </sentence><sentence id="224">Although the Jewish life continued. </sentence><sentence id="225">When the life in those days and I'm saying "38 and "39 was quite active it was also troublesome. </sentence><sentence id="226">Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems. </sentence><sentence id="227">Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives. </sentence><sentence id="228">The rumors were obviously of what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> and what happened in some other <span class="country">countries</span> like in <span class="country">Romania</span> or <span class="country">Russia</span> although we knew very little of <span class="country">Russia</span> but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically. </sentence><sentence id="229">There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="230">There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in <span class="populated place">Louve</span> and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. </sentence><sentence id="231">We didn't know whether we had to take any action. </sentence><sentence id="232">In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. </sentence><sentence id="233">In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="234">I don't remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the was bombarded. </sentence><sentence id="235">All the <span class="building">houses</span>, one bomb hit our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">We were then in our <span class="interior space">basement</span>, actually in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> was where the <span class="building">winery</span> was, but we no longer had the <span class="building">winery</span> but we had the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">A bomb hit just a part of our <span class="building">house</span>, just a part of it, but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our <span class="building">houses</span> in general, but the <span class="dlf">staircase</span>, for example, which were <span class="dlf">concrete staircases</span>, were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already. </sentence><sentence id="238">When we were in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> we had some other friends and some people were in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. </sentence><sentence id="239">We didn't see any fire. </sentence><sentence id="240">Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other <span class="building">buildings</span> that were attached to our <span class="building">house</span> and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="241">So, that I recall that we were hit by a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided into two major <span class="region">areas</span> with the lights somewhere west of <span class="populated place">Louve</span> and the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="243">This was a new era that we began. </sentence><sentence id="244">The Russians occupied the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of and was part of that <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">I recall when the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> were rolling down from coming from and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">If they were they were somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="247">So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. </sentence><sentence id="248">They kept on moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not changed other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was in a few weeks that all the major <span class="building">homes</span> and <span class="building">businesses</span> were confiscated and we had a The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="249">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="250">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="251">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="252">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="253">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection new regime and so on. </sentence><sentence id="255">This was the <span class="region">Soviet territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">So that means that our <span class="building">house</span> no longer belonged to us. </sentence><sentence id="257">And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago. </sentence><sentence id="258">So, that was a relief in a way. </sentence><sentence id="259">The big question was how do you make a living. </sentence><sentence id="260">My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things. </sentence><sentence id="261">Eli was basically two years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="262">He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches. </sentence><sentence id="263">He didn't feel like going to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">He never cared for that. </sentence><sentence id="265">My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="266">They would put them in <span class="building">prison</span> which was on -- I recall that <span class="building">prison</span> being called . </sentence><sentence id="267">Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli. </sentence><sentence id="269">I continued to study. </sentence><sentence id="270">I continued to go to <span class="building">school</span>, the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> until that time. </sentence><sentence id="271">The subjects my studies were now basically new. </sentence><sentence id="272">First of all since Jewish -- this was a <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. </sentence><sentence id="273">That was a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="274">In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. </sentence><sentence id="275">My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language. </sentence><sentence id="276">She used to, back in "39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. </sentence><sentence id="277">I was better in English than I was in French. </sentence><sentence id="278">That's how I picked up some of my English language. </sentence><sentence id="279">But in the <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="280">You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. </sentence><sentence id="281">In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages. </sentence><sentence id="282">The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided into two <span class="region">areas</span>, the <span class="region">German area</span> which is the <span class="dlf">line</span>, quite a few refugees were coming more so from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> to our <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">Of course the Germans occupied the <span class="region">western Poland</span> so they were directly under the German authority. </sentence><sentence id="284">And Jews were fleeing from that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">I recall that in my <span class="building">class</span> in we received at least three German students one was from , one was from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, two were from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and one from . </sentence><sentence id="286">And there was another fellow who was also a student. </sentence><sentence id="287">He was from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">I don't know he escaped probably from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, but not <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> per se. </sentence><sentence id="289">He was from the <span class="region">Bohemia part</span> that was occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="290">He escaped into <span class="country">Poland</span> and then to the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">He came to us to the <span class="region">Russian occupied part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">In all, they were very jolly fellows. </sentence><sentence id="293">I was 14 or 15 at that time and of course the fellows from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> they tried to speak either Polish or Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their Russian language and the German language they just don't put together. </sentence><sentence id="294">They used to pronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them, but the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys. </sentence></p></dialogue>

more and more from the <span class="region">western part</span>, from <span class="country">Poland</span>, we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> was just bad. </sentence><sentence id="474">They were claiming that the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> are being established. </sentence><sentence id="475">they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. </sentence><sentence id="476">We thought in because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, but these were true persecutions they were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="477">We didn't understand what a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> means. </sentence><sentence id="478">It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="479">It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="480">We didn't know what people would do in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> let alone the <span class="building">establishment</span> and how do you so things people ignored that part. </sentence><sentence id="481">But as they were coming, more by thousands, the <span class="building">shed</span> that we used to have at <span class="building">home</span>, we have opened up, the <span class="interior space">salon</span> and the special <span class="interior space">section room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="482">We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there. </sentence><sentence id="483">We had a large <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and we offered them everything we had. </sentence><sentence id="484">They stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="485">Some of them took to work. </sentence><sentence id="486">Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back <span class="building">home</span> wherever their <span class="building">home</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="487">There was quite a few from , from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> from -- I don't recall the small <span class="populated place">towns</span> in the <span class="region">western part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="488">So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, we had a big <span class="building">house</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="489">It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. </sentence><sentence id="490">That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">I run into that, and they

anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="495">I knew they were crying, really crying. </sentence><sentence id="496">What did they do wrong? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="497">These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="498">They didn't kill them, but they put them away. </sentence><sentence id="499">We found out later that they were sent to and to different parts of <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">I never met them again. </sentence><sentence id="501">Life in continued after

Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't --when I saw we, I'm talking about the family. </sentence><sentence id="512">The family, my mother or my brothers and I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us. </sentence><sentence id="513">We were concerned yet there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate danger. </sentence><sentence id="514">Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be threatened by. </sentence><sentence id="515">As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and Poles. </sentence><sentence id="516">We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a lot that the Germans are very threatening people. </sentence><sentence id="517">We soon found out that the first few weeks in <span class="populated place">Louve</span> after the German occupation of <span class="populated place">Louve</span>, there were quite a few robberies and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="518">Some of them were maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out. </sentence><sentence id="519">It was very dangerous to walk on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="520">Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. </sentence><sentence id="521">That was maybe just as good, but the problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. </sentence><sentence id="522">It was the night first 1:00, then 2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="523">They would rush into the <span class="building">house</span> and if they couldn't find anything, they would destroy or maim people. </sentence><sentence id="524">Only during the night could you hear the night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. </sentence><sentence id="525">This was horrible right during the night. </sentence><sentence id="526">We, at <span class="building">home</span> we were basically safe because on the first <span class="interior space">floor</span> we had a tenant that used to live and apparently he was a . </sentence><sentence id="527">He was half German and half Polish, I think. </sentence><sentence id="528">They occupied that level and they actually controlled the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, not that he would help us directly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that <span class="building">house</span>, so we were basically protected. </sentence><sentence id="529">But you could hear at night the horrible screams being robbed and maimed and so on. </sentence><sentence id="530">It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the premises, the <span class="building">homes</span>, where we used to live, and move into a small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that was . </sentence><sentence id="531">To find a <span class="building">dwelling</span> and to move out, and we didn't have that much time. </sentence><sentence id="532">The <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, the <span class="spatial object">paintings</span>, the <span class="spatial object">rugs</span> that we had, some of that Snyder took in his possession. </sentence><sentence id="533">He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. </sentence><sentence id="534">All the beautiful paintings my father bought in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, and the rugs. </sentence><sentence id="535">It's immaterial now, but at that time it meant a lot to us. </sentence><sentence id="536">So, we moved out with a basic one <span class="spatial object">couch</span> and some of the belongings that we had from the whole <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there. </sentence><sentence id="538">My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us. </sentence><sentence id="539">He was taken away just before we moved out to that small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="540">He apparently went to a <span

where later on it became the major <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">It seems to me it was close to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">He went there and he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="545">We didn't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="546">We heard that later on one <span

in that small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in a free standing <span class="building">home</span> and she offered her <span class="building">house</span> to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="564">I don't know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a <span class="building">house</span> to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an <span class="region">area</span> because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one <span class="region">area</span> to another <span class="region">area</span> where you have a comparable exchange of <span class="building">dwellings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">It wa questionable, but we had it. </sentence><sentence id="566">With our <span class="building">house</span> in that free standing <span class="building">house</span> and I recall there were maybe three <span class="interior space">rooms</span> perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. </sentence><sentence id="567">Now, it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">The faces that we didn't know before all of a sudden we knew them very well. </sentence><sentence id="569">They were all Jews. </sentence><sentence id="570">The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="571">We were not much concerned with them, other than there was another <span class="region">area</span> that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to us. </sentence><sentence id="572">We all of a sudden have a new life in a new <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, new people, new <span class="region">surroundings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="573">The future, who knows what it's going to bring. </sentence><sentence id="574">The rumors were actually in that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you better have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that will help you survive. </sentence><sentence id="575">Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of <span class="populated place">camps</span> or anything of that that we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. </sentence><sentence id="576">That didn't grasp yet. </sentence><sentence id="577">We weren't involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="578">We were involved mostly in our personal belonging, in our personal lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a human being. </sentence><sentence id="579">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> didn't mean to us that this was the end of our <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="580">It was perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="581">You were not directly confronted with the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. </sentence><sentence id="582">The rumors were you better get work. </sentence><sentence id="583">That was in "41. </sentence><sentence id="584">I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work. </sentence><sentence id="585">Where do you find work in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I run across a friend of mine who told me that there is a place on <span class="dlf">Street</span> who -- and they called it that they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. </sentence><sentence id="586">I didn't know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. </sentence><sentence id="587">I went back to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. </sentence><sentence id="588">My mother didn't think that she objected other than she warned me be careful. </sentence><sentence id="589">I went there. </sentence><sentence id="590">I went

favorite brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the <span class="building">house</span> and we would be smoking. </sentence><sentence id="932">So, I kept things in secret. </sentence><sentence id="933">He was very good natured, though. </sentence><sentence id="934">He cared about us.

sure that this was a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, but it was very </sentence></p><p><sentence id="940"> fearsome place to be in. </sentence><sentence id="941">The fact that we heard that and people are being killed there. </sentence><sentence id="942">Even though that I heard that Eli is there, I felt always that when Eli is ina tight spot he always will get out. </sentence><sentence id="943">At least I hoped so. </sentence><sentence id="944">When established the <span class="interior space">living quarters</span>, I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="945">We were a crew of 40 Jews only men. </sentence><sentence id="946">It was a place where we felt was a very safe place at least for the time being. </sentence><sentence id="947">Even it was safe place that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined with each other than others. </sentence><sentence id="948">Probably psychologists would love to study those groups. </sentence><sentence id="949">I was basically with a group of boys my age. </sentence><sentence id="950">The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do we get some cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="951">That was the main thing at that time. </sentence><sentence id="952">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was gone. </sentence><sentence id="953">There was nothing that I can do any more in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="954">I didn't want to go anymore there. </sentence><sentence id="955">As a matter of fact it was a <span class="region">Jew free area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">The only thing that was dominant was actually the <span class="populated place">downtown ghetto</span> on Street and <span

were confined in a given <span class="region">area</span> and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in. </sentence><sentence id="959">Even papers didn't come in. </sentence><sentence id="960">We didn't have any papers. </sentence><sentence id="961">So, the 40 Jews, even though we were together, they had such secrets. </sentence><sentence id="962">I didn't know what the secrets were. </sentence><sentence id="963">I learned later on apparently they built an extra <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="964">There was a <span class="interior

<span class="interior space">living quarters</span> and in that <span class="interior space">basement</span> they erected a <span class="dlf">wall</span> which was done sometime probably before the action in August. </sentence><sentence id="966">I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="967">Nobody let me know that. </sentence><sentence id="968">So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry that they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="969">It was a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="970">It was a whole <span class="dlf">wall</span> and in that false <span class="dlf">wall</span>, false <span class="dlf">partition</span>, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00 they would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="971">Even at that time I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="972">I found that out later.

</sentence><sentence id="1105">He had an excellent rapport with <span class="building">Fessel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1106">He was I think captain in the <span class="building">air

could do <span class="populated place">downtown</span> other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who recognized me. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a <span class="building">movie house</span>, so I went to a <span class="building">movie house</span> just to kill time. </sentence><sentence id="1121">After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what am I going to do next? </sentence><sentence id="1122">I didn't have the answer. </sentence><sentence id="1123">I had to do things that were natural in that point in time. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting. </sentence><sentence id="1125">This was where the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were

own <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> with only 40 Jews was a paradise from what I have seen over here. </sentence><sentence id="1145">People were living in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Just a terrible situation. </sentence><sentence id="1147">No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used to live on the same <span class="dlf">street</span>, she was a daughter of a grocer. </sentence><sentence id="1148">A very pretty young lady, she was probably in her 30s, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1149">She became a prostitute in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1150">But she took me in immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1151">She was my neighbor, and she gave me some <span class="spatial object">slotties</span> and I left went to another place to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an <span

</sentence><sentence id="1153">And I was right in the midst of it. </sentence><sentence id="1154">On suggestion was we get a whole group with the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that group all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask where are you going with this Jewish group. </sentence><sentence id="1155">That was one of the questions. </sentence><sentence id="1156">The other question is where do you the uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Where do you get the <span class="spatial object">arms</span>, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1158">It was a round robin exercise, how to you survive yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1159">The following day I got word that we are safe. </sentence><sentence id="1160">In other words I could go back to and resume my work. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I went back. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong. </sentence><sentence id="1163">It's only time before things happen. </sentence><sentence id="1164">There was another major action sometime later, I forget when in "43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was there. </sentence><sentence id="1165">He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day someone else was going to go to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> also because of action, rescuing someone. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I joined them. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I said I want to go with you. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just in case I catch him. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that place and there was a lady there, an empty <span class="building">house</span> basically and asked her about Eli. </sentence><sentence id="1170">She said he was here, but they picked him up. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I came too late. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I was downhearted. </sentence><sentence id="1173">There was a place that very few people should be going through this exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1174">As I was walking on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, there was one <span class="dlf">fence</span> there and I hear right on the other side of the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, people were praying with a loud voice. </sentence><sentence id="1175">During the action and I kept on walking because I had to get out of that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the armband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I forget the stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1178">It was a swastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1179">So I was safe. </sentence><sentence id="1180">I went through and I got the other people who went with me from and we made our <span class="dlf">exit</span> in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="1181">At that time, I didn't see any <span class="spatial object">buses</span> anymore or any <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1182">They finished the action for the moment so we took our <span class="dlf">exit</span> out. </sentence><sentence id="1183">I went back to . </sentence><sentence id="1184">Eli was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1185">They took him away. </sentence><sentence id="1186">So there was nothing I can do at this point. </sentence><sentence id="1187">He's gone. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The whole family is gone as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Now, a few months went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I don't recall when they had liquidated the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> other than one point in time just prior that we were to be picked up they pronounced that <span class="populated

from there on, I'm thinking more and more about this lady, the limping lady. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly how to go there to get to that place. </sentence><sentence id="1194">There was sometime in the morning, I forget when. </sentence><sentence id="1195">It was a beautiful morning as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="1196">The sun was out, nice and chilly. </sentence><sentence id="1197">Whether it was September or October, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1198">It was sometime in the fall one day we were told that 1:00 we would be picked up. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight, nine, ten. </sentence><sentence id="1200">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I knew

an acquaintance. </sentence><sentence id="1221">A fellow I went to <span class="building">school</span> with, to <span class="building">public school</span>, Sayer his name was and he saw me. </sentence><sentence id="1222">He looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my question is is he going to betray me. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I didn't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1225">He grabbed me and we went to a <span class="dlf">gate</span>, to a <span class="building">house</span> and I told him I need your help. </sentence><sentence id="1226">What do you need? </sentence><sentence id="1227">I said I need you to be here at a certain time, about three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I don't know what time it was then but there was plenty of time. </sentence><sentence id="1229">I thought I'd need him to go to the <span class="building">station</span> to get my ticket because I had my farmer in mind. </sentence><sentence id="1230">But I was on my way to that lady. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Just in case I didn't get any results there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to

to buy the ticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray me. </sentence><sentence id="1234">He said I'll be here at 3:00. </sentence><sentence id="1235">What else do you need. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I told him I didn't need anything other than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I

was <span class="building">barracks</span> where the Ukrainian militia used to live. </sentence><sentence id="1243">There was an <span class="region">area</span> where I felt well, you do or you don't. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I went to one <span class="building">house</span> and I asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, is <span

</sentence><sentence id="1252">I know Maria. </sentence><sentence id="1253">She was limping. </sentence><sentence id="1254">She was a good looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. </sentence><sentence id="1256">She says no <span class="spatial object">Fessel</span> in this <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1257">I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his workers is here. </sentence><sentence id="1258">She says no <span class="building">Fessel</span> is not here. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I took off. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Maybe I was misled. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I took this as a true

</sentence><sentence id="1264">As I walked down I'd say a good half a mile down the <span class="dlf">road</span>, I hear some hollering behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1265">It was Maria with her limping legs was after me. </sentence><sentence id="1266">She was hollering for me to stop. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I finally stopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="1268">You're so stupid and some other expletives. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Come back with me. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And probably I was stupid and she took me back and walked me right into this <span class="interior space">room</span> in this <span class="building">house</span> where Fessel was. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name, how I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Obviously true, Peter could find them. </sentence><sentence id="1273">This was their main concern. </sentence><sentence id="1274">They weren't concerned about me but about Peter. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And Peter he was such a friend that he would never betray me. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So there was no

was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. </sentence><sentence id="1287">He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. </sentence><sentence id="1288">It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different <span class="dlf">route</span>, but the <span class="dlf">route</span> that I know how Fessel got into this <span class="building">house</span> was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in . </sentence><sentence id="1289">So at least two people from our <span class="building">factory</span>, his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend. </sentence><sentence id="1290">That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. </sentence><sentence id="1292">So we had like seven people there. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. </sentence><sentence id="1294">It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. </sentence><sentence id="1295">The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place <span class="building">home</span> and tell him no one was there. </sentence><sentence id="1296">So, I could go and apparently go back <span class="building">home</span> to their place to secure their hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1297">It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his place. </sentence><sentence id="1298">They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1299">They left it at that. </sentence><sentence id="1300">So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe place for the time being. </sentence><sentence id="1301">The <span class="region">area</span> we were in one <span class="interior space">room</span> I think maybe it was another <span class="interior space">room</span>, but basically I was in the front in the large <span class="interior space">room</span> that was together with this hiding family. </sentence><sentence id="1302">We had a <span class="dlf">trap door</span> to the <span class="interior space">basement</span> which was not in the walking place but in a <span class="interior space">crawling space</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1303">We had a special <span class="region">area</span> that was covered with a <span class="env feature">rock</span> in case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We had our food. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Apparently <span class="building">Fessel</span> had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria. </sentence><sentence id="1306">I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. </sentence><sentence id="1307">I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either. </sentence><sentence id="1308">So, I thought things were taken care of by <span class="building">Fessel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1309">The other couple they also were from <span class="populated place">Louve</span>, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1311">There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. </sentence><sentence id="1313">I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. </sentence><sentence id="1314">There was a point in time the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> is being liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="1315">The rumors were also that the <span class="building">Russian army</span> is moving toward <span class="country">Poland</span>, closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="1316">They weren't talking about immediate occupation or immediate conquer of the <span class="region">territory</span> but it was close enough that you need to make a decision. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Whether to stay in the <span class="region">hiding place</span> or to move on. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I did not take any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So that wasn't an option that would be denied to me. </sentence><sentence id="1320">The other option was whether or not to escape <span class="populated place">Louve</span> all together. </sentence><sentence id="1321">There was a young couple who would be coming and in keeping in touch with us. </sentence><sentence id="1322">They had Gentile papers and they had excellent <span class="region">Gentile features</span> and they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1323">They would know how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Now the question was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of <span class="populated place">Louve</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1325">They The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

at that time at all. </sentence><sentence id="1332">The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I could always stay here, but I want to get out of <span class="populated place">Louve</span> in general. </sentence><sentence id="1335">This is a horrible place. </sentence><sentence id="1336">I don't want to be here, even in hiding.

id="1339">He apparently was good enough to do that for me. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to <span class="country">Hungary</span> from <span

and everything else was true on those papers. </sentence><sentence id="1350">My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my religion. </sentence><sentence id="1351">From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something very interesting happened that I recall. </sentence><sentence id="1352">You know when you are in hiding for so many months you don't know how to purchase things. </sentence><sentence id="1353">How to deal with the outside although we are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the <span

not about to buy any tickets for us, so they asked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main <span class="building">station</span>, look around, see where the purchase ticket box is, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1358">Well, I went there. </sentence><sentence id="1359">One night they left me and I had to go from the place at night walking through the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, through the <span class="building">barracks</span> of the militia and there is a small <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1739">Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1742">I never asked her. </sentence><sentence id="1743">The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="1744">The fact that I saw her one day in a <span class="building">factory</span> walking towards the <span class="building">office</span> that means she was prearranged. </sentence><sentence id="1745">She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. </sentence><sentence id="1746">I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening. </sentence><sentence id="1747">He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money. </sentence><sentence id="1748">He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth. </sentence><sentence id="1750">She had this <span class="building">house</span> and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion. </sentence><sentence id="1751">Maybe it was a combination of both. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1763">Q: Was this a very lonely time for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1765">A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I was very active. </sentence><sentence id="1767">My mind was always going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. </sentence><sentence id="1768">My question was to myself how do you get out of this place. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I was fierce about it. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I was driven by that. </sentence><sentence id="1771">How do you get out and stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="1772">Because I felt that I had to say something later on. </sentence><sentence id="1773">Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part. </sentence><sentence id="1774">So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. </sentence><sentence id="1775">I was too dynamic to be lonely. </sentence><sentence id="1776">So, when they saw me coming back from that <span class="building">train station</span> and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had. </sentence><sentence id="1777">I don't think I had anything with me. </sentence><sentence id="1778">I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="1779">We went

</sentence><sentence id="1786">That couple that I forget their name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1787">All of us left, including the lady friend of Fessel's brother. </sentence><sentence id="1788">By the way, she was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="1789">She was big and my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was walking and she was also determined to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1790">We were on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and got picked up later on in by the smugglers who were

class="region">area</span> probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. </sentence><sentence id="1810">By the way, this <span class="region">area</span> was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and <span class="building">border police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1811">The smugglers were actually Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I forget their name. </sentence><sentence id="1813">I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the <span class="env feature">Tatra mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1814">The episode that I recall was walking in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1815">It was so called and also the snow was very deep. </sentence><sentence id="1816">The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a <span class="dlf">trap</span> because you couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="1817">It was a very difficult walk. </sentence><sentence id="1818">Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking. </sentence><sentence id="1819">At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had boots. </sentence><sentence id="1820">So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her. </sentence><sentence id="1821">No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="1822">The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem. </sentence><sentence id="1823">He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode. </sentence><sentence id="1824">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="1825">I felt good. </sentence><sentence id="1826">I was strong and I tried to help her. </sentence><sentence id="1827">I did help her. </sentence><sentence id="1828">I kept on walking with her. </sentence><sentence id="1829">At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and embracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. </sentence><sentence id="1830">At one point in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I couldn't leave her. </sentence><sentence id="1832">I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Such a shame, but we survived. </sentence><sentence id="1834">We went through the <span class="env feature">Tatra mountains</span> and got into <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1835">At least we were there. </sentence><sentence id="1836">We were so called safe and the <span class="building">boarder police</span> grabbed us. </sentence><sentence id="1837">They took us into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from <span class="country">Poland</span>, so we were all Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1838">So, from this <span class="region">police area</span> I think they took us into a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1839">We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. </sentence><sentence id="1840">I don't recall how long we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1841">There was another couple from <span class="country">Poland</span>, independently they came in. </sentence><sentence id="1842">They were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1843">One was a professor | think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people. </sentence><sentence

evening. </sentence><sentence id="1852">It was a Friday I think and the reason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us <span class="populated place">LA</span> is a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1853">It was very good, very tasty. </sentence><sentence id="1854">This was the first time I was exposed to

thought was to run to get into <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1876">The way you could get to <span class="country">Turkey</span> was through <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1882">A better way is to go through <span class="country">Turkey</span> through <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1883">I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Some of these people were mostly Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1885">Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1886">I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the <span class="building">Polish

</sentence><sentence id="2189">Of course on the buttocks and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It was very painful, but I took it. </sentence><sentence id="2191">It wasn't a big thing that I recall it was impossible not to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2192">They wanted to know again, what was the message that I was trying to deliver to <span class="populated place">Rumania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2193">Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being Jewish wasn't their concern apparently. </sentence><sentence id="2194">I don't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Whether they took it for granted one way or the other, I was never told. </sentence><sentence id="2196">The main idea for them was to move me as soon as possible back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and they took me back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and they put me in a <span class="building">political prison</span> on . </sentence><sentence id="2197">That was the <span class="building">political prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost. </sentence><sentence

him later on after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what was my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession. </sentence><sentence id="2208">A fellow that I befriended in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> who was from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, he was also a Jewish refugee but for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had fun with him and he was in that <span class="building">prison</span> also. </sentence><sentence id="2209">They caught him, so they wanted to know what was my association with him. </sentence><sentence id="2210">So it was a complication. </sentence><sentence id="2211">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="2212">I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow. </sentence><sentence id="2213">He was a fellow that I would feel very comfortable to be a friend. </sentence><sentence id="2214">Sometime later after 1944 I remember we were about to be ready to be moved out of this <span class="building">prison</span> and we were told that they are going to send us to some kind of <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2215">It must have been some time in October because I recall I got in, they brought us to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944 that we walked on that <span class="dlf">platform</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2216">It was a <span

they did, maybe I did have it. </sentence><sentence id="2226">I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2227">I was one of the inmates now. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2229">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Maybe I don't want to remember, but we were close to that <span class="building">barrack</span> where there was a special <span class="building">barrack</span> where things were -- a punitive <span class="building">barrack</span> and I was told to stay away from it, that <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2231">Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed. </sentence><sentence id="2232">My only question was how do I get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

right, and they selected me. </sentence><sentence id="2293">I think it was a left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. </sentence><sentence id="2294">Took me back into my <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2295">It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they look at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that | all of a sudden get to my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2296">But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2297">One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2298">When they were brought back, they took out the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> to watch the hanging. </sentence><sentence id="2299">That was sometime probably in December. </sentence><sentence id="2300">It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the morning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2301">Then again there's a <span class="dlf">gap</span> that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily consumption of the stale bread. </sentence><sentence id="2302">The bread came from the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> from the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> from the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, but we were given stale bread. </sentence><sentence id="2303">It was just at least it was something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2304">The food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. </sentence><sentence id="2305">But I was not -- didn't feel that bad. </sentence><sentence id="2306">I still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were talking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were moving in closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="2307">As a matter of fact, our thought was that was already taken. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very close. </sentence><sentence id="2309">So, the recreation of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was almost eminent. </sentence><sentence id="2310">January 5, comes to my mind but I'll stand corrected if it was something else. </sentence><sentence id="2311">We were evacuated from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we walked a long time to another <span class="building">station</span>, and I don't recall too well but we were put into open <span class="spatial object">carts</span>, only men. </sentence><sentence id="2312">I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. </sentence><sentence id="2313">A horrible trip, a horrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. </sentence><sentence id="2314">I had frostbite on both feet. </sentence><sentence id="2315">They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2316">I always felt that I could survive. </sentence><sentence id="2317">There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the way I used to. </sentence><sentence id="2318">We were, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was moving through <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2319">I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath the <span class="dlf">overpasses</span>, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to us in the open <span class="spatial object">cart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2320">It was a good omen. </sentence><sentence id="2321">I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine with whom I've been for since

and he was in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2323">He saw me sometime later in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2324">He visited me in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2325">We went out and they kept us moving along from place to place. </sentence><sentence id="2326">There was no place that they
