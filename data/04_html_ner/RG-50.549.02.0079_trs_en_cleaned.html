deg it's funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the -- anyhow, I don't know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for me is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the wedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn't do -- done very much about that. </sentence><sentence id="200">And -- but you have
