very, it was a panic stricken Jewish population trying to decide whether it was better to run or to stay. </sentence><sentence id="19">And during this mad rush to get out, with the Russians, I think at that point already the Lithuanian partisans went into actions and fell upon some innocent victims who were trying to escape. </sentence><sentence id="20">But I think the real partisan mass murders

waiting um and at that point I think there were about 28,000 Jews in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so all of them or most of them were assembled on the <span
