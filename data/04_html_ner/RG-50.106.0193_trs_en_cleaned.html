he had known that he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1423">But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">So he then knew,

hacking, right. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Murdoch now has been doing. </sentence><sentence id="1443">But this was sort of mentality. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So then Otto said don't come

you should do, what you shouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1452">But before that after that, when Otto was in <span class="country">England</span>, he wrote to me that he had a network of friends

The Italians didn't want that. </sentence><sentence id="1464">But ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So he then, this friend from him, who settled in <span class="country">Italy</span>, wrote to Otto and told him send your brother. </sentence><sentence id="1466">He knew Kurt. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And he actually stayed with them in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1468">They said send him by air, because the Italians had not yet realized that you can fly and that you can arrive in the <span class="country">country</span>, the border people, the <span class="building">border police</span> was trained. </sentence><sentence id="1469">You see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew. </sentence><sentence id="1470">At the <span class="building">airports</span> they hadn't trained police, trained people who spoke there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

and it was when they were together, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2547">I mean Mussolini was Hitler's role model. </sentence><sentence id="2548">He really, he wasn't anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his -- you know that Mussolini invented the term fascisma [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="2549">So you know he was the role model.

I think you must remember this out of my autobiography. </sentence><sentence id="2553">Then we were still there when Mussolini occupied <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2575">And we thought, we sat together. </sentence><sentence id="2576">And we thought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2577">And here were these little policemen worried about our life. </sentence><sentence id="2578">It was really very moving. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And I tell them that now too so they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming. </sentence><sentence id="2580">They would come <span class="dlf">ashore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2581">So first of all you have to find a <span class="building">house</span> with a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> because not many <span class="building">houses</span> had <span class="interior space">cellars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2582">Only the richest. </sentence><sentence id="2583">And the richest had gone <span class="region">inland</span>, the Albanian. </sentence><sentence id="2584">But they left their servants to take care of their -- but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2585">The servants wanted to stop us or they weren't too strong, strong enough to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2586">So we found a <span class="building">house</span> not too far from where our <span class="building">house</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="2587">But before this I must tell you, there were <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods.

</sentence><sentence id="2592">You must think everybody fell into, that was my life. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And so he asked my father for give information so that he could marry me.

</sentence><sentence id="2598">And anyway when it comes then a little story and a little lie. </sentence><sentence id="2599">So we stayed in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> during the onslaught and we heard the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="2600">And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting. </sentence><sentence id="2601">And said let's surrender. </sentence><sentence

let's do it with our heads up. </sentence><sentence id="2604">Let's show them that we have courage. </sentence><sentence id="2605">So ok. </sentence><sentence id="2606">So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and somebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us. </sentence><sentence id="2607">Well who could do that? </sentence><sentence id="2608">I was the only one. </sentence><sentence id="2609">In teaching German and French I picked up, I'm not fluent but I picked up. </sentence><sentence id="2610">So they gave me a stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead. </sentence><sentence id="2611">So I led and I was trying to say in Italian, as best as I could. </sentence><sentence id="2612">We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept repeating this in my mind as we were walking along. </sentence><sentence id="2613">And we must have been a really crazy lot, looking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2614">Anyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and saw us. </sentence><sentence id="2615">And shouted halt. </sentence><sentence id="2616">So I said stop. </sentence><sentence id="2617">So we stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2618">And then as I had expected, he came up to me and said who are you? </sentence><sentence id="2619">And so and he did. </sentence><sentence id="2620">So I then said in my, in the sentences I had rehearsed. </sentence><sentence id="2621">I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn't let me go any further. </sentence><sentence id="2622">I didn't get, have to say Jewish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2623">He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedeski, German. </sentence><sentence id="2624">Italian, friends, amigo,. </sentence><sentence id="2625">amigo. </sentence><sentence id="2626">I didn't disillusion him. </sentence><sentence id="2627">And so in a sense that was another saving. </sentence><sentence id="2628">So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking. </sentence><sentence id="2629">He said where do you live?And I said over there. </sentence><sentence id="2630">I didn't say that was the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2631">And so he walked us back. </sentence><sentence id="2632">But on the way back I thought well if they look through our <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and if the police had wanted to hide their guns, then they might have put some into our <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and if these Italian soldiers find them then the friendship will be off. </sentence><sentence id="2633">But they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2634">They let us go. </sentence><sentence id="2635">They looked through them but the soldiers said the police hadn't hidden anything. </sentence><sentence id="2636">But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the <span class="dlf">window</span> looking out at the <span class="env feature">wasteland</span> and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had a very small unit of soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2637">And he made me understand that he wants clothing. </sentence><sentence

his uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2639">So I gave him one pajama of my father. </sentence><sentence id="2640">And he stuck, changed there and this was my contribution to the freedom fight of <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2641">But then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his <span class="spatial object">car</span> came to our <span class="building">residence</span> and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And it was addressed to me. </sentence><sentence id="2643">So they were all excited. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Says now we mean, we are being sent to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2645">And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and he sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his <span class="spatial object">car</span>, was picking me up and there are so many <span class="dlf">guard posts</span> on the way because they had just occupied <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2646">I actually went last July when I made this film because King Zog's <span class="spatial object">car</span> was at the top of the <span class="env feature">hill</span> and of course King Zog had fled. </sentence><sentence id="2647">So this new governor of the <span class="populated place">city</span> had moved into King Zog's <span class="building">castle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2648">So we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it. </sentence><sentence id="2649">So they allowed us in because there weren't many people. </sentence><sentence id="2650">So this is and then I have to -- and then my Greek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was the pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent. </sentence><sentence id="2651">Because I had gone, since we had the visas for <span class="country">England</span>, I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the only airline that would fly from <span class="country">Albania</span> to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2652">So that's the <span class="spatial object">plane</span> that I thought we were taking. </sentence><sentence id="2653">But they told me I should go to the French ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards. </sentence><sentence id="2654">We would have, my mother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel. </sentence><sentence id="2655">But they did not. </sentence><sentence id="2656">And they said we do not want refugees in our <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2657">At a later date they may have had different stories. </sentence><sentence id="2658">So then among this lot of young men, was one <span class="building">travel agent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2659">So I asked him. </sentence><sentence id="2660">I said well how can I get from here because I can't go by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2661">I have to go you know flying there. </sentence><sentence id="2662">I can't fly. </sentence><sentence id="2663">So how do I get there. </sentence><sentence id="2664">So he then said there is one <span class="spatial object">cargo ship</span> that goes from <span class="populated place">Naples</span> to <span class="populated place">Southampton</span> and if you board that, there was one coming that would get you to <span class="populated place">Southampton</span> on the 25" of April. </sentence><sentence id="2665">So that was all right. </sentence><sentence id="2666">So and we paid him and the Joint sent money for our friend. </sentence><sentence id="2667">I had one. </sentence><sentence id="2668">But this <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> guy said my dear I want to give you 500 pound. </sentence><sentence id="2669">I want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And I thought no, I'm not being bought for 500 pounds and said no I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2671">He then said well look don't be so silly. </sentence><sentence id="2672">P'll give you the 500 and you take it. </sentence><sentence id="2673">If you do not need them. </sentence><sentence id="2674">If you don't have to use them I'll give you my, the details of my bank account in <span class="populated place">London</span> and you pay the 500 pounds into that <span

writing it down. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Because I am sure there is a lot of <span class="populated place">Salonika</span> money invested in the British and American banks. </sentence><sentence

mean if we can't get to <span class="country">England</span> then he can't do anything but at least he would know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2969">But then I looked up and you know this

had to refuel on the way. </sentence><sentence id="2985">So we had a tough time. </sentence><sentence id="2986">But the only airline that would take us was <span class="building">KLM</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2987">But <span class="building">KLM</span> was, we were boarding and we had to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated

could get onto the <span class="spatial object">KLM flight</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2989">And the KLM flight went, <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>, <span class="populated

then you know where we to look. </sentence><sentence id="2994">But that's all I could say and I gave him the time we were due. </sentence><sentence id="2995">But then I said well how do I get it to him. </sentence><sentence id="2996">So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is another one who had saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="2997">Because really when you come and see you know

id="3007">So I said no, we're not returning to your <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3008">I said you can see we have an English visa and that's what our tickets say and that's where we are going. </sentence><sentence id="3009">So he said ok and thankful. </sentence><sentence id="3010">And we sat down but then when we got to <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="3012">And they announced over the <span class="spatial object">loudspeaker</span> Frau Und [ph] report. </sentence><sentence id="3013">So I then thought well couldn't we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports because everybody had to fill out so then that's when the worst (inaudible) in my life. </sentence><sentence id="3014">Because two Nazi bitches, really you can't use any other term. </sentence><sentence id="3015">They were in the female SA, SS uniforms, black skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small <span class="interior space">room</span> and then said now strip. </sentence><sentence id="3016"><span class="dlf">Strip</span>? </sentence><sentence id="3017">I felt you know I couldn't say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling. </sentence><sentence id="3018">They went through every <span class="dlf">seam</span> in our you know skirts and I mean I can't describe and then they were beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop helping this cow of a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3019">And I mean it just, I don't want to remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3020">But then fortunately I had this letter. </sentence><sentence id="3021">I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my <span class="spatial

my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn't have but they hadn't been through everything that I had. </sentence><sentence id="3025">I said that's the only thing that we" ll say. </sentence><sentence id="3026">So I said don't you understand Italian. </sentence><sentence id="3027">And they said no. </sentence><sentence id="3028">I said well then you're very stupid and I got a big beating but then she said well what does it say? </sentence><sentence id="3029">So I then said but I read out something which wasn't there at all. </sentence><sentence id="3030">I said and I know the governor.
