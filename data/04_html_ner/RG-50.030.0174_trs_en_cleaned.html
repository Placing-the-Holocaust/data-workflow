There were always in the family an uncle or another person that always will test you on a Saturday night what you learned in <span class="building">school</span> during the week. </sentence><sentence id="54">And your reward was a five cents that was that was good to buy an ice cream cone. </sentence><sentence id="55">For ten cents you can buy a <span class="spatial object">chocolate bar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">So if we ...if I made by mine... It was my mother's uncle; if 1 made by him a dime, it was uh really a big winning. </sentence><sentence id="57">And for we our day start off like early in the morning we would go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> to pray with the people to with my father and older brother and doing uh we will come <span class="building">home</span> say like if we would start at seven, seven thirty we'll be <span class="building">home</span>, have breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="58">And by nine o'clock we start our <span class="building">school</span> day. </sentence><sentence id="59">So we, I went to a , a <span class="building">Hebrew school</span>, and from nine  And at four o'clock, we only had like a five minutes break to buy a little something like a chocolate or a candy, or... And we went back to - it was in the same <span class="building">building</span> - went back to <span class="building">school</span> and learned from four "til six. </sentence><sentence id="60">And at six o'clock, my mother would give me like a nickel or a dime and I would buy myself a roll of butter with a piece of herring, some nights with cheese, and go back to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">It was like a ..... (ph), and there we will try to do our homework. </sentence><sentence id="62">Work mostly in the Talmud what we learn in our , and then we drop them in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and we went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">there was no <span class="spatial object">television</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">We did not have the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">I recall we had like a <span class="interior space">three room apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">In the <span class="interior space">three room apartment</span> we slept uh two in one <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and there was <span class="spatial object">beds</span> that was, they opened up. </sentence><sentence id="67">One child will sleep, one brother with the head one side and the other one will sleep with the head the other side, so their feet will - so that was more convenient to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="68">And the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> were a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, then a <span class="interior space">dining room</span>, and a <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and my father and mother slept in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> with the younger children. </sentence><sentence id="69">We seemed always to have enough <span class="interior space">room</span> if somebody else came over to sleep over. </sentence><sentence id="70">We did not have the toys that the uh - what we used to do, we couldn't even afforded to buy uh rubber ball, because I played soccer - when I had a little chance, I play I liked to play soccer, so we would take some rags, roll them them up, sew them up like in when it was finished looked almost like a <span class="spatial object">baseball</span> with the stitches - that's what we would kick around. </sentence><sentence id="71">Very seldom it has a bounce. </sentence><sentence id="72">But we had a very, maybe we didn't see anything better, but we were very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="73">And everything uh everybody was looking forward, we knew there were things getting bad in <span class="country">Poland</span> cause since uh when I start to recognize and understand certain things, that in 1935, "36, when the Marshall of <span class="country">Poland</span>, Marshall Pilsudski, had died, the anti-Semitism because maybe they wanted, the Poles want to be friendly with the Germans or maybe that was in fashion like they say, anti-Semitism had start growing in <span class="country">Poland</span> to a very untolerable situation. </sentence><sentence id="74">But we lived in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> <span class="populated place">Kazimierz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">And it was strictly... It was called the Kazimierz, after the Kazimierz, the great King Kazimierz who let the Jews come into <span class="country">Poland</span> with so many hundred years back. </sentence><sentence id="76">And in , mostly was Jewish, <span class="building">Jewish stores</span>, <span class="building">Jewish shopkeepers</span>, <span class="building">Jewish synagogues</span>, so I personally did not have any connection, special connection with gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="77">We had our own life. </sentence><sentence id="78">Of course we learned in <span class="building">school</span> Polish but uh we did not come in any contact and we, our business and our daily life had no mingling with the Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="79">And there was, I overheard all our politicking was going on in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I overheard the, as a child 1 liked to listen that the uh some young people were and they were screaming to the older people that Hitler may be coming and conquer <span class="country">Poland</span> - we have to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I don't know from the olderies (ph) first of all we were told, respect the elder people. </sentence><sentence id="82">When an elder person spoke, we were quiet. </sentence><sentence id="83">We only listened. </sentence><sentence id="84">We wouldn't dare even answer them anything. </sentence><sentence id="85">So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I.They are cultured. </sentence><sentence id="86">They're intelligent and the argument was going with some, we would come and that after all, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, and he's out to destroy the  had a, they may had a little uh piece of ring or piece of gold, some silverware, but wealth, currency - very few Jews had because they had always to borrow when it came a sabbath or when it came a high holiday, or any holidays if they want to prepare a <span class="spatial object">table</span> they had to go out and borrow some money, so currency nobody had. </sentence><sentence id="87">And it was very hard for a family of eight or ten to go - nobody, no <span class="country">country</span> in the world would take them, and of course we did not have the state or vision (ph), so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there would be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity, have the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: What happened when the war did break out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: But in 1939, we were first worried that my father may be taken to the army. </sentence><sentence id="131">He was born in 1900, and he was only 39 years old. </sentence><sentence id="132">But a few weeks before the war broke out, they changed the slip of paper - the there were red cards, blue cards, white cards, and there was must have been that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when the war broke out - that they did not call him to the army. </sentence><sentence id="133">And the war broke out on September 1, 1939, on a Friday morning. </sentence><sentence id="134">To me, I didn't know what's in <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">To me it wasn't the most uh important thing. </sentence><sentence id="136">To me it was more important we had uh a championship going to <span class="populated place">Macabi</span>, the soccer team, and that was important to me, but on Wednesday morning I went out near the <span class="region">outskirts</span> from the <span class="spatial object">Wis_a</span> [NB: the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="137"><span class="env feature">Wis_a</span> is the <span class="env feature">lake</span> [NB: <span class="env feature">river</span>] that runs through <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I went over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> to <span class="populated place">Mos</span>, <span class="populated place">Mostowa</span> (ph) and I saw already Germans. </sentence><sentence id="139">So I ran back to my dad because my dad received then to go into the army, to be in the next few days near <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> at a certain <span class="building">post</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">So I screamed to and I told my dad don't go because the Germans are already here. </sentence><sentence id="141">And the Germans came into <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> on Wednesday. </sentence><sentence id="142">That was September the 6th. </sentence><sentence id="143">And to say they didn't bother us, we didn't bother them. </sentence><sentence id="144">But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I liked to run from one <span class="building">shul</span>, from one <span class="building">synagogue</span> or one <span class="building">temple</span> to the other <span class="building">temple</span> to listen to the cantor singing, and as I was going in the <span class="dlf">street</span> on the , most of our <span class="building">synagogues</span> had open <span class="dlf">doors</span> to the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="145">They were not SS. </sentence><sentence id="146">I learned later about <span class="building">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147"><span class="region">Plain</span> Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="148">Went into the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, pulled out the Jews, older people, took the <span class="spatial object">thales</span>, the <span class="spatial object">skrols</span>, throw it in the <span class="spatial object">garbage</span>, ripped it up and literally they say that they took out the Jews to shave their beards and their [side]locks, and literally I saw them ripping - blood was gushing from their faces from the people and they were laughing and they were smile and then I realized that something is wrong somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="149">That I couldn't believe my own eyes, what I saw, and we made up our mind at that time, in our <span class="building">house</span> we had built-in <span class="interior space">closets</span> so we built in a <span class="dlf">double wall</span>, and we hide our father, because our father still had a beard, and we and he didn't want to shave his beard because of the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="150">And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the <span class="dlf">street</span> he will be recognized as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="151">So we did all our, whatever work we, whatever little business, whatever to sustain our family, my older brother, myself and my younger two brothers, we did our dealings, and it was till maybe October or November when the first snow came on the on the , not only the snow on Ka...on our <span class="dlf">street</span> - it's snowing all  through my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice, Juden (ph), dirty Jews. </sentence><sentence id="152"> pulled my pants down. </sentence><sentence id="153">And I... They start asking me where I live, and I didn't want to give up my family, give out my family. </sentence><sentence id="154">So I stayed and I said uh whatever will happen will happen; and one of the Gestapo came out and he says to the Polish policeman, there's a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in the <span class="building">train station</span> full of Jews that they are being deported to a <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Bia_a Podlaska</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">That was on the <span class="region">east side</span>, near the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> where the Russians took part of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156"><span class="populated place">Lemberg</span>, <span class="populated place">Lwow</span>--near that <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">And he even used the word: "Take that little scheiss and put him on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="158">So I was on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">I was very happy to be on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">And I came to <span class="populated place">Bia_a Podlaska</span>; and I wrote <span class="building">home</span> a letter and saying, "Dad and Ma - I can escape because nobody's watching me. </sentence><sentence id="161">Should I come <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="162">I'm coming <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="163">So I immediately got back a letter not to come <span class="building">home</span>, that they were already marked also to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="164">They were not accepted to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because my father had no trade. </sentence><sentence id="165">And very seldom do they took seven, a family of with seven, eight, nine people into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">They took to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> young people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show papers and those special papers was called the , and if they got the , that means if you work, then you could go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">Many people had signed up to work in the <span class="building">factory</span> <span class="populated place">Emailia</span>, <span class="building">NKF</span> [NB: <span class="building">Neue Kiihler- und Flugzeugteile-Fabrik</span>] by Schindler. </sentence><sentence id="168">People paid, they signed out if they own a <span class="building">house</span>, diamonds, whatever they could lay their hands on, to get those papers to be able to stay in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">My father and mother and the six children was sent away to <span class="populated place">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="populated place">Podlaski</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="170"><span class="building">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="populated place">Podlaski</span>], from <span class="populated place">Bia_a Podlaska</span>, from <span class="country">Russia</span> is no more than twenty-one kilometer. </sentence><sentence id="171">That's about fifteen miles. </sentence><sentence id="172">And one morning, I'm walking in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and I see my father . [ </sentence><sentence id="173">said to my father, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="174">He said, "Come. </sentence><sentence id="175">I came to take you <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">We are all in <span class="populated place">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="populated place">Podlaski</span>]." </sentence><sentence id="177">So we stayed in <span class="populated place">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="populated place">Podlaski</span>], and we were told then the reason we are sent in this direction of the <span class="region">east</span> that the <span class="dlf">fields</span> are more fertilized. </sentence><sentence id="178">It's easier to feed the people. </sentence><sentence id="179">And we were hoping that this is the case. </sentence><sentence id="180">And that was April, May; and my brother and myself were assigned to work for the Germans, to cut the <span class="dlf">furrows</span> and to make <span class="dlf">roads</span> for the <span class="spatial object">aeroplanes</span>, to make <span class="dlf">aeroplane fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">Because the Germans had in their mind to start to attack the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="182">And June 22nd in 1941, the war with Russians had started; and my brother and myself, every night we could go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">The fact is while we were walking <span class="building">home</span>, about ten kilometers, we were stopping at a farmer, exchange - money was not worth anything - but exchange for little something. </sentence><sentence id="184">He would give us some potatoes, some corn, some food. </sentence><sentence id="185">And that's how we sustain ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="186">When the war broke out on June 22nd, they tell us we cannot go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">And they start putting <span class="dlf">wires</span> around us and they said they are making a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">And they need our work. </sentence><sentence id="189">They need to load up some stuff and one day, before they start putting the electric wire on it, my brother and myself escaped. </sentence><sentence id="190">And we ran in for five minutes to our father's <span class="building">home</span>, and we said we're not going to stay in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">We running back to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">We going to sneak in in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">We're going to be in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194"><span class="populated place">Krakow</span> is a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">Maybe we can pass for Aryan. </sentence><sentence id="196">We're going to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">So we start by foot. </sentence><sentence id="198">And when we came in like half-way, near the <span class="dlf">Wis_a</span>; and I was stuck in in &gt; <span class="populated place">Nowy Korczyn</span>, in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="199">My brother was stuck in <span class="populated place">Staszow</span>, by a family. </sentence><sentence id="200">I had no food to eat, so during that time, it was like in July, there were on the <span class="env feature">trees</span> some green apples, and I ate those green apples and I have uh (ph)_ diarrhea and I got very sick, so I was going from place to place and finally near <span class="populated place">Nowy Korczyn</span> there was a Polish family who  Only thing I want is to get a little better and get some potatoes, uh cooked potatoes, so...so my stomach will get better." </sentence><sentence id="201">And meantime, in...in <span class="populated place">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="populated place">Podlaski</span>], my family was starving. </sentence><sentence id="202">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="203">There was no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="204">So my father put on clothes like uh...like a man [who] was a farmer, and he got himself a a paper that he is uh like a Polish farmer. </sentence><sentence id="205">And he went back to his brother to <span class="populated place">O_arew</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">And my mother took five children, dressed like a peasant girl, took a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and came into <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">And when she came back to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>, the <span class="dlf">gates</span> for the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed off. </sentence><sentence id="208">We had an uncle in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so he sent out somebody. </sentence><sentence id="209">And he said, "The best thing for you is to go like twenty-five, thirty kilometer. </sentence><sentence id="210">Near...there's a <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Proszowice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Near <span class="populated place">Proszowice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">You can go there and get from a farmer a <span class="interior space">room</span> for you for your family." </sentence><sentence id="213">So she did that. </sentence><sentence id="214">She had a few zlotys--that's Polish currency--and she rented; and the place was called <span class="populated place">Stagniowice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">So in 1941, maybe it was September, October, she rented a one-room <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And my father couldn't stand uh being without his wife and children, so from <span class="populated place">O_arew</span> he went to <span class="populated place">Staszow</span> and collected my younger brother, and from <span class="populated place">Staszow</span> they come to [<span class="populated place">Nowy</span>] <span class="populated place">Korczyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">We wrote letters to each other into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to my uncle, Isaac Levenstein (ph), who was my mother's brother. </sentence><sentence id="218">He stayed with his wife and two children in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">He had...he happened to have in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> a <span class="building">factory</span> from before the war that was like Brillos, but without the soap, and he maked those Brillos for the soldiers, for the for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="220">So he had the privilege, him and another partner, to stay in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">So we had our con...contact through that uncle, so my father knew by which farmer I was uh near <span class="populated place">Nowy Korczyn</span>, and it was after the holiday, high holiday, and he collected me and we all went and we finally hooked up together with my mother and she was there with five children. </sentence><sentence id="222">And we were all nine again together from 1941, by October; and was the happiest days of our life. </sentence><sentence id="223">In one <span class="interior space">room</span>, nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="224">And the greatest pain that I can see, when my mother was cooking some food (crying) and she would say she's not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="225">We knew she was hungry, but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food because she wouldn't take it away from her children. </sentence><sentence id="226">We...again we had to register in the Jewish because to get some rationing, some food. </sentence><sentence id="227">Without it we couldn't sustain  were on the <span class="region">outskirts</span> from <span class="populated place">Proszowice</span>, and maybe nobody put up a list on it. </sentence><sentence id="228">And they...they made, it was called <span class="building">visedlenie</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="229">That means taking the people out. </sentence><sentence id="230">There was always, they always take out some people and the rest they left over because they said we need you. </sentence><sentence id="231">So the, now the hindsight, the Monday morning quarterback, I would understand that they took out the men so the women and the children could not put up the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="232">When they had us in <span class="populated place">camp</span> where they make <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> already, and they change it from a regular <span class="populated place">camp</span> to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">Tell me you had no choice to fight. </sentence><sentence id="234">You couldn't fight. </sentence><sentence id="235">You couldn't escape. </sentence><sentence id="236">So in 1942, in the meantime, they open up a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, what's called in <span class="populated place">Krakow-P_aszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">It was old <span class="populated place">Ierozolimska</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="238">It was a new <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and it was called <span class="populated place">Ierozolimska</span> (ph) and that <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> was a Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="239">So on that <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, they build <span class="building">barracks</span>--<span class="building">factories</span>, that they make shoes, uniforms, brushes, whatever they could get the work out from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="240">The knit...<span class="building">knitting factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">They make sweaters, socks. </sentence><sentence id="242">And they prepared this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">So from the <span class="building">brick factory</span> and from U lag, I myself with my brother were united...with my older brother; and we stayed in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">In the first there was an <span class="building">Obersturmfiihrer Miller</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="245">He wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="246">And it wasn't so bad "til on a Friday in 1942, it must have been like September, when Amon Goeth took over that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">In the first, it was on a Friday morning - I will never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="248">When he took over that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, they took us from that place--it was called "appellplatz"--the place that they count us. </sentence><sentence id="249">Every day, they count us like we would be worth a fortune. </sentence><sentence id="250">And...and in that moment, Goeth took out...There was, we was run by Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="251">The SS was on the outside, and inside in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was only a few SS people. </sentence><sentence id="252">But most was run by <span class="building">Jewish police</span>, and Jewish kapos. </sentence><sentence id="253">So they took out, he took out the leader from the Jewish police, Katz, and his second his in command, Goldberg, and they shot them both on the spot, Katz and Goldberg. </sentence><sentence id="254">So I start seeing the brutality of Amon Goeth, and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not going to obey, if you're not going to work diligently, so in that time I I saw that we are in for a lot a lot of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="255">In the meantime at <span class="building">home</span>, in 1942 after the high holidays, they found out there were people hiding and they would start cleaning up when they had finished the big <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">The smaller <span class="populated place">cities</span>, they start going to the <span class="region">outskirts</span>, and my father saw from far away that some Germans are coming with some, that some people, there's a lot of horses and <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, there's a lot of things going on, so he pushed out from the <span class="building">house</span> a brother right after me and another one and and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="257">They pushed them out from the <span class="building">house</span>, and he said tun. </sentence><sentence id="258">So they run into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">They knew their way to go into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so they run into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">My father and mother and the youngest sister and the youngest brother, they took to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Miechow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">And in <span class="populated place">Miechow</span>, they had at that time maybe eighty or ninety Jews altogether. </sentence><sentence id="262">So they asked the men to stay on one side, and the women and children on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="263">They didn't know what they're going to do, but my father will not have it. </sentence><sentence id="264">He said, "I will not leave my wife or with two children. </sentence><sentence id="265">Whatever will happen to her, will happen to me." </sentence><sentence id="266">They took the men out in the side and they asked one, always will ask the the commander, what should we do with them. </sentence><sentence id="267">So they said, "It's not enough people to make a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">Shoot them on the spot." </sentence><sentence id="269">And they killed my father and mother. </sentence><sentence id="270">One was holding one child in the hand and one was holding the other child in the hand. </sentence><sentence id="271">I know it for a fact, because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and they were crying like little babies, that they left their family. </sentence><sentence id="272">They felt the guilt. </sentence><sentence id="273">It was the murderers who put them to that position. </sentence><sentence id="274">Because after all, we are taught that life is so  precious, that life with force you are born and with force you must die. </sentence><sentence id="275">You cannot take your own life, that life by Jewish people is very precious. </sentence><sentence id="276">But they knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="277">They knew my mother. </sentence><sentence id="278">And that was the beginning of that I lost my father and mother and a brother and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="279">And in the meantime, I was with my older brother in <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">P_aszow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">In 194...and I building <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">We were building <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">We were building <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">It was, we were in two different groups. </sentence><sentence id="284">They normally separated so first we were in one group but then we were in separate groups. </sentence><sentence id="285">Every group had fifty peo...boys. </sentence><sentence id="286">And with fifty boys went a <span class="building">Jewish kapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">In 1943, in March, beginning of March, they liquidated <span class="populated place">Krakow ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">My two brothers and sister did not have papers. </sentence><sentence id="289">They they were not legally in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so they hide. </sentence><sentence id="290">They hid and they liquidated the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on a Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="291">I think it was March llth. </sentence><sentence id="292">And by Wednesday, and they brought in all the people. </sentence><sentence id="293">And one occasion I I will forget that - the women were coming out and one woman had in her knapsack a little baby. </sentence><sentence id="294">And the little baby was crying, and the German heard...heard the baby crying, and he killed the baby and the mother on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="295">Shot them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="296">And our group from were taken to right on Sunday they start cleaning out those people who had no papers and those people who were hide, they were bringing up to <span class="populated place">P_aszow</span>, and we, the boys, had to take them down - some of them were complete dead, some was not dead - in one case I saw a girl, a young child that wasn't dead, and we asked the German give the girl, give her ,aaa  "If you sleeping in during the winter in that uh snow outside, you must be Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="297">So he knew the prayers of uh the Catholic prayers as as better than any Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="298">And he said the prayers in front of him, but nothing helped him. </sentence><sentence id="299">And he received an award for that, twelve pounds--that's five kilo--sugar. </sentence><sentence id="300">For every time you gave out a Jew in <span class="country">Poland</span>, you got a reward of five kilo sugar. </sentence><sentence id="301">I know it for a fact, because after the war I came to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> and people told me that. </sentence><sentence id="302">And I asked him to testify. </sentence><sentence id="303">He said, "There's no use of testifying. </sentence><sentence id="304">The man ran away." </sentence><sentence id="305">I'm positive surely he did not run away. </sentence><sentence id="306">But I didn't know who the man was, and I couldn't bring him to any justice. </sentence><sentence id="307">I was left with my brother in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">In 1943, about...it could have been in August or September - it was already chilly a little bit - 1 worked in [the] <span class="building">Barrackenbau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were fifty boys. </sentence><sentence id="310">And to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> came in a new commander in chief. </sentence><sentence id="311">His name was Frank (ph) and Amon Goeth tried to be friendly with him. </sentence><sentence id="312">So he took out all our fifty boys with, we loaded up loads of topsoil on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we went near <span class="populated place">Krakovia</span> (ph) place. </sentence><sentence id="313">There was a big beautiful <span class="building">villa</span> and we made a <span class="dlf">garden</span> for Frank. </sentence><sentence id="314">While we maked the <span class="dlf">garden</span> on our way <span class="building">home</span>, one of the boys escaped and when we got in we were forty-nine and our kapo. </sentence><sentence id="315">And the kapo didn't notice it that he escaped, so he started beating us over the head with his stick, the night stick that the policeman carries, and they wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="316">They waited until Goeth comes down from his <span class="building">villa</span>, and Goeth came in and he said, where's the fiftieth? </sentence><sentence id="317">We all say we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="318">We didn't even know him we said. </sentence><sentence id="319">Maybe we only went out forty-nine. </sentence><sentence id="320">So he said for that that one escape, he shot every second boy. </sentence><sentence id="321">A boy was shot next to me, to my right, and a boy was shot on the left of me. </sentence><sentence id="322">I cannot recall if it was twenty-four or twenty-five, but all we were left is half of our group. </sentence><sentence id="323">The other half of our group was shot right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="324">I saw it will be impossible to live and to be in the <span class="building">Barrackenbau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was the worst work and was working outside and I, maybe I learned like the animal the necessity of survive. </sentence><sentence id="326">I recognize Goeth when he's ready to shoot people. </sentence><sentence id="327">He will have with him that the instinct of an animal. </sentence><sentence id="328">He would not eat his breakfast or sometimes lunch unless he saw Jewish blood. </sentence><sentence id="329">And he will wear three different hats. </sentence><sentence id="330">The officer's hat, the plain soldier's hat and a <span class="country">Tyrol</span> like when you go <span class="spatial object">yacht</span> (ph), uh a <span class="country">Tyrol</span> hat. </sentence><sentence id="331">That <span class="spatial object">Tyrol hat</span> was the most dangerous hat. </sentence><sentence id="332">And by the way, Amon Goeth was an Austrian, and he was called in 1946 and people testified and they hanged him in <span class="country">Poland</span>, uh <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">So when he would go in with this hat, I would always sneak away, because regardless if you work hard or not, whenever it was convenient for him, for no reason at all, he'd while he was riding his horse, from the horse he will shoot, or even while he was walking. </sentence><sentence id="334">He will go over, behind the ear - that was his specialty. </sentence><sentence id="335">Go over to a man, behind his ear shoot him, and then scream and yell, then go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">People testified and he was saying now you can give me my lunch or my breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="337">So it was, being in the <span class="building">Barakenbau</span> (ph) was almost unbear...unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="338">So at night, after everybody finished their work at six o'clock, instead of going back to my <span class="building">barracks</span> to relax, I would go to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> I would chop wood for the people who work in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">I will also wash for them their <span class="spatial object">kettles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">And I did a good job at it. </sentence><sentence id="341">And once I caught the eye of the SS man, and he said why are you working here. </sentence><sentence id="342">You're not working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, cause I was shabby dressed. </sentence><sentence id="343">And I said I need food. </sentence><sentence id="344">I'm hungry. </sentence><sentence id="345">So he said, for you working so hard and I chopped the wood very good and I washed the <span class="spatial object">kettles</span> good, when we will enlarge, they kept constantly enlarging that <span class="populated place">camp</span> from ten thousand to twenty thousand, there were the people to come from  0 was assigned by the Jewish police, so one morning I was called in to get a <span class="spatial object">kettle</span> in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>, in in the in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a <span class="spatial object">kettle</span> in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">And the Jewish policeman said, we didn't send you there. </sentence><sentence id="347">So the German said, I gave it to him. </sentence><sentence id="348">If he wouldn't say the word, I gave it to him, they would probably beat me. </sentence><sentence id="349">I thought they would probably kill me by beating me, so that was like the end of 1943, and my working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, I had the opportunity to help myself, help my other friends and especially help my elder brother. </sentence><sentence id="350">And that was from 1944 in May - it was Mother's Day. </sentence><sentence id="351">They , Mutter, Mutter (ph), and Mengele came to our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352"> 1 least did not see any <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">It was a <span class="populated place">transit camp</span> of five days was the most that they would let you stay in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">They complete undress you. </sentence><sentence id="355">You couldn't have nothing that belongs to you. </sentence><sentence id="356">They make you spread your your legs and and check, cut off your hair. </sentence><sentence id="357">Nothing that could belong to you that you could have it. </sentence><sentence id="358">All you got is uh pair of pants - no underwear, a shirt, a cap and a jacket and a pair of wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="359">That was, and a number on the things. </sentence><sentence id="360">That's all, and for five days if somebody from the SS called that a <span class="building">factory</span> needs a hundred people, five hundred people, a thousand people, then no no question was it, then they shipped them out there. </sentence><sentence id="361">If after five days nobody called you, dead. </sentence><sentence id="362">The first day we came in, they gave us <span class="interior space">showers</span> and we didn't know if we going to get gas or we're going to get water. </sentence><sentence id="363">We knew already about it, it was on under they had a that under <span class="dlf">doorway</span>, on the <span class="dlf">doors</span> that you walked into <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>, it said in German, here you enter, and then there was a big <span class="dlf">chimney</span> and it says on the big <span class="dlf">chimney</span>, and over there you go now. </sentence><sentence id="364">It's supposed to be a <span class="populated place">political camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">We sat in crutches (ph). </sentence><sentence id="366">Inside on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, spread our legs and one was sitting right into the other. </sentence><sentence id="367">If one, and we were so packed if one had to sneeze or move, everybody had to move. </sentence><sentence id="368">Like glued in like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="369">And we were taken to a doctor, and the five days, I saw truckloads of young Poles who tried to take over <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, make an , and they were taken and they immediately were given gas. </sentence><sentence id="370">Young, eighteen, twenty years old. </sentence><sentence id="371">And everybody was saying that the same thing works for us. </sentence><sentence id="372">The fourth or the fifth night they were saying that Oskar Schindler came to <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span> with a list, and that people are on the list, and when I heard my name called out, Murray Pantirer, Moses Pantirer, sheet metal worker. </sentence><sentence id="373">Until this day I have no idea who put me there because to be, everybody knew that they making lists. </sentence><sentence id="374">People were promising, there was, the list was made with Schindler and also Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish policeman. </sentence><sentence id="375">People promised Marcel Goldberg diamonds, <span class="building">houses</span> that after the war they will assign. </sentence><sentence id="376">I had nothing to give. </sentence><sentence id="377">Was a very poor boy. </sentence><sentence id="378">And almost everybody was poor. </sentence><sentence id="379">What, at least some of it had maybe some belongings that they hid some place. </sentence><sentence id="380">I had no belongings I hid no place. </sentence><sentence id="381">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="382">And to have my name in it, if 1 would be a kind of fanatic, I would say an angel flew down from heaven and wrote down my name. </sentence><sentence id="383">Maybe it meant to be that at least one of our Pantirer (crying) should survive. </sentence><sentence id="384">In October, the fifth day, they put us on <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and I want to bring out a very important point right now. </sentence><sentence id="385">The Germans claimed that they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="386">We knew, when we were walking from, to the <span class="building">train station</span>, when we were in <span class="country">Germany</span> we were pelted with stones and we called S Juden (ph). </sentence><sentence id="387">When we passed only from  2 TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: OK, <span class="populated place">Murray</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">We're back on tape. </sentence><sentence id="650">Tell us what happened to you after you were put on Schindler's list. </sentence><sentence id="651">Where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: I was called out in <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span> among other people. </sentence><sentence id="657">They give us some food and they put us on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but we were all very excited because uh we knew that if Oskar Schindler came and brought in a list that somehow there's an opportunity of survival, that we may be able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="658">We knew that uh <span class="country">Poland</span> was all occupied, almost occupied by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="659">We knew that the Allied forces are doing good in Europe and <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Italy</span>, so to us it was like a a new lease on life. </sentence><sentence id="660">The .... (ph), uh maybe it wasn't convenient but there's nothing what to complain about because we knew we're going to <span class="populated place">Brnenc</span>. </sentence><sentence id="661">We came to <span class="populated place">Bmenc</span>. </sentence><sentence id="662">It was a different situation. </sentence><sentence id="663">Was a few SS people. </sentence><sentence id="664">There were no <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">There was an old <span class="building">factory</span>, and we're supposed to fix up that <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="666">And Oskar Schindler was not happy that he took out eight or nine hundred Jews from <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">He went a few weeks later to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and got out three hundred women, and he said in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> that he needs them to work. </sentence><sentence id="668">I can testify to you the only thing I saw them doing is getting wool and knit sweaters for their husbands or boyfriends or friends or socks or gloves. </sentence><sentence id="669">Very little work did they do. </sentence><sentence id="670">As a matter of fact we all did very little work. </sentence><sentence id="671">We always was scared that something's going to happen that he will be called, because we did not produce a single piece of ammunition, not a single piece. </sentence><sentence id="672">Once we were told that he bought a <span class="spatial object">car</span> load of ammunition from another <span class="building">factory</span> and delivered that it is from our <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">Once we were told that he kept saying, Oh, I'm almost almost there. </sentence><sentence id="674">And I have to, and he alwa...he welcomed us and he said, you are the Schindler's Juden, and here you will survive. </sentence><sentence id="675">Nothing going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="676">And I was assigned to work in the <span class="region">areas</span> where the Ger...the SS were living in their <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="677">And I shined their shoes, so I always had a little extra piece of bread, had a piece of cigarette from the ends uh that I could come to <span class="populated place">camp</span> and always share it, exchange it for a piece of bread because people looked for the cigarette even if they were hungry, they gave you a piece of bread to have that cigarette, because they were they were addicted to the cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="678">I didn't smoke. </sentence><sentence id="679">I was young, and I would do some work in Schindler's own <span class="building">house</span>, so I had uh a matter of fact I could say that I walked out from <span class="populated place">camp</span> a healthy boy. </sentence><sentence id="680">I never had uh those uh boils on my body and somehow I, how it happened I don't know but I have to give you a a story. </sentence><sentence id="681">In February of 1944, "45, a call came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that on a <span class="dlf">siding</span> not far from our <span class="populated place">camp</span> the Germans left carloads of people just to die. </sentence><sentence id="682">They need the <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span>, that's the <span class="spatial object">engines</span>, they needed for their own use. </sentence><sentence id="683">And the Czech who worked on the <span class="dlf">siding</span>, on the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, asked his superior to call in to our <span class="populated place">camp</span> that people are just laying there and dying, if our <span class="populated place">camp</span> will accept them. </sentence><sentence id="684">And Oskar Schindler and his wife said yes, they will accept. </sentence><sentence id="685">They accept. </sentence><sentence id="686">That was mostly Hungarian Jews, and they brought us, brought them into our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">They they send out an <span class="spatial object">engine</span> from our <span class="populated place">camp</span> because we had an <span class="spatial object">engine</span> and it brought in, and I was among some young boys  3 shoulders and the other grabbed him by, and I grabbed him by the feet, and they were so frozen their behind that we ripped their skins. </sentence><sentence id="688">And the screaming was unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="689">So what we did we worked slowly, and we worked like almost impossible task. </sentence><sentence id="690">If we hold our fingers, if we put too hot water we will burn them. </sentence><sentence id="691">Too cold <span class="env feature">water</span>, it didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="692">So we had to try to, and lift them up, and we lift up maybe about twenty-eight or thirty young men like skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="693">And we took them into our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and Mrs. Schindler was cooking cereal for them every day. </sentence><sentence id="694">They were in a separate <span class="building">barrack</span>, cause the stink from them, the smell was just unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="695">And she would ask one of our boys, sometimes myself, to carry in the food and you had to feed them. </sentence><sentence id="696">And out of the twenty-eight a few people have died and a few walked out. </sentence><sentence id="697">I was on a gathering for the <span class="building">Yad Vashem</span> to <span class="populated place">valey</span> (ph) that we <span class="building">building</span> now three years ago, and a man walked over to me and he said, are you Murray Pantirer? </sentence><sentence id="698">I live in <span class="region">Long Island</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">You are the one who pulled me from this <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">So not only he didn't kill people, he has on his, he and his wife were the real righteous people that they help anybody they could have helped to.
