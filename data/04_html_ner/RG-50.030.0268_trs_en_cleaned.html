<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q:Morning. </sentence><sentence id="2">Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A:My name is William Dowdell Denson. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in <span class="populated place">Birmingham</span>, <span class="region">Alabama</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q:And can you tell us a bit about your education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Well, I was actually educated in the <span class="building">public schools</span> of <span class="populated place">Birmingham</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States <span class="building">military academy</span> at <span class="building">West Point</span>, <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty-four. </sentence><sentence id="14">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span>, which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937. </sentence><sentence id="15">That is the basis of my undoing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q:And how come you got interested in the law? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Well, I guess that was kind of natural. </sentence><sentence id="24">My great-grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty-five and continued there until <span class="populated place">Alabama</span> succeeded from the Union. </sentence><sentence id="25">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of <span class="populated place">Vicksburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much. </sentence><sentence id="27">On my -- his son, rather, would go back -- take the <span class="region">maternal side</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="28">My great-grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell. </sentence><sentence id="29">He also was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="30">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the <span class="building">supreme court</span> of Alabama which is the highest judicial court of that state. </sentence><sentence id="31">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the <span class="building">house</span>, and he, of course, was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="32">And his father was a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="33">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="34"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection congressman and the United States attorney for the <span class="region">northern district</span> of <span class="region">Alabama</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q:And going to <span class="populated place">West Point</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: went to <span class="populated place">West Point</span> in -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q:Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A:Excuse me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q:Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A:I went to <span class="populated place">West Point</span> back after I graduated both from <span class="building">Harvard</span> and from the <span class="building">military academy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">I went back to <span class="populated place">West Point</span> to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five, at which time I was ordered to join the <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I joined them in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="65">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the <span class="building">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at <span class="populated place">West Point</span> from "42 until "45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q:Can we go back just a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="73"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="74">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="75"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q:When you were at <span class="building">Harvard</span>, the Nazis had taken over in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">And when you were at <span class="building">Harvard</span> in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="80">Was there any discussion at <span class="building">Harvard</span> about what was going on in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> that you can remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A:No, sir. </sentence><sentence id="85">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned. </sentence><sentence id="86">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="87">And nothing -- I knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="88">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of. </sentence><sentence id="89">But there was never any teaching at <span class="building">Harvard</span> about the Nuremberg Laws at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q:When did you first become aware of oppression in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A:To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="99">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, if I'm not mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="100">At that time the pogroms had started. </sentence><sentence id="101">And actually they started even before then. </sentence><sentence id="102">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on. </sentence><sentence id="103">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in <span class="building">grammar school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span> and in <span class="populated place">West Point</span> and at <span class="building">Harvard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">So it was -- it came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place. </sentence><sentence id="105">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="106">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="107"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q:Did you know anything about the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span> that had been coming from Europe to <span class="country">Cuba</span> and was not let -- people were not let into <span class="country">Cuba</span> and then they weren't let in the <span class="country">United States</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="121">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter. </sentence><sentence id="122">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q:So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A:<span class="dlf">lt</span> was negligible. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I knew even less about communism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:So tell me, did you want this job in the <span class="building">judge advocate's office</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain. </sentence><sentence id="135">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q:But you didn't know what you were getting into? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="140"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="141">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="142"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: certainly did not. </sentence><sentence id="144">I would do it again, though. </sentence><sentence id="145">Even now that I know it. </sentence><sentence id="146">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="147">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q:When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A:Well, in <span class="building">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops. </sentence><sentence id="156">And that was true in all of the <span class="building">combat units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them. </sentence><sentence id="158">And some of those things drifted into the <span class="building">Headquarters of 3rd Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">And our judge advocate -- I mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph). </sentence><sentence id="160">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time. </sentence><sentence id="161">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell. </sentence><sentence id="162">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations. </sentence><sentence id="163">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="164">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q:So you learned something before you went to <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A:No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="178">May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was in <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="180">I went over to <span class="country">Germany</span>, I went to <span class="building">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="181">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> at the rear echelon of <span class="building">Headquarters 3rd Amny</span> was stationed in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="183">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="184"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q:Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A:Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty-five. </sentence><sentence id="198">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in <span class="building">Headquarters 3rd Army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">Patton was the commanding general at that time. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the teams that would be actually at <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> was just 17 kilometers west of <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">And at that time we were conscious of what was -- had gone along at <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't actually visit the <span class="populated place">camp</span> until I think some time in July of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="203">Our <span class="building">headquarters</span> were in the-- what they call the <span class="building">house</span> of in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">And 17 kilometers  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And at first there was sort of attitude that this -- some of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports. </sentence><sentence id="205">But that of course is in jest. </sentence><sentence id="206">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all. </sentence><sentence id="207">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q:There were a number of lawyers with you? </sentence><sentence id="221">About 30 lawyers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A:In the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q:That were working with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A:At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the <span class="interior space">judge advocate's section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were. </sentence><sentence id="230">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40-, 50-odd individuals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q:Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in? </sentence><sentence id="235">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A:Well, I'm sure that they were. </sentence><sentence id="239">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it. </sentence><sentence id="240">It was a credible matter This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="241">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="242"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to them. </sentence><sentence id="243">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter. </sentence><sentence id="244">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testimony that could be believed. </sentence><sentence id="245">Because of it's nature. </sentence><sentence id="246">Not that it wasn't true; it was true. </sentence><sentence id="247">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="248">That's the only way to describe it. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I was a skeptic. </sentence><sentence id="250">I didn't believe it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="251">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the <span class="populated place">Dachau concentration camp</span> case. </sentence><sentence id="252">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of <span class="dlf">line</span>, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="253">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it. </sentence><sentence id="254">In all of these <span class="populated place">camps</span> there was place in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> called the <span class="building">arrest bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">And in the <span class="building">arrest bunker</span> there was some <span class="interior space">cells</span> which were called the <span class="interior space">standing cells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible for -- almost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these <span class="interior space">cells</span> to either lie down or to sit. </sentence><sentence id="257">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">And these $.S. men who were in charge of the <span class="interior space">arrest bunker</span> would put prisoners in there for punishment. </sentence><sentence id="259">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days. </sentence><sentence id="260">And sometimes longer if they lived that long. </sentence><sentence id="261">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out. </sentence><sentence id="262">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">And on that <span class="spatial object">table</span> would be a <span class="spatial object">vessel</span> with two or more liters of water in it. </sentence><sentence id="264">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately. </sentence><sentence id="265">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out. </sentence><sentence id="266">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach. </sentence><sentence id="267">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the <span class="dlf">walls</span> of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death. </sentence><sentence id="268">Now, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="269">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="270"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="271">It was one of the things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="272">And it happened not only in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, which was the case I was concerned with at that time, but in <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, <span class="populated place">Flossenbiirg</span> and <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q:Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q:What caused you not to become skeptical? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A:Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="328">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall. </sentence><sentence id="329">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove-tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you. </sentence><sentence id="330">And because they dove-tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened. </sentence><sentence id="331">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct. </sentence><sentence id="332">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place. </sentence><sentence id="333">Nevertheless, when somebody from <span class="country">Poland</span> gave me that type of story, another witness from <span class="country">France</span> the same thing, another from <span class="country">Belgium</span>, I began to believe. </sentence><sentence id="334">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen. </sentence><sentence id="335">That was the thing that made a believer out of me. </sentence><sentence id="336">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with. </sentence><sentence id="337">What <span class="building">court</span> now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 a horrible event. </sentence><sentence id="340">Who's going to believe that? </sentence><sentence id="341">You didn't. </sentence><sentence id="342">And it's only natural that the members of the <span class="building">court</span> wouldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="343">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the <span class="building">court</span> in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a <span class="dlf">penal environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">Slapping around. </sentence><sentence id="345">Little more force; knocking around. </sentence><sentence id="346">Down to beatings. </sentence><sentence id="347">In that various degrees. </sentence><sentence id="348">And in that way it conditioned the <span class="building">court</span> for the bizarre events that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="349">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel. </sentence><sentence id="350">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men. </sentence><sentence id="351">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the <span class="building">court</span> so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place. </sentence><sentence id="352">And it seemed to work. </sentence><sentence id="353">The <span class="building">court</span> in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="354">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed. </sentence><sentence id="355">We almost hit the jackpot in the <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> case. </sentence><sentence id="356">In that case we had 61 accused in the <span class="dlf">dock</span> that we were trying. </sentence><sentence id="357">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="358">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. </sentence><sentence id="359">So that was almost the jackpot. </sentence><sentence id="360">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q:Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="933">Q:Bill, could you describe the atmosphere at the <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> trials and what that was like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A:Well, let me say this: That the <span class="building">courtroom</span> had been one of the <span class="building">buildings</span> in which operations in support of the war had taken place. </sentence><sentence id="936">True it is, they were making shoes and uniforms for the Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="937">And they had the necessary <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> in there for sewing and mending and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="938">Well, when they decided to have these trials down in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, they ripped out all the insides of this <span class="building">building</span> that I just described so that there was one large <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">And it was so large that it was the size of the whole <span class="building">building</span>, which could have been 200-250 feet long and maybe a hundred feet wide. </sentence><sentence id="940">And they made <span class="building">offices</span> for the prosecution and <span class="building">offices</span> for the defendants. </sentence><sentence id="941">And one end of the -- accused in one end of the <span class="building">building</span>, another end of the <span class="building">building</span> was the <span class="building">courtroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="942">And at the far end was a <span class="spatial object">dais</span> that was raised about two feet off of the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="943">So you had to take really two steps to get up to where you could stand. </sentence><sentence id="944">And there was a <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, you called it. </sentence><sentence id="945">What we call -- lawyers call <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="946">The <span class="spatial object">judges" bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="947">It was his <span class="spatial object">desk</span> actually. </sentence><sentence id="948">It was a <span class="spatial

chairs</span> were placed. </sentence><sentence id="950">And it would seat up on the <span class="spatial object">dais</span> approximately as many as 12 to 13 people. </sentence><sentence id="951">So it was adequate. </sentence><sentence id="952">And being elevated, it was high enough to command respect. </sentence><sentence id="953">That's the whole idea of having the judge on the <span

class="building">court</span> as the <span class="building">court</span> wanted. </sentence><sentence id="962">The accused had nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="963">They occupied <span class="spatial object">seats</span> which were like <span class="spatial object">seats</span> in a <span class="building">theater</span> that didn't have the upholstery. </sentence><sentence id="964">They were <span class="spatial object">seats</span> -- <span class="spatial object">seat</span> of the <span class="spatial object">seat</span> folded up. </sentence><sentence id="965">And they sat on -- the accused in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> sat on the <span class="building">court</span>'s left in that case. </sentence><sentence id="966">In <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> they started out on the left and moved over to the right. </sentence><sentence id="967">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the <span class="building">court</span> one day and it was that way, so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="968">And the accused each had their own separate <span class="interior space">seat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="969">And in front of the <span class="building">bank</span> of accused that was seated there were the <span class="spatial object">counsel table</span> for the accused. </sentence><sentence id="970">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them. </sentence><sentence id="971">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">We had no instantaneous translation. </sentence><sentence id="973">We had -- the trials were conducted in English and in German basically. </sentence><sentence id="974">So we had an English and German interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="975">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English-Polish, German-Polish interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="976">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English. </sentence><sentence id="977">That was then translated by the English-German interpreter into German. </sentence><sentence id="978">Then the Polish-English interpreter would ask the question to the witness. </sentence><sentence id="979">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it. </sentence><sentence id="980">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply. </sentence><sentence id="981">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English-German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish. </sentence><sentence id="982">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="983">So it was sometimes kind of confusing. </sentence><sentence id="984">But the <span class="building">court</span> had the official -- these interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters. </sentence><sentence id="985">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel. </sentence><sentence id="986">So there was a <span class="building">bank</span> of people. </sentence><sentence id="987">We were never without people. </sentence><sentence id="988">We always had enough accused for an audience at all This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="989">It is not the primary source, and it has

</sentence><sentence id="991">But the rest of the <span class="spatial object">seating</span> in that covered enough <span class="interior space">rows</span> there to seat approximately 250 to 300 attendees. </sentence><sentence id="992">And as I said, when we started out we had <span class="interior space">standing room</span> only at sentencing. </sentence><sentence id="993">And when <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> was not sitting, when <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us. </sentence><sentence id="994">And the attendees were basically in that only the families of the accused were there but also there were representatives of the different nationals that were involved. </sentence><sentence id="995">We had no Russian observers. </sentence><sentence id="996">We had no Polish observers, except the <span class="populated place">London</span> Poles. </sentence><sentence id="997">The <span class="populated place">London</span> Poles sent observers, and they were religious about attending all the trials. </sentence><sentence id="998">When <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> finished, then the court reporters all -- the newspaper reporters all came back and flocked in. </sentence><sentence id="999">And at that time they had been broadcasting these proceedings over the <span class="building">Munich radio station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up. </sentence><sentence id="1001">We had a lot more attendees that wanted to see what they were hearing. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Because some of it was still incredible to most of them, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="1003">But when they saw the witnesses and heard them testify, they began to believe also. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And the attitude, although I must say it was hard to determine, there never was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="1005">It was always carried out on a dignified <span class="spatial object">plane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1006">But sometimes there would be laughter at some activities that had occurred. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And when some of the interpreters got fouled up, everybody was amused at that. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Well, we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams. </sentence><sentence id="1316">And recognizing we had to have witnesses that were credible and we had to have witnesses that were knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Those were the two things that were fundamental: Credibility and knowledgeability. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And we would take the information that we got from the war crimes teams and use that as springboards. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And interrogating witnesses, we would go from one witness to another depending upon what sort of impression he would make on the <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1320">We evaluated that. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And he may have known of an event that had occurred that others who would have more credibility than he had. </sentence><sentence id="1322">So we would look around for that. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And in this search we -- I was allocated a <span class="building">DC-3</span> in which to collect the witnesses from all over <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Of course, as you know, the inmates of these four <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> came from practically every spot in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And so those were the sites of the witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="1326">Because most of them that had <span class="building">homes</span> to go <span class="building">home</span> to went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1327">A lot of them remained in the <span class="populated place">D.P. camps</span>; <span class="populated place">displaced persons camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1328">That was a fertile source for acquiring witnesses, also. </sentence><sentence id="1329">But we would get these witnesses in, and they would tell us these stories. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And we would make an evaluation as to their credibility and their knowledgeability. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Best ones we kept. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Of course, we couldn't run on forever. </sentence><sentence id="1333">But we tried to get the best because we would listen to one and he would tell us about somebody else that knew the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And we would try to track him down. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And I'm -- I've got to tell you about a man that assisted us greatly in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1336">His name was Kohl, K-o-h-l.

id="1340">But he had a <span class="interior space">mouth</span> full of gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And the Germans had an affinity for gold wherever it was; and particularly for those prisoners who had gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1342">So that many a man lost his life because he had gold teeth in his <span class="dlf">mouth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Well, when I met Mr. Kohl in the process of trying to get witnesses from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> for the Mauthausen trial, he opened his mouth and laughed and there was this expanse of gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Just like a sunburst. </sentence><sentence id="1345">I said, "Mr. Kohl, how in heaven's name did you survive <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> from nineteen hundred and thirty-eight when you were incarcerated there until the liberation in nineteen hundred and forty-five in April?" </sentence><sentence id="1346">And he says, "Colonel, I never smiled. </sentence><sentence id="1347">And when J ate, I never chewed with my mouth open." </sentence><sentence id="1348">And he survived. </sentence><sentence id="1349">So I'm sure that's what he did to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Because when he did smile, as I said, it was daybreak, and it was lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1351">But getting witnesses out of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1352">They had a staff judge advocate over in <span class="building">7th Army</span> there at <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> because <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> was in the <span class="region">Russian zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1353">The only part of <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> that we had access to was the principal part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and <span class="building">Tulin (ph) Air Force Base</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And that was -- otherwise you had to go through the <span class="region">Russian zone</span> from <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span> to get down to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Well, the staff judge advocate there under General Mark Clark said, "You can't take these witness out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1356">The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the <span class="region">Russian Zone</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1357">And I asked to see General Clark, and I went in and I spoke to him. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And he was a very cooperative individual. </sentence><sentence id="1359">He said, "Colonel, you don't have to take them all out at one time, do you?" </sentence><sentence id="1360">And I said, "No, sir." </sentence><sentence id="1361">And he said, "Will five at the most do?" </sentence><sentence id="1362">And "Yes, sir," I said, "We can shuttle them back and forth from now on." </sentence><sentence id="1363">We only had about 30 that we had to get out so it wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1364">But we had that type of reticence that was really keeping us from preparing <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Because <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> was located on the <span class="env feature">Enns River</span> near <span class="populated place">Linz</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And most of those individuals who were the occupants of <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> were Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And they had come from around <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1368">As a matter of fact, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

get these witnesses out. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And Mister Kohl was the man that did it with his gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1373">He had a card index there of addresses of the people, I'm sure all of them were communists. </sentence><sentence id="1374">But Lord bless them. </sentence><sentence id="1375">At that time, and I must confess, at that time I didn't know a communist from a Nazi, or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1376">They were all individuals to me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And they were trying to assist me in discharging my duties. </sentence><sentence id="1378">So I was very happy to have Mr. Kohl come in and testify and exhibit his gold teeth at the trial. </sentence><sentence id="1379">Although I must say, it shook his credibility a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1380">But when he pressed his lips over his teeth, it made quite an impression on the <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1381">And they were human beings, the <span class="building">courts</span> were. </sentence><sentence id="1382">They had a reason to believe that Mr.Kohl was telling the truth and that he did keep his mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And it was something that was terribly impressive to me that an individual could control his muscles to the extent that -- I guess when your life is involved, you can do many things. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And Kohl did it. </sentence><sentence id="1385">Well, I guess I was wandering here about the witnesses that we had, and the problems that we had. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I guess <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> posed the most serious problem because most of the witnesses that knew the most were from that <span class="region">area</span> around <span class="populated place">Linz</span> and <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Now, we did get a lot of witnesses out of the <span class="populated place">D.P. camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Because those are the people that had no <span class="building">homes</span> to go back to. </sentence><sentence

id="1391">They had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So they were in these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And we took those people.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1482">Q:Can I ask you to describe what credibility and knowledgeability meant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Credibility involves many things. </sentence><sentence id="1486">The way that you sit in your <span class="spatial object">chair</span> on the <span class="interior space">witness stand</span>, your demeanor on the <span class="interior space">witness stand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1487">How you express yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1488">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1489">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact-finders to tell where the truth lies. </sentence><sentence id="1490">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it. </sentence><sentence id="1491">It comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact-finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime. </sentence><sentence id="1494">But credibility is terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the <span class="building">court</span> to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And if you had had a closed-mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1497">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact-finder is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1498">That's what I mean about credibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1516">A:Well, the only reluctance I think they had was recalling again the experiences that they had endured. </sentence><sentence id="1517">I don't think anybody was afraid to testify. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I don't think there was any coercion of any kind of character, either pro or con in that <span class="region">area</span>.

been snatched away from <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and put into a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>". </sentence><sentence id="1526">And he was a learned individual. </sentence><sentence id="1527">Dignified man. </sentence><sentence id="1528">And one night while he was in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, I think it was in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> that he was incarcerated in, he was so hungry he couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1529">And that had occurred not once but many times. </sentence><sentence id="1530">But this time it was terribly painful for him. </sentence><sentence id="1531">And he remembered a crust of bread that his fellow prisoner had tucked under his arm to safeguard and eat it at some time. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And he found himself easing - stealing, if you please - that piece of bread from his fellow prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And he took it back to his <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1534">And then he started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="1535">To think that he had sunk so low due to the treatment that he had been receiving there at <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, that he would steal from his fellow prisoner, who probably needed it just as badly, if not worse than he did. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Well, needless to say, that crust of bread found its way back to his fellow prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Well, when Brother Halleau delivered himself of that testimony on the stand, you could have heard a pin drop in that <span class="building">courtroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Everybody was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And they were moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1540">I was moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And I think all the judges were moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1542">But that was the type of witness that are few and far between. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But I say few and far between. </sentence><sentence id="1544">Few is the wrong word. </sentence><sentence id="1545">There were multitudes of them. </sentence><sentence id="1546">But not all of them did we have access to. </sentence><sentence id="1547">So they were jewels when we found witnesses like that. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Another one was the name of Yoe-Thomas He was in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1549">A very interesting individual. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And he has since written a book entitled The White Rabbit, which you might get and read. </sentence><sentence id="1551">It was his

they were trying to develop a specific typhus like they were trying to develop one for malaria down at <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And the guinea pigs were the prisoners, and they were dying right and left. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And Yoe-Thomas had served as a liaison between Churchill and DeGaulle. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And he was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And he couldn't spend two successive nights in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1559">The Gestapo were close after him. </sentence><sentence id="1560">They finally caught him and they boxed him up and sent him off to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Broke all his fingers. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Pulled his fingernails out. </sentence><sentence id="1563">Everything you can think of to torture him. </sentence><sentence id="1564">He wouldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And he was sent there with some 20-odd other Britons and Frenchmen. </sentence><sentence id="1566">They had been collected by the Gestapo as being part of the <span class="building">French underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1567">And they were destined to be executed. </sentence><sentence id="1568">So Thomas was a wing commander in the air force of the British. </sentence><sentence id="1569">He was an organizer himself. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And he went to work right away to try to protect his comrades that had been sent to <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1571">Not <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, but <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And they were beginning to get down to where the 20 had gotten down to possibly a half a dozen or more. </sentence><sentence id="1573">And something drastic had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And he talked to Dietzsh who was a prisoner, this male nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And made a deal with Dietzsh to try to get some of these remaining individuals into this sick <span class="dlf">block</span> they had there with typhus being treated, and protect them that way. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And they were changing identities. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Well, one of the prisoners whose identity had matched one of these six men was changed and was just about to die. </sentence><sentence id="1578">And he died, and he was able to swap identity and became a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1579">Well, it finally got down to poor <span class="populated place">Yoe-Thomas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1580">And they found out that Yoe-Thomas was in there, and they said, "Well, bring him out. </sentence><sentence id="1581">We're going to get rid of him." </sentence><sentence id="1582">And the way they had hanged the other, they didn't hang them by breaking the neck. </sentence><sentence id="1583">They strangled them to death. </sentence><sentence id="1584">The <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1702">A:Yes, I would like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1703">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> and was persecuted again by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1704">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one form or another. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnfiihrer, I think they call him. </sentence><sentence id="1707">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And he was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1709">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this <span class="dlf">block</span> which they had set aside as a <span class="dlf">hospital block</span> for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I think it started up in <span class="country">Russia</span>, and <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1713">And as those people spread down <span class="region">south</span>, was sent. </sentence><sentence id="1714">But when the advances forced them out of the <span

poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British-French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally. </sentence><sentence id="1729">And one by one they were able to get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="1730">They finally got down to <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2030">A:Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst. </sentence><sentence id="2031">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self. </sentence><sentence id="2032">That <span class="building">court</span> absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him. </sentence><sentence id="2033">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="2034">Because he had come to this <span class="country">country</span> when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the <span

and to -- actually it wasn't <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2039">It was that section of the <span class="region">Austrian-Hungarian Empire</span> that was in there between <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2040">Actually went back to <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span> and opened a <span class="building">clinic</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2041">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer. </sentence><sentence id="2042">And he was an informer. </sentence><sentence id="2043">And finally he ended up in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2044">And they put him in the small <span class="populated

asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him. </sentence><sentence id="2060">And he had this deep voice. </sentence><sentence id="2061">He could have been a <span

has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish. </sentence><sentence id="2063">And that is that this <span class="building">court</span> impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power." </sentence><sentence id="2064">And he nodded like that. </sentence><sentence id="2065">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart. </sentence><sentence id="2066">I hope they accommodate him. </sentence><sentence id="2067">Well, there was a flurry behind on the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And the president of the <span class="building">court</span> said, "The <span class="building">court</span> finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty. </sentence><sentence id="2069">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment." </sentence><sentence id="2070">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all. </sentence><sentence id="2071">He got off with his life. </sentence><sentence id="2072">And except for his age, he'd be alive today. </sentence><sentence id="2073">But he played it to the last inch. </sentence><sentence id="2074">That <span

imprisonment instead. </sentence><sentence id="2076">So he was a doctor to the end. </sentence><sentence id="2077">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2079">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="2080">There was no clemency that Katzenelenbogen was entitled to, in my judgment. </sentence><sentence id="2081">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority. </sentence><sentence id="2082">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part. </sentence><sentence id="2083">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency. </sentence><sentence id="2085">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety.
