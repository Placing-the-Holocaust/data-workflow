<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: You mentioned in your interview for the <span class="building">Shoah Foundation</span> that British intelligence was superior to American intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="241">Can you clarify that point for me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Yes, I--I went to --I was shipped to <span class="country">England</span> in December of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="245">I was in <span

id="258">He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian. </sentence><sentence id="259">He was dropped into <span class="populated place">Normandy</span> and he sat around painting. </sentence><sentence id="260">He was -- to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to -- <span class="country">Italy</span> was a friendly country. </sentence><sentence id="261">And that's the way he collected intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="262">But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there. </sentence><sentence id="263">He got in by parachute, got -- the French helped him -- <span class="interior space">French underground</span> helped him. </sentence><sentence id="264">And then he -- he sat aro -- he tha -- he started painting and reporting and they had equipment to -- to report. </sentence><sentence id="265">And he was around <span class="region">Normandy</span> and the <span

id="272">And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in- intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the -- with the <span

</sentence><sentence id="274">That was wa-why I said that their -- their intelligence was better, they were better organized. </sentence><sentence id="275">We were just learning, but we got there. </sentence><sentence id="276">We -- just like everything else, I think, in the -- in the U.S. Army. </sentence><sentence id="277">That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="278">Nobody -- there were no real soldiers at th-- in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="279">By 1944 we did the -- the biggest -- biggest job ever done in any -- any invasion. </sentence><sentence id="280">And it was successful. </sentence><sentence id="281">So I guess as Americans, we're -- we're quick learners. </sentence><sentence id="282">We picked up an awful lot from the British. </sentence><sentence id="283">They were very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="284">They taught us then. </sentence><sentence id="285">The <span class="building">schools</span> that I went to in-- in <span class="populated place">London</span> during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us
