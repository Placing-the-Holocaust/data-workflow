<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Of course, they become now the rulers, the mayflowers. </sentence><sentence id="405">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="406">For them -- especially these people who were sitting for months or years. </sentence><sentence id="407">One of them was 20 years sitting in the <span class="building">prisons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">They become the commissars. </sentence><sentence id="409">I remember the commissar was in my grandfather's <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="410">He was still without hair, you know, because in the <span class="building">prisons</span> they have to cut their hair. </sentence><sentence id="411">So he was still very new released from the <span class="building">prison</span> and the government gave them new clothes, mostly leather coats. </sentence><sentence id="412">The commissars, that's the tradition of <span class="country">Soviet Russia</span> from the October revolution and so on and anyway that was the gona (ph), the gona it means it closes. </sentence><sentence id="413">Also, my father didn't wear more his hat and wear a <span class="spatial object">caskette</span> (ph), we call it, like a Stalin hat on his head. </sentence><sentence id="414">That what modern, to be a politaria (ph) man and a socialist and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="415">And I remember also me, in -- when I was in the <span class="building">high school</span>, I have a special uniform, so the uniforms they called it "Habits of the Bourgeoi." </sentence><sentence id="416">No more everybody is wearing what he wants and what you are more closer to the model of <span class="spatial object">study</span> and all the other big shots, such a shirt not too much with a tie. </sentence><sentence id="417">So the people understood that that is more wanted now. </sentence><sentence id="418">So, it was a big change but there were many concerts and the cultural life was very, very intensive. </sentence><sentence id="419">The first time to go to the <span class="building">theater</span> was then for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Because to go into the <span class="building">theater</span> before, it was a problem to get a ticket in the big <span class="building">theater</span> and here in the <span class="building">Yiddish theater</span> I didn't want to go because it was kiche (ph) and I was not  too much involved in the Yiddish culture, except talking Yiddish and reading Jewish newspaper, daily newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="439">In our <span class="populated place">city</span> there were about four newspapers, daily newspapers, in such a small <span class="populated place">city</span> as <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: We were talking the -- about how the Communist groups became much more important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="452">A: It was very natural that they become. </sentence><sentence id="453">It was their time now. </sentence><sentence id="454">People coming from the <span class="interior space">underground</span> to the public. </sentence><sentence id="455">Well, as a members of the Communist party and the people who belong in other ways to this party or to this movement or to this ideology who were before or in <span class="building">prisons</span> or in non-legal situation, they become now big shots, and it was very -- naturally it was very -- everybody could understand it and what happened that some people were far from them, now went to see, maybe one of his family is also between them. </sentence><sentence id="456">Maybe he will be now helped by them, privileged by them, to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="457">It wasn't so easy to get a job, because everybody have to fulfill questionnaires. </sentence><sentence id="458">Who you are, who was your father0, what was your income and so on and to which organizations you did belong and etc. </sentence><sentence id="459">So some people even they were before <span class="building">bourgeoi</span>, what belonged to the so- called <span class="building">bourgeoi</span>, or it was another name. </sentence><sentence id="460">Enemy of the people. </sentence><sentence id="461">Now, if they have a good one of the family who was a Communist and he was not afraid to help them, not afraid, some denied, "Okay you are my cousin, but I know who you are, so please leave me alone." </sentence><sentence id="462">Some of them helped also and what another thing that we have seen many people that were very rich before and not only they were leaved on their places but they became -- they make even a progress, they are promoted. </sentence><sentence id="463">So, we were told that even before they paid contributions to the Communists funds. </sentence><sentence id="464">Or maybe they have them more, maybe they were spies, Idon't know what they were such -- we called them -- how did we call them?Salon (ph) Communists. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: One more question and then I want to move onto the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="480">Yousaid -- your organization became illegal. </sentence><sentence id="481">Did you continue -- did <span class="building">Beitar</span> and some of the other organizations continue but on an underground basis now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="485">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="486">Some of the organizations began to -- no, officially they abolished themselves in order to avoid troubles. </sentence><sentence id="487">They declared -- some of the Zionist groups or even religious groups who were, who were abolished, I think all of them declared officially that they stopped their work, their activity in order to avoid troubles. </sentence><sentence id="488">But bit by bit some of the members who were accustomed to meet every day or every few days together continue to do it, and then somebody gave them an orientation that if you want you can do it, but nobody is responsible for you, do it yourself or you won't. </sentence><sentence id="489">And so they established small <span class="interior space">cells</span> like before the Communists did it, in the near past. </sentence><sentence id="490">So, now the Zionists did it and my organization, my youth movement, Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, I remember that some of  them, some of them were meeting each day -- no, not each day, twice a week maybe, to read Hebrew books. </sentence><sentence id="491">That was activity. </sentence><sentence id="492">Because it's not forbidden, but not fashionable -- it an understatement -- so they did it. </sentence><sentence id="493">When I want to join them, they said, "We are too much, no, go look another place." </sentence><sentence id="494">After that they told me that they were afraid of me. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't know why, maybe because I have some friends who were in the Youth Communist's Party -- movement, youth movement called Consomole (ph). </sentence><sentence id="496">So that they told me afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="497">Anyway, so Idid -- what I did myself in order to express my feelings, afternoon or at night I come to the, to a new -- through this old <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="building">high school</span> and stole Hebrew books and brought them <span class="building">home</span> and I was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="498">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="499">For me it was like I did what I have to do, what I like to do and nobody -- maybe I can be punished for this but only for stealing but not for reading the Hebrew books, because I also, my old Hebrew books that I got for bar mitzvah and other things I -- they were kept. </sentence><sentence id="500">We didn't throw them. </sentence><sentence id="501">I remember also that even the religious was very unpopular and some of us were forced to come to the <span class="building">school</span> Yom Kippur and Pesach, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="502">We tried to keep at <span class="building">home</span> how we could -- and me I was not so happy with that religion in this time. </sentence><sentence id="503">I understand it because that is something of all continuity so I did it also, no too much, but I did it. </sentence><sentence id="504">So I remember Shabbat when our family were together, so sometimes place my father also make Kiddush (ph) and I didn't refuse. </sentence><sentence id="505">What happened at this time -- yes -- I didn't stop to write letters to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="527">Q: You could have gotten in trouble, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: Yes or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="530">It could be. </sentence><sentence id="531">The question how they would comment it, the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="532">Another thing, I also heard the of <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">It was very hard, but it was a technical problem so I remember I wrote to one of my friends of the class, my classmates, his names was Amos Rabinovitz (ph), Amos Rabinovitz, that why you will not tell your authority to make better that we can hear it even in <span class="populated place">Lithuanian Kovno</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: You can probably guess one of the reasons I'm asking you about these youth groups and whether you had to go <span class="interior space">underground</span> and all of that is because later on you were involved in resistance activities, and I'm wondering if any of the tricks you learned, any of the relationships you formed as a boy were important later on. </sentence><sentence id="540">Were a way that you kind of developed that helped you and got you interested in resistance activities later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: Yes, partly, I didn't belong to the <span class="interior space">cells</span> usually which numbered three or four members. </sentence><sentence id="544">I told you why and there was no trouble on this, but I knew and also we knew, all the generations, about <span class="interior space">underground</span> because we were brought up what I told you of Jewish modern history that -- and not only Jewish history but about the socialists or revolutionaries in <span class="country">Russia</span> against the Czar. </sentence><sentence id="545">So, we knew what to do and we saw many films about this, so it was not very new for us. </sentence><sentence id="546">But there were some people who begin at this time to publish a underground newspaper in Hebrew, but that I learned not at this time but in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: Okay, let's -- I want to move ahead a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="552">Do you remember what was happening the  day that <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> was occupied by the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="555">A: <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> was occupied by the Germans not the first day of war, but the third day. </sentence><sentence id="556">It was Tuesday. </sentence><sentence id="557">You know what, I felt a little better because the bombing stopped and we have no special <span class="building">shelters</span> so we were hiding ourselves in -- on the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> between the <span class="interior space">floors</span>, because it was in the middle of a very heavy <span class="building">building</span>, it was the safest place. </sentence><sentence id="558">And you have to run, and here and there. </sentence><sentence id="559">So, first of all was its relaxation, a certain relaxation. </sentence><sentence id="560">We can go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, maybe and we can eat a time more or less that was the first reaction. </sentence><sentence id="561">We knew that we have not to expect good times. </sentence><sentence id="562">That we knew very good from the refugees who came to us and from the newspapers I had also knew not exactly but a lot what they did when they came in <span class="country">Poland</span> a year ago and so on and so on but everybody is thinking that to me it will not come. </sentence><sentence id="563">And I remember that the day before somebody informed us from our <span class="building">house</span> it was my also from my <span class="interior space">classroom</span> his name is Avraham Yashpan (ph).He is now living in <span class="populated place">Rio de Janeiro</span> and told me, "Look, I'm going to escape to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">They will slaughter us." </sentence><sentence id="565">They, it means not only Germans, but everybody except the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="566">We felt that the Lithuanians don't like us, or hate us, better. </sentence><sentence id="567">We felt it, but we didn't know how much. </sentence><sentence id="568">So, I told him I cannot leave my family. </sentence><sentence id="569">Or in other words, so I heard his mother voice through the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, "You see Belle is a better son than you. </sentence><sentence id="570">He's not going to leave his family." </sentence><sentence id="571">Yes, and this woman by the name of Rachael, or Rochel, Rachel Yashpan, she was in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, and I met her after the war near <span class="populated place">Rio de Janeiro</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">She could not come to <span class="country">Palestine</span> for certain reasons. </sentence><sentence id="573">So we were expecting somebody is going to happen, and it happened very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="574">I remember from this only two or three things. </sentence><sentence id="575">One, it come to us, I would call them a gang of five or six people, people from the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">People with guns or with half-guns or something and they took us to the <span class="dlf">back yard</span> -- not the <span class="dlf">back yard</span> but to the -- you know, all the <span class="building">houses</span> were a big place around, so they took us and when we come down, we were living the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>, we show all the Jewish families in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">It means that 90 -- 99 percent except the Gentile are staying in a <span class="dlf">line</span> and the people come to take us are staying against us with guns and we was very frightened, except when he put, one of them, a young guy put his gun against me. </sentence><sentence id="578">So I remember my mother told me, "If you turn now he will not harm you. </sentence><sentence id="579">He knows that you are a good boy." </sentence><sentence id="580">And they told us they had seen the Jewish people are working against the Germans and against the Lithuanian partisans. </sentence><sentence id="581">They called themselves partisans. </sentence><sentence id="582">So, I don't know what happened but we were released to our <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">When we come to the <span class="building">house</span> we have seen that in my daddy's <span class="spatial object">table</span>, he has his own <span class="spatial object">table</span> for writing, what do you call it shaipdish (ph), so he was missing his golden box for cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="584">So, maybe this was their excuse to come here or to release us, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="585">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="586">I remember another thing. </sentence><sentence id="587">I remember the same day we heard in the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> the first order in Lithuanian language, "Nobody is to go out and nobody is to take arms," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="588">What each army is doing when it's coming into an <span class="region">occupied area</span>, but one, I think it was the last paragraph there, was for each German soldier will be shot, it will be shot 100 Jewish people signed by Colonel Bobyalous (ph), the commandant of <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">He was appointed right now. </sentence><sentence id="590">And now, let me tell you the same, a year ago when I visited <span class="country">Lithuania</span> as a member of a delegation from the <span class="building">Knesset</span> I met in the <span class="building">parliament</span> the son of Mr. Bobyalous, head of  0 the committee of defense and foreign affairs. </sentence><sentence id="591">And he should be my host to take me so I avoided twice to shake hands with him, and I didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: We were talking about how -- what was going on when the Nazis occupied <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, occupied <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="635">As I understand it, there was a tremendous amount of chaos, certainly in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="636">People were being beaten, killed, taken out. </sentence><sentence id="637">I don't know if this was something that you saw or experienced? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: Something I saw through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, and I avoided such things to see, naturally, and I saw through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, for instance, that a young man is going on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and somebody is arresting him or holding him. </sentence><sentence id="643">This young man took from his pocket a certain paper and showed it to the others -- no I think they told him to go back. </sentence><sentence id="644">He refused. </sentence><sentence id="645">That I understood from his movements, and they showed a certain paper maybe it was -- he get it from the Germans, or he worked for somebody already, so they become very angry and took him by the two sides and arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="646">And what makes me very bad feelings is that all the crowds on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, they are trying to make a lynch of him. </sentence><sentence id="647">So, then I felt it's not only the Germans, but everybody enemy to each Jew, even to people who were not Communists, who were not part of the Soviet government. </sentence><sentence id="648">It's enough to be a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="649">So, for instance, my grandfather, I came to visit him because he was living in the more quieter <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> than mine, so my parents decided we are living maybe too much in the center of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, so it's more dangerous so let's go to the grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="650">The Grandfather was living on a small <span class="dlf">street</span> called <span class="dlf">Nomonu (ph) Street</span>, <span class="dlf">Nomonu 14</span>, I think, and everything was very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="651">It was a <span class="dlf">garden</span> on the corner, very idealistic, very quiet, and some day came a Lithuanian, civilian Lithuanian with a rifle and come to see. </sentence><sentence id="652">So, he told that he is running after people to work, taking them to work. </sentence><sentence id="653">That was a daily habit. </sentence><sentence id="654">Jewish people were taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="655">It was part of a to work or to making them work -- it was part of making them that everybody can see them in bad situation, the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="656">That, for instance, an old man has to go with two <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="657">He's in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and everybody is going and beating him and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="658">So, it was much more than only physical work. </sentence><sentence id="659">So, once such man with a rifle come to take my old, old grandfather to work. </sentence><sentence id="660">My grandfather refused. </sentence><sentence id="661">So, he even didn't talk to him Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="662">My grandfather asked me to tell him that he's too old. </sentence><sentence id="663">So, he told me that he will take him by force. </sentence><sentence id="664">So, the grandfather told me to tell him that nothing will help, and they can't take him. </sentence><sentence id="665">So, nothing will -- we will not go. </sentence><sentence id="666">And my grandfather has experience from World War I that I knew also with all the gangs in <span class="country">Russia</span> when they were deported to <span class="country">Russia</span> by the Czars in the -- during the revolution that each gang who come -- occupies a certain <span class="populated place">city</span> took people and arrested them sometimes he cruel to them, so, he had very, very good experience of life. </sentence><sentence id="667">1 would not say good, but rich, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="668">So, he refused, and what happened, in a certain moment I saw two German soldiers are coming with a Lithuanian guy. </sentence><sentence id="669">Afterwards I was told that a neighbor from the same <span class="building">building</span> saw that the old and very distinguished Mr. Dovid Levin is taken by such a hooligan, to work, he was very shocked. </sentence><sentence id="670">So far, that her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where two German soldiers were put to live there -- it happened in all <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="671">It was a custom that in each <span class="building">house</span> had to take some soldiers and they were living there. </sentence><sentence id="672">She said, "Look they are going to take this old man to work." </sentence><sentence id="673">So, they come and saved him. </sentence><sentence id="674">That was very -- I was  2 very impressed by this. </sentence><sentence id="675">Soldiers, but not Gestapo and not other soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="676">A private or a corporal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1097">A: I can tell you only what I have seen, in these times I have seen Jewish policemen, and I was told -- so | remember that when we come to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> it should be one or two days before the 15th of August 1941. </sentence><sentence id="1098">We found already <span class="building">Jewish police</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Some of them were occupied by helping to build the <span class="dlf">fence</span> and some of them were also staying and working some places, the <span class="dlf">lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1100">The <span class="dlf">lines</span> of the <span class="building">stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1101">There were special <span class="building">stores</span> for Jewish people, already in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, so maybe they are moved to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1102">Anyway, there were certain places to deliver food, very small <span class="building">homes</span>, very small at the beginning of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So, you can feel, I could feel that somebody is -- we knew that it is a committee so that we can feel that someone is taking care, or delivering food. </sentence><sentence id="1104">Somebody has to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And also, the policemen are, they must have more higher degrees of commanders and so on, so we knew that it is a certain organization which is responsible for the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and this 100 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1106">But we didn't know how much they can decide, how long, how far. </sentence><sentence id="1107">That we couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="1108">I remember that one day it was Yom Kippur when many people were praying so we saw that from, he is coming a Jewish man, his name is Luria (ph), Luria, and he's telling, "Look we know you are going to pray. </sentence><sentence id="1109">It's very important for you, maybe also for us, but what's more important is you have stopped to do it and everybody who is in a certain age," he tell them, "You have to come and to work very, very urgent, because Germans demand I don't know how many thousands or so many Jewish workers for their war effort." </sentence><sentence id="1110">Maybr he told us the <span class="dlf">aerodromes</span> (ph), the <span class="building">airports</span>.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1665">A: Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which stage. </sentence><sentence id="1666">I know, but not -- I don't remember, those are two things. </sentence><sentence id="1667">It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943, for me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days. </sentence><sentence id="1668">It was deportation to <span class="country">Estonia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1669">At that morning, I -- the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was closed. </sentence><sentence id="1670">Nobody went to work outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another place, to say a parole, a certain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another place. </sentence><sentence id="1671">When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And when I passed my <span class="building">home</span>, my <span class="building">building</span> where we were living, our <span class="building">residence</span>, I saw that a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> staying near the <span class="building">house</span> and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe  7 Lithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I was passing very close let's say about ten, fifteen meters. </sentence><sentence id="1674">They have seen me, I have seen them. </sentence><sentence id="1675">My sister was very crying, very crying. </sentence><sentence id="1676">My father was saying, in a position, or in a stride, "Everything is lost." </sentence><sentence id="1677">He saw me and made such (gesturing). </sentence><sentence id="1678">He didn't say it, but, "What we can do?" </sentence><sentence id="1679">Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye. </sentence><sentence id="1680">It means, "Go away!" </sentence><sentence id="1681">and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October was 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would become again a good son and join the family where they are going. </sentence><sentence id="1682">Because I didn't expect that they will be taken, and why? </sentence><sentence id="1683">Because several days before, this my commander come to me and asking me, "I would like to know the names of your father, your mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards, number," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the underground people will be defended. </sentence><sentence id="1685">So, when I saw that also they are taking I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the <span class="building">Elderstrat</span>, with the authorities through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, didn't work, or maybe another thing, so that's a puncture. </sentence><sentence id="1687">To think that my family they are taken so what makes the decision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my mother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in <span class="populated place">Wigoda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1688">She did it and it give me a motivation to go farther and even not to look back. </sentence><sentence id="1689">So, I went to the place I have to go. </sentence><sentence id="1690">It was ina certain <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1691">It was called <span class="building">Blocktzai</span> (ph), means <span class="building">Blocktzey</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1692">And there I had to say a certain parole. " </sentence><sentence id="1693">I want" -- the parole was, "I want to sleep here at night." </sentence><sentence id="1694">In Yiddish it (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the your main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this <span class="building">house</span> was staying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1695">He was a known policeman because before the war he was a very known box-man. </sentence><sentence id="1696">Maybe he asking me the question or another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working in cooperation with the -- with the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1697">That makes me also a good feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And afterwards, I was told to go to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1699">I went -- a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">After I come to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, they opened a <span class="dlf">door</span> on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> -- no the <span class="env feature">ground</span> was with ashes or something or small stones. </sentence><sentence id="1701">So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, "Go there." </sentence><sentence id="1702">I fell. </sentence><sentence id="1703">I think that I fell. </sentence><sentence id="1704">So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was dark, dark, very dark. </sentence><sentence id="1705">I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Very in silence, every half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants to go to the <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1707">I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they made. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Who wants to smoke, who wants drink. </sentence><sentence id="1709">One like with a chain. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I am telling them and he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise, anoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, "Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta," and people are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled them. </sentence><sentence id="1711">They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were hiding with me, but we made it an organized form. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So, I felt myself better. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I don't remember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody is taking care on me. </sentence><sentence id="1714">And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent again. </sentence><sentence id="1715">We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my watch. </sentence><sentence id="1716">I have yet my watch. </sentence><sentence id="1717">My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And when  8 we had to come out it was already evening. </sentence><sentence id="1719">In October the evening began early like now. </sentence><sentence id="1720">And we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, "You are free but you have to come back very soon. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Maybe this night we are leaving the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1722">Leaving the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, it means to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1723">I become again very happy. </sentence><sentence id="1724">So, I went to <span class="building">home</span>, <span class="building">home</span> was empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1725">And I have seen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen (ph) they were very surprised to see me, "How come you back?" </sentence><sentence id="1726">because they were sure if my family was taken so also me. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And they gave me some to eat and to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1728">We were not in the best relations, but now we become very close. </sentence><sentence id="1729">But I realize that many things are not in the same place, so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1730">But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> this night it's for me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me. </sentence><sentence id="1731">I didn't tell them, but I told them that I will not more live here in this place. </sentence><sentence id="1732">I'm going away. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Maybe they understood, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And when I come back to the place of concentration, it was in another hiding place on <span class="populated place">Stesbolyu</span> (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will happened and we have to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1735">We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Because what's <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1737"><span class="building">Home</span> without parents is no <span class="building">home</span>, or sister, no <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1738">So, I was not the only one who was in such a situation. </sentence><sentence id="1739">There were more, three, four, five, six. </sentence><sentence id="1740">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1741">So, we stayed in the same place and we sleep in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1742">We made arrangements to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1743">It was not in a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> but under a <span class="dlf">roof</span> of a small <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1744">So, it was <span class="interior space">space</span> for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1993">Q: If you can just very briefly repeat to me what it was that the Jewish policeman said to you that indicated he knew what was going on so that I understand that word parole. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1995">A: So change the word parole and password. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1997">Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1998">It's a full sentence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2001">A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> on their <span class="dlf">Block C</span> or <span class="dlf">Block Tze</span> (ph) as we called it, I knew him before. </sentence><sentence id="2002">I knew even his name. </sentence><sentence id="2003">His name was Daniel Billard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), it means, what do you need here? </sentence><sentence id="2004">I understood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole. </sentence><sentence id="2005">So, the answer on this password, or the parole was, "We have -- we get here or we have here to sleep this night." </sentence><sentence id="2006">In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't remember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole and he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go inside or in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> that I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling down, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a place to a certain <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2007">It was dark there, that what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2015">Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also <span class="interior space">Communists cells</span> or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Do you know -- what did you know about that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2019">A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized. </sentence><sentence id="2020">We called them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of Joe Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets, coats, but short. </sentence><sentence id="2022">But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left and some of them we knew even before the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Some change their places, come from the Zionists to the Communists and why? </sentence><sentence id="2024">Because as we understood, they are more than we. </sentence><sentence id="2025">They are a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2026">And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).He was a very known figure even in all the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, even outside the organization. </sentence><sentence id="2027">We knew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections outside with the partisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are the prominent people in the organization or their organization is more important than ours in the terms of communication with outside. </sentence><sentence id="2028">We knew the partisans can be only Soviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us. </sentence><sentence id="2029">And if Soviet partisans, it's Communists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to  3 lull them. </sentence><sentence id="2030">But in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big <span class="building">shelter</span> in terms of politics. </sentence><sentence id="2031">So, they felt themselves very good and very secure. </sentence><sentence id="2032">Even more when we had to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a preference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better position, or they had not to wait so long as our girls. </sentence><sentence id="2033">And I will not forget one thing that one of our girls, were organized in <span class="populated place">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai</span>, we were living this time already in a communa, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the <span class="dlf">street</span> was Mildos and the number of the <span class="building">house</span> was 7. </sentence><sentence id="2034">So it was called <span class="building">Milda 7</span> everybody, not everybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair. </sentence><sentence id="2035">The Communists have also their <span class="building">house</span> not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2036">So, the developments of all the <span class="building">houses</span> was similar. </sentence><sentence id="2037">People were alone without parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for the organization. </sentence><sentence id="2038">Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they have control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was good for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2039">So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa. </sentence><sentence id="2040">She was already taken to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> in order to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2041">She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put ina girl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> they have a cover name. </sentence><sentence id="2042">It was called <span class="building">Anti-Facists Fight Organizations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So, they have a preference and when we come, I come to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> I found a lot of people who belonged to their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only one girl. </sentence><sentence id="2044">For girls it was generally more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2045">It's because the high command of the partisans is <span class="populated place">Ruditsky</span>, or <span class="populated place">Rudniky</span> for us, demand they give preference for men, male good who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and better males than females. </sentence><sentence id="2046">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> organization had another pressure to do what they demand. </sentence><sentence id="2047">So, it all the time were compromise, here, there. </sentence><sentence id="2048">Anyway, the last decision that - - the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I am talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the <span class="env feature">Ruditsky Forest</span> which was called this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the <span class="building">Communist circles</span> or what was called <span class="building">Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations</span>, that is. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2086">A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people, but talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the <span class="populated place">Kovno Ghetto</span>, we are talking about three main organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2087">It <span class="building">Irgun Brei Tzion</span> (ph),  4 organization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="2088">It included also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one. </sentence><sentence id="2089">The other was what I mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we coordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2090">It was more or less also ideological very close. </sentence><sentence id="2091">So they afterwards established the collective of the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="2092">What I mentioned <span class="building">Mildos Sheva</span> (ph), <span class="building">Mildos 7</span> was together. </sentence><sentence id="2093">I would call it in one word the --as it means the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> of the Zionists. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2114">A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2116">Q: I think what you can is that the <span class="interior space">underground</span> -- because I don't think people know this -- was really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations maybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2118">A: Iam coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they were. </sentence><sentence id="2119">So, we are talking about underground in <span class="populated place">Kovno Ghetto</span>, maybe also other <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>,we are talking mostly about young people. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Young people it means maybe from 15, 16 till 30. </sentence><sentence id="2121">If they were more,they were exeptions. </sentence><sentence id="2122">And I will tell you who were the Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="2123">They were divided into three or four groups. </sentence><sentence id="2124">They were the general Zionists and the organization was called <span class="building">Abetze</span>, <span class="building">Irgun Brei Tzion</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2125">In this organization were also included some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2126">After -- the other was <span class="building">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair</span>, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair. </sentence><sentence id="2127">It also left workers" organization. </sentence><sentence id="2128">They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the collective or the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> called <span class="populated place">Mildos Sheva</span> (ph), <span class="building">Mildos 7</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2129">Sheva, it means seven in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="2130">We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2131">Therefore I am mentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me. </sentence><sentence id="2132">The other group was <span class="building">Beitar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2133">Beitar and other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And probably we can also include to this organizations <span class="building">Brit Tzion</span> (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till 60 or more. </sentence><sentence id="2135">It was an organization who helped the <span class="building">Abetze</span>, who were young people. </sentence><sentence id="2136">So, if talking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared to do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2137">The ABC, <span class="building">Abetze</span>, not ABC, <span class="building">Irgun Brei Tzion</span>, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar --  5 they were very involved in the life of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because their establishment of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was also Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="2138">If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib Garfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the Zionist organizations in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2139">So, it happen so also the staff of the <span class="building">Elderstrat</span> in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others. </sentence><sentence id="2140">So that it was natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground organization, with money, with means, with <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>, and what's most important, with covering them. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I mean, the <span class="building">police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2142">The <span class="building">Jewish Ghetto Police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I remember that our organization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the <span class="building">police</span> in order that they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Even there was one, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to serve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Anyway, the partition of work became so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist organization were more active in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because they are close to the <span class="building">Elderstrat</span>, they know many things they can get help on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2146">The Communist, the Anti-Facist Fight Organization they have very good connections with the outside, with the partisans, with the Communists outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And so it was a very good combinations between the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have one <span class="dlf">roof</span> in a certain place it was called, in a certain time it was called the <span class="building">MTC</span> it means <span class="building">Military Technical Commission</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2178">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2274">Q: So, how did you get out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2275">Try to remember and describe for me your escape from <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2278">A: Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several  7 times and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was like a dream, like a dream, and a good dream. </sentence><sentence id="2279">So one or two or some hours we have to wait again and to come again. </sentence><sentence id="2280">I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the organization like it would be God, for a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="2281">So, it comes the moment when they call, "Okay, now you have to go to the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2282">They prepared us, I think, with numbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there. </sentence><sentence id="2283">So, on the <span class="dlf">track</span>, I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police or Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="2284">After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make like they would be our escorts. </sentence><sentence id="2285">So, I had really to admire organization. </sentence><sentence id="2286">If they are so clever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything good. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, police or other and then at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch us and so on and somebody was asking, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="2288">so another voice answer, "Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of <span class="populated place">Baptai</span> (ph)," a certain place where Jewish use to work there, hard work. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And we moved. </sentence><sentence id="2290">They all begin to walk and we felt more than happy, but in a certain place not far from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2291">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="2292">We have to be very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2293">Not to questions or nothing, and what's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2294">For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and from me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2295">If I would be religious so I could not take with me , no, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2296">So I'm coming again when the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian, talking Russian. </sentence><sentence id="2297">After a few moments somebody saw a big <span class="spatial object">sack</span> with -- that was about ten or fifteen rifles. </sentence><sentence id="2298">I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and by this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political commander. </sentence><sentence id="2299">No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should know every stone on the <span class="dlf">highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2300">So, in certain moment he told us, "Now you are taking off your red stars and putting them in a certain place," or maybe eating them -- I don't remember, and he told, "Now you are partisans." </sentence><sentence id="2301">We have guns. </sentence><sentence id="2302">We have maybe hiding in certain places because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a search, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something, we can defend ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2303">So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to stand up and then we have to stand in a <span class="dlf">line</span> and we were walking by foot. </sentence><sentence id="2304">To put our white shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so they -- we could not be very easy watched because this <span class="region">area</span> was with snow and we went, and we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us. </sentence><sentence id="2305">We also have not private packs but things to take for the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, for the <span class="building">bases</span>, maybe a radio, maybe other things, maybe medicaments for the small <span class="building">hospital</span> that we had in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, maybe other things, maybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go. </sentence><sentence id="2306">I remember some of the people collapsed on the way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2336">Q: How many were there with you? </sentence><sentence id="2337"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2340">A: Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2342">Q: Men and women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2344">A: Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine guns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Even the girls had guns, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack. </sentence><sentence id="2347">So, at night we come to a place in a certain <span class="populated place">village</span>, and we were told that we have not to go in only one -- everybody in one <span class="building">house</span> not in the middle of the <span class="populated place">village</span> but in the side. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Excuse me, it was not -- it was at day. </sentence><sentence id="2349">At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go. </sentence><sentence id="2350">At day, we come to a certain <span class="building">house</span> like a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, let's call it <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2351">So everybody come to this <span class="dlf">farm</span> we weren't allowed to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people. </sentence><sentence id="2353">So it was a neighbor come to see his neighbor. " </sentence><sentence id="2354">You are very nice, you are our neighbor but you cannot leave." </sentence><sentence id="2355">You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others. </sentence><sentence id="2356">Nobody is leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2357">Afterwards come his wife to look after him. </sentence><sentence id="2358">What is he doing, my husband. </sentence><sentence id="2359">Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also. " </sentence><sentence id="2360">You will stay with your husband." </sentence><sentence id="2361">Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2362">As evening, a lot of people with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order. </sentence><sentence id="2363">Some were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And so we make it like two or three days until we come to the <span class="env feature">forests</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2365">Yes, and before we come to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> we have to cross a very critical point. </sentence><sentence id="2366">It was a <span class="dlf">railway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2367">The <span class="dlf">railways</span> were very watched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing. </sentence><sentence id="2368">Anyway we have to make operation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here, and we did it. </sentence><sentence id="2369">After that we have to cross a <span class="dlf">highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Also, more or less the same tactic and then we were told now we are in the <span class="region">partisan area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2371"><span class="region">Partisan area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Also, we have to go with the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more. </sentence><sentence id="2373">But, for me it was another tension. </sentence><sentence id="2374">If we are already in the kingdom of the partisans, so it's the tension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this. </sentence><sentence id="2375">Sometimes I have seen signs on <span class="env feature">trees</span>, heavy <span class="env feature">trees</span> with <span class="env feature">swamps</span> around them and sometimes we have to go on a very narrow <span class="env feature">tree</span> which was lying. </sentence><sentence id="2376">So, as it moved like in a story, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in <span class="country">Russia</span> or other places, and we have seen sometimes on the <span class="env feature">trees</span> signs red, or white, or together so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us. </sentence><sentence id="2377">I was so trusting of the organizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2378">It was another authority for me. </sentence><sentence id="2379">So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs. </sentence><sentence id="2380">One moment we saw a man with a big, full hat, a <span class="spatial object">Papacha</span> (ph) it's called, of <span class="region">Siberia</span>, with an automatic arm and he told us a password, in Russian parole. </sentence><sentence id="2381">He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before they told him so he come smiling to us, "You're partisans," and he shook hands with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2382">But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the girls and we have also weak people. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Some people are very strong outside but here it was a hero who can make the way can also be a . </sentence><sentence id="2384">Until we come to our <span class="building">bases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2385">In our <span class="building">bases</span> also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, our man. </sentence><sentence id="2386">Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to told that the group came from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2387">He himself could let us come inside. </sentence><sentence id="2388">He did it,  9 he went, and the other was watching us, it must be. </sentence><sentence id="2389">And afterward come the commander of the attachment and invited us all with greetings, "Now you can come in, you can come." </sentence><sentence id="2390">And that was a big celebration. </sentence><sentence id="2391">Everybody was asking me what happened with my uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, "Have you tobacco?" </sentence><sentence id="2392">or maybe it was the first question. </sentence><sentence id="2393">I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I have nothing to smoke for myself. </sentence><sentence id="2394">But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its come to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's not so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already taken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a German, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic incidents even between the partisans and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2395">But we were talking half the night until we asleep. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2448">Q: Now, when you met with these other people in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, were they all Jews, were they Soviet partisans? </sentence><sentence id="2449">I'm wondering who these other people were. </sentence><sentence id="2450">Were they all part of your organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2454"> A This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated "Death to the occupants or the conquerors," in English. </sentence><sentence id="2455">So, it was a mixed unit from two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment. </sentence><sentence id="2456">Lithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> in order to establish this detachment. </sentence><sentence id="2457">A big part were former prisoner of wars, Russian, who escaped from their <span class="populated place">camps</span>, <span class="populated place">P.O.W. camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2458">And a big part, I think in the beginning the people of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and more and more till a day what from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> nobody could no more join us for internal things that happened in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so this turning point afterward we become less and less and less. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2465">Q: And you said there were incidents of anti-Semitism, even with the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2467">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2469">Q: Did you experience any of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2471">A: Lhave, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2472">First at all, I heard the word ours and yours. </sentence><sentence id="2473">What does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="2474">For me everybody was now somebody very close. </sentence><sentence id="2475">We are fighting together, and there, ours and yours. </sentence><sentence id="2476">And I've seen that also they are living in the same -- incertain concentration of Jewish partisans and un-Jewish, not formal, but de-facto. </sentence><sentence id="2477">So, I have another example. </sentence><sentence id="2478">One of our guys, he was, he come really with us. </sentence><sentence id="2479">A nice boy, a tall boy, he was dead because he ate too much. </sentence><sentence id="2480">He was hungry too much and something happened to his stomach and he passed away so we buried him. </sentence><sentence id="2481">So, what happened, it comes only the commissar and made a speech, "Ta, ta, ta, ta," and from the fighters they are not only Jewish fighters. </sentence><sentence id="2482">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2483">There were other things, but I'm not sure if it was  0 anti-Semitism or not, some partisans, Jewish partisans, were shot by their comrades on the way to a certain <span class="building">missions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2484">They came without them and told a story there that was very suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2485">End of Tape #4  1 Tape #5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2501">Q: How long were you in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> fighting with the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2503">A: I was till the first week of July 1944, and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2505">Q: I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2507">A: I was in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, or better, in the <span class="env feature">Rudniky Forest</span>, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or the Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2508">So, we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> because <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> was very close to us about 20 miles or so. </sentence><sentence id="2509">But then happened a certain event that was for us, for me personally, very important. </sentence><sentence id="2510">The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a girl partisan from the <span class="building">Wilno detachment</span> which were located not far. </sentence><sentence id="2511">We were all the time, we had, I would say, unlegal relations. </sentence><sentence id="2512">She was also from <span class="populated place">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2513">She was sent by Abba Kovner (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2514">Abba Kovner was the commando of the <span class="building">Wilno detachment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Her name was Ruska Kolchak (ph), a very known partisan. </sentence><sentence id="2516">She told -- came half secretly to us and told us, "You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>, but when you come, in <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>, please don't leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="2517">You will be in a new organization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to <span class="country">Palestine</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2518">And we were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and we come to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> and then was the beginning of a new organization. </sentence><sentence id="2519">Afterwards, this organization gets the name <span class="populated place">Bricha</span> (ph), it means escaping. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And I was working for the archives of the internal ministry of <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, it's called <span class="building">Ainkavede</span> (ph), yes. </sentence><sentence id="2521">I was very proud that they took me. </sentence><sentence id="2522">They took me because I knew several languages and I was intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="2523">So, I attended <span class="building">high school</span>, so they took me, and I was working there. </sentence><sentence id="2524">One of my jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers. </sentence><sentence id="2525">And I did it with pleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the Germans made on our activity of my <span class="building">detachments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2526">We also found list of names of Lithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again very happy that I can do some important thing. </sentence><sentence id="2527">But at the same time, we were building another unlegal organization to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2528">And one of this was to prepare false documents to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span> or by <span class="spatial object">buses</span> -- not <span class="spatial object">buses</span> but by <span class="dlf">tracks</span> or by foot or by any means to go to <span class="populated place">Chernovtsy</span>, it means in <span class="populated place">Bucovina</span> in the <span class="region">south</span>, southwest of <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2529">From there to smuggle the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Romania</span> and there we were told maybe that we can find a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2530">That's close enough. </sentence><sentence id="2531">From <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, or from <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> to <span class="populated place">Bucuresti</span> was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles. </sentence><sentence id="2532">So, we did it bit by bit man after man. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I left <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>, I left my job, I left <span class="populated place">Wilno</span>, I left my arms, with a girlfriend from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, with her small sister like we are a family. </sentence><sentence id="2534">I am the father, she is the mother and the small sister is our daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2535">It makes less dangerous for us. </sentence><sentence id="2536">We get also a card, how to go from which place to which place, to whom to apply and what will be our passports. </sentence><sentence id="2537">And we did it. </sentence><sentence id="2538">And for instance, I left <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> I think the 19th of January 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2539">It means a  2 half year after I left the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2540">I didn't want to come back to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> because I hate <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> because every man in the <span class="dlf">street</span> was a killer of my family or other of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="2541"><span class="populated place">Wilno</span> was for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not to go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our <span class="spatial object">train</span> was to leave very fast this <span class="country">country</span>, this lousy <span class="country">country</span> of anti-Semitism and killers and all the bad things that I suffered, not only me but our whole <span class="populated place">communities</span>, whole generation. </sentence><sentence id="2542">So, we went to <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> to <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>, from <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> to <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, I'm talking about <span class="country">Byelorussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2543">From <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span> to <span class="populated place">Koval</span>, from <span class="populated place">Koval</span> to <span class="populated place">Volpe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2544">In each place we found a man he some give us to eat, sometimes also to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2545">Sometimes we slept outside on a <span class="interior space">roof</span> of a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, but we did it and in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> it is <span class="region">Galicia</span> or <span class="region">west Ukraine</span>, then we met with some girls partisans we can call them liaison officers, L-I-A-S-O-N, so one of them, I remember was Zelda, she was also, she did such a job also between <span class="populated place">Wilno ghetto</span> and the <span class="env feature">forests</span> and we went -- and we were sleeping in the <span class="building">Jewish library</span> of <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, by there were two -- were several people, more and more and they have to go farther. </sentence><sentence id="2546">So we heard one day that Chernovtsy one of the groups were caught and put into the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2547">If so, the way is closed to that and we were talking it's burned. </sentence><sentence id="2548">If so, we have to go to chose an alternative <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2549">I even was sent for a while to other places in the <span class="region">south</span>, to <span class="populated place">Stansislav</span>, it's also the area of <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, in order to make sure what happened in <span class="populated place">Chernovtsy</span> because -- anyway I come back to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> it's <span class="populated place">Lemburg</span>, so I give a report and we decided to go straight from <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2550">To go to <span class="country">Poland</span> we have to take new documents that we are Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2551">So we made it, we crossed the <span class="dlf">border</span> and the next day we were in a <span class="populated place">city</span> called <span class="populated place">Pshemysl</span>, or <span class="populated place">Peremyshl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2552">There we also have to wait for several weeks, two weeks or three weeks and we made also a new <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2553">We are living together and tried to go farther, also to make new documents because we didn't talk Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2554">In <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, the Jewish people, our generation, doesn't understand Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2555">Even not to talk, and if you are talking, everybody will see that we are foreigners and that was very dangerous because we escaped from the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and that only traitors are doing or enemies of the people and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2556">They will catch us and they will send us to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, if not to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="2557">So, we went from <span class="populated place">Pshemysl</span> to <span class="populated place">Zeshev</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2558">In <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="2568">It was an incident he would -- he want that we will meet a really group from <span class="country">Greece</span> and so we were very afraid they will recognize that we are not. </sentence><sentence id="2569">So, we said, "No, we are very tired and we have to go immediately." </sentence><sentence id="2570">He gave us documents and we went. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2852">A: Oh, I think that my childhood and what you call boyhood, is a new word for me, I never heard it, but I like it, it, I think it's a continuity, nothing happened because when I came  6 to <span class="country">Palestine</span> I found many of my family of my uncles, aunts, cousins, classmates who did it before from the organization from <span class="populated place">Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair</span>, so it was a <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2853">A <span class="dlf">road</span> that everybody will do it before or after, so for me it was so natural, only what happened, the Holocaust and all the things after and maybe also include the Soviet time 1940 and 1941, it was something out the order for me. </sentence><sentence id="2854">But to come to <span class="country">Palestine</span> what for me it was like two and two are four. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2860"> A Yeah, but <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> was a very modern community. </sentence><sentence id="2861"><span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, <span class="country">Lithuania</span> of <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, even more than <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> was called the <span class="region">Eretz Yisrael</span> of the Diaspora. </sentence><sentence id="2862">So sometimes we were also -- it was not all the community but we were brought up in a Jewish, Yiddish, or Communist ideology but if we take, I would say about 60 percent of the Lithuanian Jewry they were brought up in the way that I was brought up. </sentence><sentence id="2863">May I give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="2864">In 1935 there were elections in all the world for the Zionist Congress. </sentence><sentence id="2865">It happened every two years so in this small <span class="country">Lithuania</span> with about 155,000 Jewish people inhabitants, they took part in this elections about, I think, more than 45,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="2866">Maybe some of them did it not seriously, they did automatically, and maybe they were not very strong Zionists, but anyway in this time is a need of the 30's the Zionist, I would not even tell Zionists, the national feeling was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="2867">The Hebrew culture was dominating. </sentence><sentence id="2868">So, even religious people were Zionist, so it's not a contradiction. </sentence><sentence id="2869">So, I cannot see that <span class="country">Israel</span> in the 40's when I came was something new for me. </sentence><sentence id="2870">I'll give you another example. </sentence><sentence id="2871">When the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, no it was a <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, no more <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, it was a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> from <span class="building">Egged company</span> took us from the place I was at night in the <span class="populated place">village</span> <span class="populated place">Givat Chen</span>, to the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, I was sitting and I remember a woman asked me, "Where are we now? </sentence><sentence id="2872">What is here?" </sentence><sentence id="2873">It's a long way it's about four hours. </sentence><sentence id="2874">So I told her, "You don't know? </sentence><sentence id="2875">That's the <span class="dlf">Mount Tabor</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2876">So, because I knew the geography of <span class="country">Palestine</span>, or <span class="region">Eretz Yisrael</span>, more than of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2877">And you know like a fish who is in an <span class="spatial object">aquarium</span> and put back to the original <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2878">That happened to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
