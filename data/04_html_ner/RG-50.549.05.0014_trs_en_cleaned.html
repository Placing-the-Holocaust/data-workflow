<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Or why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: I guess it was better for business for my father, was more central, as far as selling or transferring goods. </sentence><sentence id="102">I'm just guessing. </sentence><sentence id="103">I have no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="104">I guess it was just better for the family, you know, more centrally located. </sentence><sentence id="105">I would assume that because the <span class="populated place">village</span> where we were born, didn't even have a <span class="spatial object">train</span> come through there. </sentence><sentence id="106">You had to go with a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> from that <span class="populated place">town</span> to the <span class="building">train station</span>, which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles away. </sentence><sentence id="107">So there was absolutely nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="108">It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my grandparents had some <span class="region">land</span> there and all that. </sentence><sentence id="109">But I would assume that's the main reason. </sentence><sentence id="110">He still traveled down to all the <span class="populated place">villages</span> and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his <span class="building">warehouse</span> and all that was in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and, you know, where they process the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="111">That's as far as I can remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Ah, I don't know what the problem... I only went to one grade, okay, before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="126">And so it was, I would assume it was considered a <span class="building">public school</span>, but it was a Jewish, ran by the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">And basically all the children in the <span class="building">school</span> were Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="128">But whether it was, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I...but it wasn't religious. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know, geography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">That's what we learned, but it was basically, all Jewish children went there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So was that sanctioned by the <span class="populated place">state</span> at that point? </sentence><sentence id="139">That the Jewish... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: That's what I'm saying, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="143">I assume that it was, but there's no way for me to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1328">Q: Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in <span class="country">Sweden</span>, did you, I'm trying to think of how to form the question. </sentence><sentence id="1329">But I'm wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Did you have any understanding of what...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1334">A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that's the only thing that... you know. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And then as I got older and I read. </sentence><sentence id="1336">I'm not educated very well. </sentence><sentence id="1337">I finished <span class="building">high school</span> GED and I got some <span class="building">college</span> behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. </sentence><sentence id="1338">But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically... I don't blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in <span class="building">churches</span> and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do. </sentence><sentence id="1339">They always kept them outside of the <span class="populated place">mainstream society</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. </sentence><sentence id="1341">So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And then the <span class="building">church</span> teaching basically demonized them. </sentence><sentence id="1343">So, I don't think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn't, didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Because it's supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they're teaching. </sentence><sentence id="1345">But I guess that wasn't what, what actually happened. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I've seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And what human being would do something like that? </sentence><sentence id="1349">And then they go to <span class="building">church</span> to pray? </sentence><sentence id="1350">I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Take a look right now. </sentence><sentence id="1352"><span class="country">Sudan</span>, got a Muslim against the Christians. </sentence><sentence id="1353"><span class="region">Northern Ireland</span>, Catholics against the Protestants. </sentence><sentence id="1354">You go to <span class="country">India</span>, you got the... <span class="country">Sri Lanka</span>, you got one sect fighting another and again it's religion. </sentence><sentence id="1355"><span class="country">Iraq</span>, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. </sentence><sentence id="1356">So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. </sentence><sentence id="1357">That's my view. </sentence></p></dialogue>
