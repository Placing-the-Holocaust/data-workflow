<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: <span class="building">Boy scouts</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Then subsequent laws mandated that the men go into service, into the <span class="building">labor brigades</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">That must have been around 1940. </sentence><sentence id="356">I'm not clear on it. </sentence><sentence id="357">My father was drafted into this, but because he had a medal for -- a bronze medal for heroism during the first world war, he went in as a company commander and was in for -- my guess is for a couple of years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: What did the armband look like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: It was the <span class="spatial object">Hungarian flag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="754">And at a certain point again, within a few weeks of the Germans coming in, we were no longer allowed to go <span class="building">home</span> at night, so I slept in the -- in the <span class="building">printing place</span> and worked at my job. </sentence><sentence id="755">I got some money for it all day long, and then I took another job packing the <span class="spatial object">magazines</span> and loading <span class="spatial object">cars</span> with -- <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> with it, which was extra money. </sentence><sentence id="756">My mother -- my mother at that time was by herself in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and was able to bring me food once a day, so I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="757">And that system went on and I was able to go <span class="building">home</span> once in awhile because of the armband that allowed me to move outside of curfew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: Was this a very frightening time for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: It was, because we were not only restricted in movement and feared really for our lives when we were out or even in the <span class="building">home</span>, but we were also being bombed by the Americans as well as the British. </sentence><sentence id="766">So that was really the beginning of the really tough times because by that time food shortage, also death was easy to come by because of the bombings which were quite heavy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: What did you do when bombing raids came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: Usually the sirens went off and went down into the <span class="interior space">cellars</span>, which were reinforced. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="772">And on May 2nd there was a particularly heavy bombing raid where -- where I was in a <span class="building">printing plant</span>, was -- and that <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> was hit fairly heavily, so we felt the <span class="env feature">earth</span> shake and the dust and it was rather scary. </sentence><sentence id="773"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="774"> Interview with Ivan Becker 23 And after the raid was over, I went <span class="building">home</span> and found that the one half of the <span class="building">house</span> was also bombed. </sentence><sentence id="775">And our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was basically blown out. </sentence><sentence id="776">The <span class="dlf">walls</span> and the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were blown out so that we couldn't stay up in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, but had to move down a few <span class="interior space">floors</span> and moved in with a family including our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="777">And so we lived there basically until we were finally taken away, but -- so that -- and shortly after that May bombing, it became quite unsafe to be in the <span class="building">printing place</span>, so I essentially moved back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="779">Q: What was happening to your father during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: My father, we didn't know -- we didn't know where he was or what was happening to him. </sentence><sentence id="781">There was no communication at that point that I can recall, not until much later. </sentence><sentence id="782">So it was strictly my mother and I trying to make a go of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="790">A: During the -- during the curfew I was out and I visited friends. </sentence><sentence id="791">And I remember one particular time that -- again, my recollection is that we had curfew in the morning and then we had to be <span class="building">home</span> and then curfew opened in the afternoon again. </sentence><sentence id="792">And I went off to a friend's <span class="building">house</span>, and I didn't call my mother that I am not coming <span class="building">home</span> until later in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="793">And when I showed up, of course, she was out of her mind and got a real severe spanking for scaring her, which I could understand. </sentence><sentence id="794">But at that time I guess I was not frightened of what could be happening to me, so I did not think that I should call her. </sentence><sentence id="795">But that was quite clear in my mind what happened then. </sentence><sentence id="796"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 24 But we have played with friends in the <span class="building">house</span>, and so except for the curfew when we went out and had to stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for food. </sentence><sentence id="797">We had ration stamps. </sentence><sentence id="798">We had to go out to find -- try to find some bread and -- which was by that time made from rice flour because wheat was no longer available. </sentence><sentence id="799">And there were shortages of food, meat only once in a great while, very little sugar, very little staple food available. </sentence><sentence id="800">And certainly during the curfew times, of course, all the Jews were out and trying to find the <span class="building">shops</span> that had something. </sentence><sentence id="801">And sometimes the <span class="dlf">lines</span> were long and the curfew came so you had to go <span class="building">home</span> empty-handed, which was difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="814">Q: What was your health like at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="816">A: I was not aware of being underfed, particularly. </sentence><sentence id="817">I remember that bananas and oranges were something that I remembered from early childhood and I was really -- would have loved to have some. </sentence><sentence id="818">I think that bananas to this day has a significance because I remember eating it as a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: But your health was okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: But my health was okay. </sentence><sentence id="825">So was my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="826">We were in reasonably good shape. </sentence><sentence id="827">As the summer wore on, things got tighter and the bombing got worse, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="828">Q: Did you -- did you see any deportations during the summer? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="829">A: I believe that I was aware of the fact that the -- my father's family was deported, was taken away from <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">I don't think it was called deportation. </sentence><sentence id="831">I was not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="832">I remember hearing people receiving postcards from various places in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I believe, or <span class="country">Poland</span> with stamps saying that we're okay, we're working, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="833">And of course that was a sham we found out many, many years later. </sentence><sentence id="834">So the awareness that they were killing the people, we did not have the awareness. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: Did you see people in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> being taken away? </sentence><sentence id="842">Did you ever witness that? </sentence><sentence id="843"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 25 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="844">A: No, because <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> was not really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="845">Q: The summer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Summer of "44 was still reasonably safe. </sentence><sentence id="848">No one was deported because the Germans concentrated on the 400,000 in the <span class="region">provinces</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: In the <span class="region">provinces</span>, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: And so we did not see any of it. </sentence><sentence id="854">What we did see, of course, later on when they started deporting people from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, but that's not until September, October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="858">So the summer went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="861">A: The summer went on. </sentence><sentence id="862">Again, staying alive because of bombings was paramount. </sentence><sentence id="863">We spent an awful lot of time down in the <span class="interior space">cellars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="864">We really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: What did you do when you were down in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: Kind of sat around in the dark and hoped that the bomb is not going to hit us. </sentence><sentence id="867">We were across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">western railroad station</span>, and so we were in a prime <span class="region">target area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="868">And when in May the bombing finally got our <span class="building">house</span>, it was a fluke because the Americans were fairly accurate. </sentence><sentence id="869">Their system was -- is to send in an <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> and to circle the <span class="region">target area</span> with smoke in the <span class="dlf">sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="870">And the bomber stream unloaded into that <span class="dlf">circle</span>, saturation bombing. </sentence><sentence id="871">The May that we got it but the <span class="building">railroad station</span> didn't, the wind took that <span class="dlf">circle</span> and we got clobbered. </sentence><sentence id="872">So the raids were pretty regular. </sentence><sentence id="873">Around 10:00 at night they started, so by 20 of 10:00 we were down in the <span class="interior space">cellars</span> expecting it. </sentence><sentence id="874"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 26 And I was working as a -- well, my doctor, my pediatrician was the head of the volunteer ambulance corps in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="875">And after my stint in the <span class="building">printing place</span>, I asked him -- I suppose I had to ask him to see if I can get trained as a first aid person. </sentence><sentence id="876">And I went through a course with adults, being the youngest to graduate from that course, and so I was a full-fledged first aid type. </sentence><sentence id="877">And as such, I did not go down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> until the bombs came awfully close. </sentence><sentence id="878">We were also fire guards. </sentence><sentence id="879">We were 15, so we didn't like the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">It was a horrible place to be. </sentence><sentence id="881">And so my poor mother scared out of her wits for me, but I was all over the <span class="building">house</span> and watching for the <span class="spatial object">aircraft</span> to come and the <span class="spatial object">antiaircraft</span> trying to shoot them down. </sentence><sentence id="882">And when a bomb started whistling too close, then we ran down. </sentence><sentence id="883">So I really did not spend that much time in the <span class="interior space">cellars</span>, ever really. </sentence><sentence id="884">I felt it was better to die up there than not. </sentence><sentence id="885">One of the things that also happened in the -- after we had to wear the yellow star, that the <span class="building">Vatican curia</span> I guess made an arrangement with the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi government, that if a Jew converted, then they would wear a different color, I think it was either white or yellow or just white armband, and they would be basically exempt from the curfew or from the deportation, from the taking them to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>, <span class="building">labor brigades</span>. </sentence><sentence id="886">And our superintendent's son, who was a priest in <span class="populated place">Rome</span>, came back to the <span class="building">apartment house</span> and was trying to convert the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="887">His name was Kuhn, <span class="building">K-U-H-N</span>, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="888">And my mother and I went, took a few lessons, learned a catechism, and after awhile I refused to go back. </sentence><sentence id="889">And I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not right at age 15. </sentence><sentence id="890">Not being a Jew, I don't know where that came from, but that was my feeling. </sentence><sentence id="891">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="892">It also led to another during the Korean War, that kind of a feeling surfaced once again when I was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="893"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 27 But the priest ultimately became known as the hanging priest of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="894">He was -- and I think that the <span class="building">museum</span> has a picture of him with a pistol on his cassock. </sentence><sentence id="895">And he went around the <span class="dlf">streets</span> shooting Jews. </sentence><sentence id="896">And he was hung shortly after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="897">But it was kind ofa dichotomy that he's trying to convert but his hatred was such that he would shoot those who didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: Did your mother willingly leave the conversion lessons also with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="935">It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in making some decisions. </sentence><sentence id="936">One of them was a life-and-death decision. </sentence><sentence id="937">There was a suicide in the <span class="building">house</span> once. </sentence><sentence id="938">Somebody jumped off the <span class="interior space">floor</span> above us and died. </sentence><sentence id="939">And I kind of remembered that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">That surfaced later on. </sentence><sentence id="941">But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to be maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="942">And I remember being out on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away from <span class="building">home</span> and coming <span class="building">home</span> after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging through and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="943">And I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that 90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I remember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an <span class="dlf">arch</span> in an <span class="building">apartment house</span> and were cowering, lying on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="944">And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb within 20 feet of us, right in the open <span class="region">arch area</span>, and we had to step over it to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="945">And of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things were -- bombings were three, four times a day really. </sentence><sentence id="946">And of course the Nazis were getting worse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on foot or in the <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="947">And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point. </sentence><sentence id="948"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="949"> Interview with Ivan Becker 28 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: Were you ever stopped by any of the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: No, Iwas not. </sentence><sentence id="952">I looked very much like a German kid. </sentence><sentence id="953">I was blond, very light blond. </sentence><sentence id="954">I also wore the <span class="building">school</span> uniform coat, which was a -- an old Hungarian type uniform -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: But you had the star on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: -- with braids. </sentence><sentence id="957">But I had the star on. </sentence><sentence id="958">The period I'm referring to really, I took the star off and was on the <span class="dlf">street</span> without the star moving around without any papers. </sentence><sentence id="959">And of course -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: This is September-October you're talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: I would say October-November. </sentence><sentence id="962">And I don't know how I had the guts to do it or why. </sentence><sentence id="963">I just did it. </sentence><sentence id="964">And I moved because I didn't like restriction. </sentence><sentence id="965">And it pretty much had to be that period, although I was doing that out of the <span class="building">Swedish house</span> also for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="966">But at any rate, I moved around. </sentence><sentence id="967">The danger, of course, was -- is that if you were stopped, you had no papers, pulled your pants down and if you were circumcised, they killed you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Well, I think there's two periods of time; one, certainly after after coming back or after going through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I did not deny it but I did not practice. </sentence><sentence id="2145">I did not go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> or a <span class="building">temple</span> until 1 got until I met my wife. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Her father was came out to the <span class="country">States</span> from <span class="country">Russia</span> but he was about the same age as I was, became a pharmacist. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And was while not very religious, came out of <span class="building">orthodox home</span> and kept the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="2148">They were the first who invited me to go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> with them and it was the first time I went after 1944. </sentence><sentence id="2149">So 1964, in 20 years, no Jewishness whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="2150">Didn't deny it but didn't identify it because I was afraid of what's going to happen here, that it could happen here. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And the fact I remember when I came to the <span class="country">States</span> and found out that most everybody every man is circumcised, and that you didn't have to have an identification card, and you didn't have to report to the police, that was the first time I remember relaxing. </sentence><sentence id="2152">But nevertheless, I tried to assimilate again and spoke no Hungarian, practiced no Judaism for certainly 20 years and Hungarian even beyond. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And I managed to learn quite well to speak without an accent on me. </sentence><sentence id="2154">I was surprised that Tom Lantos, yesterday, very strong Hungarian accent, the Ambassador to the <span class="country">U.S.</span> who spoke beautiful English and Lantos couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 61 Lantos and his wife and I were at the same time, I'm assuming or within days of one another of the <span class="building">Wallenberg Houses</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2156">I met him yesterday, cold fish, didn't even try to be nice. </sentence><sentence id="2157">He's a politician on the one hand, which I understand. </sentence><sentence id="2158">On the other hand, he was not very human, stuffed shirt like. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Q.

It was pretty devastating because it was a closure which never happened with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2162">So my mother would be now in her "90s__ this is'95 she was born in "99 so it'll be impossible for her to have lived. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Q. Do you receive war reparations?A. No because I was not in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and I was not long enough in dire straits, if you will, so I never would qualify for it. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And I didn't want to lie. </sentence><sentence id="2165">I could have. </sentence><sentence id="2166">There was nobody I didn't want to lie about the fact that I was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and came back to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and then I took the <span class="dlf">Alley of Beth</span> (sic) out. </sentence><sentence id="2167">There was nobody to tell me. </sentence><sentence id="2168">I wanted it behind me essentially to the point where I always wanted a lacquer that was a photographer when I was 12 and I always wanted and I did get myself a Rolex and love to have a  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 62 <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2169">I went back to <span class="country">Germany</span> and I went back to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and I really didn't have too many problems with it, again, blocking it. </sentence><sentence id="2170">It's the Hungarians who were the worst to me but of course the German were the cause and so I couldn't hate so much of Europe not to ever travel or be there again. </sentence><sentence id="2171">I did business with Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2172">I did business with Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="2173">Just recently, I was in a <span class="building">house</span> where in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> where my host, who was a businessman, told me about the <span class="building">house</span> that there was an actress who lived up on the <span class="interior space">top floor</span>, mistress of a famous surgeon, and had Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="2174">He said Hitler came here very often, you know, and Q.

</sentence><sentence id="2194">Can't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="2195">But I mean again, it takes you back. </sentence><sentence id="2196">Everything continues to take you back and there's always some revelation. </sentence><sentence id="2197">So it's a life that was so affected and I guess what I try to do, rightly or wrongly, not to have my children grow up as children of survivors which has its own bad psychological syndrome. </sentence><sentence id="2198">They are affected by more than even a survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2199">But we went through family therapy together with my wife and so that she could understand it a little bit more, so the children can understand it, and they seem to have grown up to be _ the two boys really normal American kids with some affinity towards Judaism, <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2200">We took them back to and took them through where I went to <span class="building">school</span> and the affect was not bad on them which is good. </sentence><sentence id="2201">The children and I went back with my wife in the "80s, took them back to the <span class="building">house</span> where I was living, the <span class="building">schools</span> that I went to, and as a matter of fact, interestingly enough, Cartie, who I met at lunch, her brother went to the same <span class="building">elementary school</span> as I did. </sentence><sentence id="2202">He's evidently the same age as Iam. </sentence><sentence id="2203">Sol promised to I did get, by the way, people found and sent to me some geography pictures and my mother's cook book. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And amongst the childhood pictures are some of the class pictures from the <span class="building">elementary school</span> and a lot more including the one that's in there. </sentence><sentence id="2205">But I guess what was curious my mother taught me to be independent and take care of myself and this is the late "30s, early "40s when that was not in vogue. </sentence><sentence id="2206">She certainly came from a traditional middle European homemaker background, not professional person. </sentence><sentence id="2207">But she taught me how to sew and how to cook and how to bake, in case, in case what, you know, I ask now. </sentence><sentence id="2208">They never told me to  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 64 expect something that will happen and I don't know if they were aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="2209">But to this day, I bake from her book that she and I used to bake Saturdays cakes for Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="2210">Istill made just yesterday I finished up a <span class="spatial object">Zahar Tort</span> that is given to my sons and now to be a wife for birthdays. </sentence><sentence id="2211">It gets frozen and air shipped wherever they are. </sentence><sentence id="2212">They also cook. </sentence><sentence id="2213">They don't bake they don't have to be competitive. </sentence><sentence id="2214">They also take pictures which I did when I was 12 and I have my first picture still. </sentence><sentence id="2215">So I feel that I imparted some good things and it wasn't that bad that they didn't know early on what was happening to their father and to their family, their grandfather, their grandmother, and all their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="2216">They never had nightmares about it so I think that it worked well that they find out about it under professional guidance. </sentence><sentence id="2217">I think that was the big thing. </sentence><sentence id="2218">It may have been very difficult for them at that time but it did not affect them because the explanations were there and so there is no guilt. </sentence><sentence id="2219">One of them just married a French Canadian Catholic girl. </sentence><sentence id="2220">He's trying to wrestle with the fact that how should they bring their children up, if any. </sentence><sentence id="2221">His wife told him that she's elapsed Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="2222">His wife told him that if he really believes in Judaism and Jews and a Jewish religion and the fact he's wrestling with where I came from and what I went through, that she'll be happy to bring their kids up as Jewish and he's wrestling with it whether he should or should not. </sentence><sentence id="2223">It'll be interesting to see what happens. </sentence><sentence id="2224">Their older son married a Jewish girl and we have a grand dog at this point. </sentence><sentence id="2225">Q. Is there anything else you would like to share about what you went through?A. I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2226">Q. Any messages you'd like to leave your children?A. I think they got the messages and that was, unfortunately, in a way pessimism I call it realism that it certainly can happen again. </sentence><sentence id="2227">During McCarthy times I remember that it could have  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ivan Becker 65 easily happened again. </sentence><sentence id="2228">With some of the far right coming into vogue around the world, it could happen again. </sentence><sentence id="2229">It's certainly happening again in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> to Africa. </sentence><sentence id="2230">They should be aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="2231">They should perhaps look at people and evaluate them before they make commitments, before they entrust their lives with it with some people. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Just to go back on the Swiss passport, the Swiss papers that were being sold which we couldn't afford to buy, I testified at the guy's trial because I was not the only one who was terribly angry but there were others and I testified that we probably could have been saved. </sentence><sentence id="2233">Q. Which trial was this?A. There was a trial in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, bringing some of the people, the collaborators, or some of the people who did not help when they hindered rather than helped. </sentence><sentence id="2234">The neighbor was a Jew and he would not give us. </sentence><sentence id="2235">He wanted to sell us the <span class="spatial object">Swiss Schutz Passes</span> and so I went to <span class="building">Court</span> and I made a deposition that I was aware of that fact that he did this. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Q. When was the trial?A. It was in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2237">It never came to be because he died of a heart attack before the trial. </sentence><sentence id="2238">But I had a certain feeling of satisfaction at that point that I did something. </sentence><sentence id="2239">Q. What year was that?A. 1945, early "45.Q. Early "45?A. Early "45.Q. Could you just again go into a little bit of detail about how you got your Schutz Pass?A. It's hazy but [remember that the not the <span class="building">embassy</span> but it had to be an <span class="building">office</span> that, guessing, <span class="building">Wallenberg</span> had set up. </sentence><sentence id="2240">He <span class="building">satellite offices</span> as I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And somehow I found out about it. </sentence><sentence

not worth very much, only occasionally would they help and I just didn't need it but it was something good to have in case. </sentence><sentence id="2245">So really my closest meeting was in the <span

id="2246">I was pretty much on my own other than that. </sentence><sentence id="2247">It was very hectic and I had to make decisions whether to stay or move on or and went and then went back and still got back into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, which may have been the best thing that happened to me at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2248">Certainly, my belief in God nose dived after that and certainly couldn't understand, which is what everybody asks, how can God let this happen and there was never any answer. </sentence><sentence id="2249">The affect is ever lasting and I started talking about this to young people what I went through only very recently and I guess the reason for it is perhaps because people started asking. </sentence><sentence id="2250">My own family in <span class="country">America</span> did not have any idea what I went through. </sentence><sentence id="2251">They never asked me. </sentence><sentence id="2252">To them, it's 40 years later it's a total surprise. </sentence><sentence id="2253">My in laws never knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="2254">They knew I came out but not what came before it. </sentence><sentence id="2255">It was very touching. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Iwent Nancy's uncle was dying of cancer just recently and we have been close to them because I liked him and I liked his wife and not so much the rest of the family but he and I never talked about this and we knew that he's not going to live much longer. </sentence><sentence id="2257">So we went really to say good bye to him up in

found out and they were _ they felt better for it. </sentence><sentence id="2259">But there's no asking. </sentence><sentence id="2260">I mean, when the little girl, the 12 year old 40 years later or
