( </sentence><sentence id="248">clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming into <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">One was to get a false visa somewhere in <span class="country">Germany</span> for $165, and the other was to find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in <span class="country">America</span> would send...would send down to <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>...the famous affair of the <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the <span class="building">office</span> I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. </sentence><sentence id="251">Already the <span class="building">Joint</span> was coming in to it. </sentence><sentence id="252">Actually, the <span class="building">Joint</span> financially always was there. </sentence><sentence id="253">And...uh...they...uh...those who had legal $500 bond were allowed to <span class="dlf">land</span> and some of them were taken into <span class="building">jails</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="255">And we heard that <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole diagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the government, and that's when I called the <span class="building">JDC</span> on the phone direct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Where were you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: In <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: You joined the <span class="building">Havana office</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">Still in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">Expecting <span class="spatial object">boats</span> to come in, <span class="spatial object">ships</span> to come in with refugees and  knowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption inside of <span class="country">Cuba</span> with <span class="populated place">Batista</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. </sentence><sentence id="304">And then we heard that the next <span class="spatial object">ship</span> that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="305">See, the <span class="building">JDC</span> had <span class="building">offices</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and we were in communications like this: <span class="populated place">New York</span>, <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">And so I insisted that this is nothing which I felt I should handle alone. </sentence><sentence id="307">It was more political than social. </sentence><sentence id="308">My Spanish language didn't do any good. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh...And they did. </sentence><sentence id="310">The <span class="building">JDC</span> went down. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">And I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal lawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the <span class="building">JDC</span> who...uh...had his ends with Batista. </sentence><sentence id="312">And I don't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. </sentence><sentence id="313">and everyone knows what the <span class="dlf">S.S. St.</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="314">Louis meant. ( </sentence><sentence id="315">Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't remember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="316">Only a few could disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was stationed there and not allowed to come into the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="317">Well, the last thing we wanted was for that <span class="spatial object">boat</span>...that <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span> because that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="318">So for about a week...this is 39...uh...we in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>, <span class="populated place">JDC New York</span>, <span class="populated place">JDC Paris</span>...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you could do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could telephone. </sentence><sentence id="319">I don't think we ever went to sleep. ( </sentence><sentence id="320">laughing) Anyway, books have been written, stories been told. </sentence><sentence id="321">The S.S. did not go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">It was...disembarked in <span class="country">Holland</span>, <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">London</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="323">Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to <span class="country">Germany</span>, many of them were caught when the Germans invaded <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, and <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">But a lot of them were saved. </sentence><sentence id="326">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">And one of the things that I learned... call this my in-service training period. </sentence><sentence id="328">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the <span class="building">American Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Havana</span> trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh...<span class="building">American Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations. </sentence><sentence id="330">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. </sentence><sentence id="331">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them. </sentence><sentence id="332">There were understaffed. </sentence><sentence id="333">And so I stayed on in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>....39, 40, 41. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="334">And...uh...I...for some... liked...I liked <span class="country">Cuba</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">I liked the climate. </sentence><sentence id="336">I liked the people. </sentence><sentence id="337">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. </sentence><sentence id="338">We were helping to get people to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">But one day, one morning the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> rang. </sentence><sentence id="340">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. </sentence><sentence id="341">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?" ( </sentence><sentence id="342">laughing) "How are you doing" was not an expression in those years, but he said, "How are you?" </sentence><sentence id="343">I said, "Fine." " </sentence><sentence id="344">Busy?" " </sentence><sentence id="345">Yal, we're very busy here." </sentence><sentence id="346">Well...so...uh...he said, "How would you like to go to <span class="country">China</span>?"

class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="694">It was a old <span class="building">school house</span> that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="695">And...uh...I got into a <span class="interior space">room</span> with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the <span class="interior space">room</span> was to see at the very end there were <span class="dlf">windows</span> going...getting out to the <span class="building">campus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">It was an old <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="697">It had a beautiful <span class="building">campus</span>, and I quickly took my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and dumped it in that <span class="region">area</span> so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the <span class="building">campus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="698">That was the first thing I thought of. </sentence><sentence id="699">Anyway, it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="700">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an <span class="spatial object">oven</span>...<span class="spatial object">stoves</span>, and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="701">We never burned them again. </sentence><sentence id="702">We just put on more clothes. </sentence><sentence id="703">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think. </sentence><sentence id="704">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old <span class="populated place">Shanghailanders</span> that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="705">But that's something I've never had. </sentence><sentence id="706">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything. </sentence><sentence id="707">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention. </sentence><sentence id="708">They gave us everything that was due to us. </sentence><sentence id="709">They brought in the food. </sentence><sentence id="710">We had to cook it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="711">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized. </sentence><sentence id="712">Put up your committees. </sentence><sentence id="713">Do what you like. </sentence><sentence id="714">We'll bring in the food. </sentence><sentence id="715">And organize your own social activities. </sentence><sentence id="716">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising." </sentence><sentence id="717">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="718">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience." </sentence><sentence id="719">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience. </sentence><sentence id="720">I am a number. </sentence><sentence id="721">I have a number. </sentence><sentence id="722">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. </sentence><sentence id="723">I don't want to have anything to do with all this. </sentence><sentence id="724">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. </sentence><sentence id="725">So I made a very quick ____ as we say. </sentence><sentence id="726">I...uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I took <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> duty. </sentence><sentence id="727">And...uh...the other thing was...oh...the <span class="populated place">camp</span>...there was <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> all around the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="728">And out there were <span class="dlf">fields</span>, and we were supposed to grow are own vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="729">And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...is very important for me. </sentence><sentence id="730">So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="731">And that worked very well. </sentence><sentence id="732">But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting sick. </sentence><sentence id="733">And that's natural in all of <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to the <span class="building">hospitals</span>, diarrhea and all that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="735">And...uh...nothing was happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="736">I was as healthy as a horse. </sentence><sentence id="737">But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the collective. </sentence><sentence id="738">So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't going to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="739">But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my Sarah Burnhart act. </sentence><sentence id="740">And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> who was an  2 American doctor. </sentence><sentence id="741">And he gave me a permit to get out to the <span class="building">hospital</span> because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="742">And I got out to the...uh...<span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="743">It was a <span class="building">English hospital</span> and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the <span class="building">hospital</span> and he remembered me from...from contacts we had before <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">And they put me in a <span class="interior space">ward</span>, and when he came to make his rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter what he did, I was in good shape. </sentence><sentence id="745">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things. </sentence><sentence id="746">You shouldn't be in a ward. </sentence><sentence id="747">I can get you a private <span class="interior space">room</span>, but if you want a private <span class="interior space">room</span> you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to <span class="country">Japan</span> for permission. </sentence><sentence id="748">But I can give you a <span class="interior space">room</span> with another lady on my own responsibility." </sentence><sentence id="749">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the <span class="interior space">room</span> with the lady." </sentence><sentence id="750">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the <span class="building">German bank</span> in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and he used to come to visit her every day. </sentence><sentence id="751">And I had no right for visitors. </sentence><sentence id="752">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors. </sentence><sentence id="753">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?" </sentence><sentence id="754">And that's the way I saw Mr. Bitker. </sentence><sentence id="755">I saw my friends. </sentence><sentence id="756">I got...I got the message out. </sentence><sentence id="757">And...uh...I was there for 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="758">They kept me out in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and then came August...July, August 43. </sentence><sentence id="759">Right? </sentence><sentence id="760">And...uh...<span class="country">Italy</span> surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the <span class="building">Swiss Consulate</span> because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens." </sentence><sentence id="761">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. </sentence><sentence id="762">So I'm going to release you now. </sentence><sentence id="763">You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be re...on that...on that <span class="building">exchange</span>. </sentence><sentence id="764">Your name is on it." </sentence><sentence id="765">He said I also found out that your name was on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off because they needed you. ( </sentence><sentence id="766">Laughing) So I went back. </sentence><sentence id="767">Before I went back, I sw <span class="building">Bitker</span> once. </sentence><sentence id="768">For the last time! </sentence><sentence id="769">And I got a...because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...in the name of the <span class="building">JDC</span> to repay. </sentence><sentence id="770">And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know. </sentence><sentence id="771">So I said, "Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="772">Just give me a...uh...up to date account of what the situation is financially so I can get it back to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="773">Well, he gave me the whole accounting up-to-date. </sentence><sentence id="774">When we were prepared in our <span class="populated place">camp</span>...that was September 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go ona <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="776">I had always these figures, and I took toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before they...before we were left to go. </sentence><sentence id="777">And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper. </sentence><sentence id="778">I wrote every piece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my panties, so that...uh...it was invisible and... uh...started packing. </sentence><sentence id="779">And in September 43, I forget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our <span class="populated place">camp</span> and from other <span class="populated place">camps</span> were taken on a...to go on a <span class="spatial object">Japanese ship</span> as far as <span class="populated place">Goa</span> where the exchange would take place. </sentence><sentence id="780">That was in...it was <span class="populated place">Portugese Goa</span> which was part of the <span class="region">Indian mainland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="781">And...uh...we got on that <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="782">It was...uh...a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>...a <span class="spatial object">Japanese ship</span> which had a passenger capacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we picked up people on the way. </sentence><sentence id="783">And what they gave us women were...uh...like <span class="interior space">stalls</span> hat you put horses on and <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="784">And the <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> were full of fleas. </sentence><sentence id="785">So the first...the first night we took all our <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> (laughing)  3 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: The first...uh...night...we tried to sleep with those fleas, but we couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="921">We took...all of us women, took all the

course, we had the smorgasbord and we had a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span>, and then we started with the _Gripsholm. </sentence><sentence id="932">From there on, it was all the way

to send money through <span class="country">Switzerland</span> to Mr. Bitker. </sentence><sentence id="958">And so we went to the <span class="building">Treasury</span> and I...we had a long session with Morganthal, and gave him the whole story of how it's working. </sentence><sentence id="959">And he had one question. </sentence><sentence id="960">Are the Japanese getting any of this money? </sentence><sentence id="961">And I said, "Not a penny. </sentence><sentence id="962">It's all in the hands of the Bitker Committee," and I said, "This is what is keeping the 8,000 people we are
