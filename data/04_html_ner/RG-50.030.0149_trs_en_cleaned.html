<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: At what point did you become involved with the...with the <span class="building">Joint</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, the <span class="spatial object">Joint</span> comes much later. </sentence><sentence id="130">I'll tell you first..-uh...after a couple of years of that in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, the same restlessness showed up. </sentence><sentence id="131">And I heard that there was a job in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span>, <span class="region">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">In fact, I was told that there was a job and they were looking for a Director of  their Jewish welfare work. </sentence><sentence id="133">I went down for an interview. </sentence><sentence id="134">This was already in the 30s. </sentence><sentence id="135">And I was hired. </sentence><sentence id="136">So I left <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, and that's the first time I ever left my parents" <span class="building">home</span>, and was on my own. </sentence><sentence id="137">And...uh...started working for the Jewish wel...became...became actually the Director of the Jewish Welfare Society of <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span>, <span class="region">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">It took a long time to set up a good welfare service there which would be accept...where students would be accepted by the...uh... <span class="building">University of Buffalo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">It took me about 4 years to do that job. </sentence><sentence id="140">I liked <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span> very much. </sentence><sentence id="141">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was settled there. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then one day I got a telephone call from <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">19...Christmas 1938. </sentence><sentence id="145">And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>, head of the...uh...not Joint at that point...it was the...uh...<span class="building">Jewish Refugee Service</span> because already Hitler was in. </sentence><sentence id="146">Refugees were coming in in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later. </sentence><sentence id="147">They were people who had means. </sentence><sentence id="148">Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> in time and got out. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we were receiving them in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span> like in other <span class="populated place">communities</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the telephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working together with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="151">And she said to me she had heard from somewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>, <span class="country">Cuba</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">Refugees were beginning to flee from <span class="country">Germany</span> and from other <span class="country">countries</span> in Europe, and...uh...the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> were coming in, but there were problems in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">The money at that point was being given by the <span class="building">JDC</span>, but the <span class="building">JDC</span> didn't have the official...uh...it was working together with the <span class="building">National Refugee Service</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">I didn't even know that I was a employ...employed by the <span class="building">Joint</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="155">And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to, with my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple problems down in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to <span class="populated place">Havana</span> and look over the picture and be helpful? </sentence><sentence id="157">Also with...because of my language abilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was the time of Batista. ( </sentence><sentence id="159">clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming into <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">One was to get a false visa somewhere in <span class="country">Germany</span> for $165, and the other was to find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in <span class="country">America</span> would send...would send down to <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>...the famous affair of the <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the <span class="building">office</span> I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. </sentence><sentence id="162">Already the <span class="building">Joint</span> was coming in to it. </sentence><sentence id="163">Actually, the <span class="building">Joint</span> financially always was there. </sentence><sentence id="164">And...uh...they...uh...those who had legal $500 bond were allowed to <span class="dlf">land</span> and some of them were taken into <span class="building">jails</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="166">And we heard that <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole diagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the government, and that's when I called the <span class="building">JDC</span> on the phone direct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Where were you at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: In <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: You joined the <span class="building">Havana office</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Still in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">Expecting <span class="spatial object">boats</span> to come in, <span class="spatial object">ships</span> to come in with refugees and  knowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption inside of <span class="country">Cuba</span> with <span class="populated place">Batista</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. </sentence><sentence id="215">And then we heard that the next <span class="spatial object">ship</span> that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="216">See, the <span class="building">JDC</span> had <span class="building">offices</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and we were in communications like this: <span class="populated place">New York</span>, <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And so I insisted that this is nothing which I felt I should handle alone. </sentence><sentence id="218">It was more political than social. </sentence><sentence id="219">My Spanish language didn't do any good. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh...And they did. </sentence><sentence id="221">The <span class="building">JDC</span> went down. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">And I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal lawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the <span class="building">JDC</span> who...uh...had his ends with Batista. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I don't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. </sentence><sentence id="224">and everyone knows what the <span class="dlf">S.S. St.</span> </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">Louis meant. ( </sentence><sentence id="226">Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't remember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">Only a few could disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was stationed there and not allowed to come into the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">Well, the last thing we wanted was for that <span class="spatial object">boat</span>...that <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span> because that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="229">So for about a week...this is 39...uh...we in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>, <span class="populated place">JDC New York</span>, <span class="populated place">JDC Paris</span>...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you could do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could telephone. </sentence><sentence id="230">I don't think we ever went to sleep. ( </sentence><sentence id="231">laughing) Anyway, books have been written, stories been told. </sentence><sentence id="232">The S.S. did not go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was...disembarked in <span class="country">Holland</span>, <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="populated place">London</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="234">Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to <span class="country">Germany</span>, many of them were caught when the Germans invaded <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, and <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">But a lot of them were saved. </sentence><sentence id="237">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">And one of the things that I learned... call this my in-service training period. </sentence><sentence id="239">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the <span class="building">American Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Havana</span> trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh...<span class="building">American Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations. </sentence><sentence id="241">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. </sentence><sentence id="242">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them. </sentence><sentence id="243">There were understaffed. </sentence><sentence id="244">And so I stayed on in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>....39, 40, 41. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">And...uh...I...for some... liked...I liked <span class="country">Cuba</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">I liked the climate. </sentence><sentence id="247">I liked the people. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. </sentence><sentence id="249">We were helping to get people to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">But one day, one morning the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> rang. </sentence><sentence id="251">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. </sentence><sentence id="252">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?" ( </sentence><sentence id="253">laughing) "How are you doing" was not an expression in those years, but he said, "How are you?" </sentence><sentence id="254">I said, "Fine." " </sentence><sentence id="255">Busy?" " </sentence><sentence id="256">Yal, we're very busy here." </sentence><sentence id="257">Well...so...uh...he said, "How would you like to go to <span class="country">China</span>?" ( </sentence><sentence id="258">Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it. </sentence><sentence id="259">I said, "<span class="country">China</span>? </sentence><sentence id="260">Where in <span class="country">China</span>?" " </sentence><sentence id="261"><span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>." </sentence><sentence id="262">I said, "Oh, Yal. </sentence><sentence id="263">Sure. </sentence><sentence id="264">I'd like to go." ( </sentence><sentence id="265">Laughing) I had no idea what he was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="266">I said, "What's the problem?" </sentence><sentence id="267">He said, "Well, we've been...first of all we've had a request from the <span class="building">State Department</span> that you should go to <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="268">You should go to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Because refugees are pouring in from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">It's a open <span class="dlf">port</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271"> No visas are necessary. </sentence><sentence id="272">The Chinese don't care who comes in. </sentence><sentence id="273">We've been sending money to a Jewish committee of local leaders there and..uh...the <span class="building">Embassy</span> is swamped. </sentence><sentence id="274">The <span class="building">Consulate</span> is swamped. </sentence><sentence id="275">The <span class="building">Embassy</span> was in <span class="populated place">Peking</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="276">The <span class="building">Embassy</span> needs help. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="277">The...uh...the <span class="building">State Department</span> doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and so...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">Will you go?" </sentence><sentence id="279">I said, "Alright, I'll go." ( </sentence><sentence id="280">Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever make. </sentence><sentence id="281">Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="282">Nothing was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="283">The <span class="building">Embassy</span>...the <span class="building">Consulate</span> was swamped. </sentence><sentence id="284">There was refugees there who had visas, valid visas that the <span class="country">U.S.</span> was ready for accept for their coming to the <span class="country">United States</span>, but there was no personnel. </sentence><sentence id="285">So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I got there, in <span class="populated place">41</span>...much later in <span class="populated place">41</span>, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands and thousands of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="286">The situation as very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I wasn't supposed to do much about that. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was supposed to help the <span class="building">Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat) different from the way we travel now...uh...it took...1 went over on the first <span class="spatial object">Pan American clipper</span> that ever trans...that ever sailed in the <span class="env feature">Pacific</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">It took 5 days and 4 nights. </sentence><sentence id="291">But it was very much more civilized than the way we travel now. </sentence><sentence id="292">Anyway, my...my...I had to get to <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="293">I couldn't get to <span class="country">China</span> on...on a <span class="spatial object">Pan American</span>, and I had to wait for a whole week in <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span> before I could get a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> up the <span class="region">coast</span> to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">And when I got there my first...first place I went to as the <span class="building">embassy</span>...the <span class="building">Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">They gave me an <span class="building">office</span>, and I began interviewing, helping them. </sentence><sentence id="296">But at the same time I had to get to know the <span class="building">Jewish community structure</span> there of local residents. </sentence><sentence id="297">The chairman was an ex-Dutchman called Spillman, very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="298">And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC money to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding. </sentence><sentence id="299">So...uh...all this was done with JDC money. </sentence><sentence id="300">I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that someone from the <span class="building">Joint</span> was there. </sentence><sentence id="301">I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming to my <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among the refugees and how it was being handled. </sentence><sentence id="303">All of it went through the <span class="spatial object">pouch</span>, and L...very soon...it took me a month. </sentence><sentence id="304">In June...I got there in May...in June I issued a definite ultimatum to the <span class="building">JDC</span> in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one- man job. </sentence><sentence id="305">They would have to send out someone else to work with me. </sentence><sentence id="306">And I knew...I knew that Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span> who was working with me in <span class="populated place">Havana</span>, always said he'd like to come out. </sentence><sentence id="307">So I said, "Either you send Manny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone. </sentence><sentence id="308">Or else I'll come <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="309">In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued. </sentence><sentence id="310">I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I think it was...the...the exact date isn't important. </sentence><sentence id="311">I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans had walked into the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="313">So I got a cable from the <span class="building">JDC</span> a few days after that saying, "In case communications are cut, you are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is required to take care of the needy" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>; we had a <span

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="535"> A; Yes. </sentence><sentence id="536">Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we took over the program in <span class="populated place">Hong Q</span> and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people. </sentence><sentence id="537">And we also set up an entirely new committee. </sentence><sentence id="538">The committee which where...which I found when I originally came to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, most of them had already been interned by the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="539">They weren't around anymore. </sentence><sentence id="540">And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust. </sentence><sentence id="541">And gradually while on the one hand we were working in <span class="populated place">Hong Q</span> and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the <span class="building">hospital</span> and the money ad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee, voluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be able to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens. </sentence><sentence id="542">And we got a very good committee. </sentence><sentence id="543">Very, very good <span class="building">committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">Many of them had been...uh...there for many years. </sentence><sentence id="545">Russians who had fled the revolution and who had made their <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and who were very fine community leaders and whom we could trust. </sentence><sentence id="546">And the...the one committee that we set up, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt very secure in giving him power of attorney after...if anything should happen to us to ensure that part. </sentence><sentence id="547">Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh...the old <span class="interior space">kitchens</span> that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very old <span class="interior space">Chinese kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="549">And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was going...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="550">So what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="551">Then we heard that one day that out in the <span class="region">French concession</span> of <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>, there were some new <span class="spatial object">boilers</span> that had just arrived the day before <span class="region">Pearl Harbor</span> and were standing there...uh...assigned to the <span class="building">Sassoon Company</span>, but were never used. </sentence><sentence id="552">So I went up to the <span class="building">Sassoon Company</span>, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for permission and they said, "We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a British company, can't give you that permission. </sentence><sentence id="553">We're as much enemy aliens as you are." </sentence><sentence id="554">So what did we do? </sentence><sentence id="555">We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at those...uh...<span class="spatial object">boilers</span> and said, "Laura, you've got to get them." </sentence><sentence id="556">So one night when it was dark and...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> all the time and the...and the <span class="spatial object">rickshaws</span> were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="557">We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the <span class="region">French concession</span> and we highjacked the two big (laughing) <span class="spatial object">boilers</span>, and brought them through the masses of people going into the...buzzing around in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="558">Nobody was paying any attention to us. </sentence><sentence id="559">Taking them over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and we got them to Hong Q. And from that point on, we built a new <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> which was really giving nutrition and we burned up the old <span class="interior space">kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">That's one of our fun stories. </sentence><sentence id="561">Anyway, it got to be around the end of...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by radio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all enemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment. </sentence><sentence id="562">You would be allowed to take in anything you like to your <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="563">They didn't tell us which <span class="populated place">camp</span> at that point. </sentence><sentence id="564">Your <span class="spatial object">beds</span>,  1 your...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in. </sentence><sentence id="565">Food...this is...they were beginning to prepare us. </sentence><sentence id="566">And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in <span class="populated place">Paoting</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">I had not received a notice yet. </sentence><sentence id="568">So we packed him off, and a month later I got notice. </sentence><sentence id="569">And...uh...I actually took my own <span class="spatial object">folding bed</span> and my own <span class="spatial object">mattress</span> and...and...uh....a <span class="spatial object">trunk</span> full of canned goods and stuff and things and...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race. </sentence><sentence id="570">It's a...an interesting group of people. </sentence><sentence id="571">Uh... They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> of couples, and single men and single women outside of <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">Right now the name of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> escapes me, but it isn't important. </sentence><sentence id="573">It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="574">We got to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> which, of course, was surrounded by <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575">It was a old <span class="building">school house</span> that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="576">And...uh...I got into a <span class="interior space">room</span> with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the <span class="interior space">room</span> was to see at the very end there were <span class="dlf">windows</span> going...getting out to the <span class="building">campus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">It was an old <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="578">It had a beautiful <span class="building">campus</span>, and I quickly took my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and dumped it in that <span class="region">area</span> so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the <span class="building">campus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">That was the first thing I thought of. </sentence><sentence id="580">Anyway, it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="581">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an <span class="spatial object">oven</span>...<span class="spatial object">stoves</span>, and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="582">We never burned them again. </sentence><sentence id="583">We just put on more clothes. </sentence><sentence id="584">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think. </sentence><sentence id="585">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old <span class="populated place">Shanghailanders</span> that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="586">But that's something I've never had. </sentence><sentence id="587">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything. </sentence><sentence id="588">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention. </sentence><sentence id="589">They gave us everything that was due to us. </sentence><sentence id="590">They brought in the food. </sentence><sentence id="591">We had to cook it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="592">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized. </sentence><sentence id="593">Put up your committees. </sentence><sentence id="594">Do what you like. </sentence><sentence id="595">We'll bring in the food. </sentence><sentence id="596">And organize your own social activities. </sentence><sentence id="597">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising." </sentence><sentence id="598">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was that I was there. </sentence><sentence id="599">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience." </sentence><sentence id="600">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience. </sentence><sentence id="601">I am a number. </sentence><sentence id="602">I have a number. </sentence><sentence id="603">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. </sentence><sentence id="604">I don't want to have anything to do with all this. </sentence><sentence id="605">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. </sentence><sentence id="606">So I made 9 <span class="spatial object">verv</span> quick as we sav. </sentence><sentence id="607">1. </sentence><sentence id="608">uh_ realized that when vou're near the food. </sentence><sentence id="609">it's important so 7  2 <span class="building">American doctor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="610">And he gave me a permit to get out to the <span class="building">hospital</span> because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I got out to the...uh...<span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="612">It was a <span class="building">English hospital</span> and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the <span

</sentence><sentence id="614">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things. </sentence><sentence id="615">You shouldn't be in a ward. </sentence><sentence id="616">I can get you a private <span class="interior space">room</span>, but if you want a private <span class="interior space">room</span> you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to <span

</sentence><sentence id="618">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the <span class="interior space">room</span> with the lady." </sentence><sentence id="619">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the <span class="building">German bank</span> in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and he used to come to visit her every day. </sentence><sentence id="620">And I had no right for visitors. </sentence><sentence id="621">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors. </sentence><sentence id="622">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?" </sentence><sentence id="623">And that's the way I saw Mr.

</sentence><sentence id="627">They kept me out in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and then came August...July, August 43. </sentence><sentence id="628">Right? </sentence><sentence id="629">And...uh...<span class="country">Italy</span> surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the <span class="building">Swiss Consulate</span> because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens." </sentence><sentence id="630">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. </sentence><sentence id="631">So I'm going to release you now.
