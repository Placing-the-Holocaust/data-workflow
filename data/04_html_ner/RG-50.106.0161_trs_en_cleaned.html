<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: When you think back to your childhood, can you remember any personal experiences that you had with anti-Semitism in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, things began to boil up very quickly after Hitler took power. </sentence><sentence id="18">The people who owned the <span class="building">house</span> in which we rented an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, their o -- late teens to early 20's sons were among the first je -- to join the party. </sentence><sentence id="19">They paraded around in their brown shirts. </sentence><sentence id="20">Some of the children in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> joined the <span class="building">Hitlerjugend</span>, the Hitler Youth. </sentence><sentence id="21">And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down. </sentence><sentence id="22">We lived on the corner of a main <span class="dlf">street</span>, and the spectacle of the parades up and down with the flags, the music, the torches, and get away from that <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">The atmosphere of fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
