</sentence><sentence id="175">And they started to separate us, so the men stayed together, the women together. </sentence><sentence id="176">We were young and we stayed near my mother and my sister, and right away when the officer came and they cut us off, thinking and being assured that we see each other later, you know. </sentence><sentence id="177">And then we started to march, and we got into the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was very, very horrible. </sentence><sentence id="179">We didn't know where we are or what it is. </sentence><sentence id="180">We just -- big SS soldiers with the dogs near us. </sentence><sentence id="181">And they took us to a <span class="building">sauna</span>, and I didn't see my mother anymore, but my sister was with me. </sentence><sentence id="182">And they took us in and they told us to take everything off. </sentence><sentence id="183">We were very embarrassed, very young, and just couldn't do it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="184">And we had our pocketbook, and in the <span class="spatial object">pocketbooks</span> was very important, our papers, our identities. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I remember I had a little chain on my neck with a picture in it. </sentence><sentence id="186">And we were standing there, and the SS men came with the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="187">And one of the SS men -- no, as matter of fact, it was not an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="188">It was a young girl from <span class="country">Slovakia</span> who were already the <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">And she said, "You don't need that," and took it off from my neck. </sentence><sentence id="190">This fell and I wanted to pick it up, this was very dear to me. </sentence><sentence id="191">And then one of the soldiers with the big boots, then I looked up and there was the dog and the soldier. </sentence><sentence id="192">I never saw that again. </sentence><sentence id="193">Again, but this was not so important than the identity card. </sentence><sentence id="194">And we both looked at each other, and my sister said, "What we will do? </sentence><sentence id="195">What will we do without them?" </sentence><sentence id="196">Anyway, when we went to another <span class="dlf">corner</span> and they started to cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="197">They cut our hair and -- you know, it was just unbelievable one part of my hair came down. </sentence><sentence id="198">The other part of my hair came down. </sentence><sentence id="199">And till I got out, my head was like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="200">We don't know anything, and we just didn't know where to put our hands. </sentence><sentence id="201">We were so ashamed and embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="202">And let me not cry. </sentence><sentence id="203">And then we went to another <span class="interior space">room</span>, and they gave us -- they gave us to put on, it was made from -- it was like a dress, you know. </sentence><sentence id="204">Gray. </sentence><sentence id="205">I don't know what

yes, I forget to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="208">When we came after the <span class="interior space">sauna</span>, after we were cleaned and cleaned, you know, after they had -- we find our shoes. </sentence><sentence id="209">It was a lot of shoes there, and my sister and I, we looked. </sentence><sentence id="210">When we left, we put them in a <span class="interior space">corner</span>, so when we came out we saw the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="211">And this was lifesaving situation, you know, to have your own shoes. </sentence><sentence id="212">Anyway, yeah, they put us in <span class="populated place">925</span>, I was always near my sister and my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="213">We started to march, and there's hundreds of women and hundreds of people, it was incredible looks to see something like that. </sentence><sentence id="214">But when we started to march mainly an SS man with a big  German dog, and outside where already the other prisoners were standing in a <span class="dlf">line</span> and seeing us coming in. </sentence><sentence id="215">And I was marching and I was crying, and one of the people, one of the women screamed to me, "Don't cry, you cry. </sentence><sentence id="216">You cannot cry here. </sentence><sentence id="217">You are not supposed to cry here." </sentence><sentence id="218">I don't remember the face, but it was a young girl, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="219">But she screamed at me, and she said, "Don't you ever do that." </sentence><sentence id="220">To , you know there's an expression in German. </sentence><sentence id="221">And I never cried after that for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="222">When we came to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, we were looking for our parents. </sentence><sentence id="223">And they were already the <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>, and they said, "Move, move. </sentence><sentence id="224">You have to arrange yourselves." </sentence><sentence id="225">And we said, "Where should we move? </sentence><sentence id="226">We wait for our parents." " </sentence><sentence id="227">Your parents, what are you talking?Your parents are dead." </sentence><sentence id="228">And they showed us the <span class="dlf">chimneys</span>, and we said to them, "Are you crazy?" </sentence><sentence id="229">And we were so sure that they want just to give us back that we still <span class="building">home</span> and they were already such a long time there. </sentence><sentence id="230">And then we went in in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and we got in our <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, you know, and we got to be arranged. </sentence><sentence id="231">I will make it short, and then come back to that. </sentence><sentence id="232">And in the beginning we were not so lucky, then we had the place on the bottom and it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="233">The rats and mouse and dirty. </sentence><sentence id="234">Then later on when they moved us, we got already on the top, and this was okay. </sentence><sentence id="235">It was tolerable. </sentence><sentence id="236">And then we stayed about like that in what do you call that? , </sentence><sentence id="237">a couple of weeks, till they adjusted. </sentence><sentence id="238">We got adjusted, and you probably know already from so many other interviews, the <span class="spatial object">zahlappell</span>, the getting up in the night. </sentence><sentence id="239">The 3 o'clock coffee and then a piece of bread and then -- you know the other stories from other people probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>

place. </sentence><sentence id="625">And we just heard the screaming: mother from daughter; sister from sister. </sentence><sentence id="626">It was a terrible, terrible frightening situation. </sentence><sentence id="627">Still we were not sure that we will go. </sentence><sentence id="628">And when we march, we saw the <span class="spatial object">train</span> already there, that <span

here." </sentence><sentence id="637">And then one SS man, it was not an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="638">It was a Verma (ph), a young man who came in, and who said to them, "Don't get upset. </sentence><sentence id="639">Sit down. </sentence><sentence id="640">Find your place." </sentence><sentence id="641">He came and gave everyone a piece of bread with margarine, the Verma (ph). </sentence><sentence id="642">And he said to us, "Be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="643">You don't know if you go or you're to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="644">You will know you are almost safe when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> will move." </sentence><sentence id="645">And that made them little bit, you know, quiet waiting the <span class="spatial object">train</span> should move. </sentence><sentence id="646">And after a while, it really moved. </sentence><sentence id="647">And we went -- I don't remember how long -- we went to <span
