</sentence><sentence id="511">And we knew when the <span class="spatial object">orchestra</span> is taken - - is off, then they must take us away, too. </sentence><sentence id="512">And that happened. </sentence><sentence id="513">The next day we stayed in the <span class="dlf">zahlappell</span> in the big place, and they said we are not supposed to go back to our <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">We all go to the <span class="interior space">sauna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">And we went, we gave up our clothes; we gave up our shoes. </sentence><sentence

and -- but, you know, we didn't think this was our end. </sentence><sentence id="523">Somehow we didn't, you know, believe it. </sentence><sentence id="524">And then after a while, we had the <span class="spatial object">sauna</span> and we started going out from the <span class="spatial object">sauna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525">And we are getting our stuff back, you know. </sentence><sentence id="526">We were saved, we were singing. </sentence><sentence id="527">And we had to go to selection, you know. </sentence><sentence id="528">So one <span

</sentence><sentence id="530">You know, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="531">They were taken away right away. </sentence><sentence id="532">And my sister went through, my friend went through and I came. </sentence><sentence id="533">And when I came Mengele was on the commission, you know. </sentence><sentence id="534">Mengele, another doctor, another nurse, you know, were a group who selected who should stay and who should go. </sentence><sentence id="535">We didn't know where we go or we go, but Mengele stopped me and hold me, you know, with my hand. </sentence><sentence id="536">And started to turn me, he wanted to see me. </sentence><sentence id="537">Meanwhile, the doctor spoke to him, and he turned around to answer her. </sentence><sentence id="538">And when he turned around, I run. </sentence><sentence id="539">And meanwhile the others came. </sentence><sentence id="540">Otherwise, I wouldn't tell you none of the stories, probably. </sentence><sentence

place. </sentence><sentence id="543">And we just heard the screaming: mother from daughter; sister from sister. </sentence><sentence id="544">It was a terrible, terrible frightening situation. </sentence><sentence id="545">Still we were not sure that we will go. </sentence><sentence id="546">And when we march, we saw the <span class="spatial object">train</span> already there, that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="547">And we went, the group was always tried to be together. </sentence><sentence id="548">I'm almost finished. </sentence><sentence

here." </sentence><sentence id="555">And then one SS man, it was not an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="556">It was a Verma (ph), a young man who came in, and who said to them, "Don't get upset. </sentence><sentence id="557">Sit down. </sentence><sentence id="558">Find your place." </sentence><sentence id="559">He came and gave everyone a piece of bread with margarine, the Verma (ph). </sentence><sentence id="560">And he said to us, "Be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="561">You don't know if you go or you're to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="562">You will know you are almost safe when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> will move." </sentence><sentence id="563">And that made them little bit, you know, quiet waiting the <span class="spatial object">train</span> should move. </sentence><sentence id="564">And after a while, it really moved. </sentence><sentence id="565">And we went -- I don't remember how long -- we went to <span
