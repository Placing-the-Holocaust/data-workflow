<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: David, we are going to start. </sentence><sentence id="4">And I would like for you to give us your full name, where you were born and when you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is David Bergman, spelled B-E-R-G-M-A-N. And I was born in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="env feature">Carpathian Mountains</span> called <span class="populated place">Bochov</span>." </sentence><sentence id="8">It... at that time when I was born, it belonged to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">Was a province of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">And I was born on May 3rd, 1931. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="16">Can you give us some of your recollections of your early childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Well, the early childhood was a very happy life for me and my family. </sentence><sentence id="20">I had a younger brother, older sister, mother, father, grandparents; and we were very close knit family. </sentence><sentence id="21">My father was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="22">And uh...he made suits for people coming from other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">We had one of the biggest <span class="building">tailor shops</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">And my mother, who was a seamstress, made the shirts. </sentence><sentence id="25">And I was just busy running around having a good time. </sentence><sentence id="26">And that we had uh what's considered here...it's a beautiful <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">We had...uh we didn't, I should say, have the comforts like in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">We didn't have running water. </sentence><sentence id="29">We didn't have...uh central heating. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had <span class="spatial object">stove</span> from heating, for heating; and uh for the <span class="env feature">water</span>, we had a <span class="dlf">well</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And the <span class="building">outhouse</span> was in the back of the <span class="building">house</span> several hundred feet. </sentence><sentence id="32">So I...where I lived, I considered that normal.(Laughing) I didn't think that you're supposed to have these kind of conveniences. </sentence><sentence id="33">So we didn't uh...uh think that there should be any other way. </sentence><sentence id="34">And uh...my...uh I went both to <span class="building">cheder</span> and <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">Now uh actually when I started <span class="building">school</span> was really...is when the first uh--say in "39--the first sensing of the beginning of what anti-Semitism is really like. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I remember, it was on a Saturday once. </sentence><sentence id="37">And that's after the Hungarians marched in. </sentence><sentence id="38">The Hungarians, until 1939 that <span class="region">province</span> was under <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> rule. </sentence><sentence id="39">And we had a Czech officer. </sentence><sentence id="40">We had a <span class="building">two-family home</span>; he lived on the lower <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">And all of a sudden, he disappeared just like that. </sentence><sentence id="42">Just like over night. </sentence><sentence id="43">And the Hungarians just marched in. </sentence><sentence id="44">And we were forced to...uh pledge allegiance to the new Hungarian regime. </sentence><sentence id="45">And as soon as they walked in, within a few days...I happened to be on a Saturday at my grandfather's place; and he had a eruv. </sentence><sentence id="46">I don't know if you know; a <span class="dlf">eruv</span> is a <span class="dlf">guide wire</span> that sets a <span class="dlf">perimeter</span> as far as we can walk on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="47">And the first thing they did is, they came with a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and ripped off that <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">So that was the first harassment that I actually seen by the Hungarian Nazis--showing their muscles, really, what they can do. </sentence><sentence id="49">And then afterwards, we were told that we could no longer go into  <span class="building">cheder</span>, legally. </sentence><sentence id="50">That was forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="51">So we had to go illegally. </sentence><sentence id="52">And then we would have a look out for the police. </sentence><sentence id="53">So we'd take turns. </sentence><sentence id="54">Whenever the police came, they always were in pair. </sentence><sentence id="55">They had their green hats and a little feather on their head like, so they were recognizable from a distance. </sentence><sentence id="56">So as soon as they...we saw them coming, we get a signal-- "Disperse!" </sentence><sentence id="57">And we would run; and "til it was all clear. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then we would resume again. </sentence><sentence id="59">And we sort of accepted that that's a way of life. </sentence><sentence id="60">We didn't question the parents who they were, why they're doing it. </sentence><sentence id="61">That's the way it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: This was in 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: And then what do you remember immediately after that? </sentence><sentence id="112">Let's say in the..."40, early "40s. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Well, then afterwards it started to...for...tightened, I guess use the word "tighten" the <span class="spatial object">noose</span> more. </sentence><sentence id="116">They next step they did is, they took the licenses away of people--professional--of practicing their business. </sentence><sentence id="117">Like I had a cousin who was a dentist, and he was not allowed to practice dentistry anymore. </sentence><sentence id="118">We were supposed... We were forced to go secretly. </sentence><sentence id="119">So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding, then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave. </sentence><sentence id="120">Because if they would have caught me, seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist, then they would have punished him and me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How big a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> did you have there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: There were about 3,000 Jewish in that...and then about 7,000 Christians in that <span class="region">area</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="130">My father was allowed to keep the <span class="building">store</span>, because for some reason that I can't remember--I was about 10 or 11 at the time--is because we had Czech citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="131">So they allowed those with Czech citizenship to keep the <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">But those of Hungarian, they took away. </sentence><sentence id="133">Why? </sentence><sentence id="134">L..I..[ wasn't old enough there to understand. </sentence><sentence id="135">In fact, we were really such...lived in such an isolated <span class="region">area</span> that the news would come from a drummer. </sentence><sentence id="136">We have a drummer coming like old time and beating on the <span class="dlf">door</span>; and we would all run out toward the <span class="dlf">square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">And then he would take out a piece of paper, and that's how we got our news. </sentence><sentence id="138">So we never really realized that anything can happen. </sentence><sentence id="139">I heard things--events--happening, but I could not relate to what was going around the world at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="152">So then what happen subsequently? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, afterwards...then my father was drafted into the Hungarian Army. </sentence><sentence id="154">And this was a very, very dramatic experience for us, having him away, because we were so close knit. </sentence><sentence id="155">And then he was uh gone for a year. </sentence><sentence id="156">And then they gave him a furlough. </sentence><sentence id="157">And while he was gone, because I was the oldest in the family I was considered man of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, This was about 11. </sentence><sentence id="159">I had to go on night guard with an older person. </sentence><sentence id="160">And they gave us a stick in the hand. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had no idea what this was all about, but we had to walk around the <span class="dlf">perimeter</span> to looking in case some saboteurs would come. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh, and uh I...I still wonder why should they take somebody my age. </sentence><sentence id="163">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="164">If somebody wanted to be a saboteur, do something, I'd run the other way. </sentence><sentence id="165">But you learned not to question. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a sense...you sense that they have the power, and you have to obey and you have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then...uh later on, we continued...uh a life. </sentence><sentence id="168">We missed our father very much, and continued going secretly to <span class="building">cheder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">And then we saw deportations begin. </sentence><sentence id="170">They...they uh ...took certain people--let's say the Hungarian nationality--first. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I had no idea what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="172">My parents never really talked to me about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="173">And all I saw is people marching away towards the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">And this was yet "42, in that time. </sentence><sentence id="175">And uh...some reason, I think people really didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was like a fear, or they didn't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I had no idea what was going on, and just accepted as it was. </sentence><sentence id="178">And then, they announced that our turn was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my father, being in the military, was given the choice. </sentence><sentence id="180">He could either stay in the army and save himself, or come <span class="building">home</span> and be deported with us. </sentence><sentence id="181">So he chose to come <span class="building">home</span> with us. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="183">How old were you at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Twelve years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you were 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="189">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="190">So your father came <span class="building">home</span> then, and uh he decided he was going to go with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="195">I don't think he had any idea where we're being taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, to...for him to work as a tailor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="199">And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well, the first inkling of what happened is, I recall it was in a Passover in "44. </sentence><sentence id="203">And it was a Pesach night; and we ...all of a sudden, we heard the knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">And we were all frightened who it is, because we had the shutters down. </sentence><sentence id="205">And here was somebody talking with a German accent. </sentence><sentence id="206">And it was the German soldiers knocking on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">They were not the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="208">They were the German soldiers retreating. </sentence><sentence id="209">And the strange thing was...about the whole thing is, that they come in... They were very polite in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="210">They asked if they could stay, because our <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> was vacant since the Czech officer had left. </sentence><sentence id="211">And  they even offered to pay. </sentence><sentence id="212">And they put on a picture that "Hey, we're not as bad." </sentence><sentence id="213">And now I see why. </sentence><sentence id="214">They wanted to have confidence. </sentence><sentence id="215">They even put on some acrobatic things for the people, to show that they have come within...for good will. </sentence><sentence id="216">But once they got the confidence of the people, then they showed their true color. </sentence><sentence id="217">They came with guns afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="235">David, was this in "43 or "44? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: This was in "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: "44. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then, we...we were notified that we were going to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="244">And there was uh...Just been accepting for us; because we were very Orthodox, and this was the will of God. </sentence><sentence id="245">And uh...(Excuse me) God will protect us and God will shield us from them, and just put our faith in him. </sentence><sentence id="246">And uh...when it came to our turn, we were only allowed to carry in our possession with us what we could carry. </sentence><sentence id="247">And we got a...like a flat <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> that we put our belongings, only what we could carry. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I can still remember that sight. </sentence><sentence id="249">This is in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="250">And after we loaded everything up and I looked at the <span class="building">house</span>... And here, what the Hungarian Nazi's did, had the chutzpah to do on top of it--what they...what you call "insult to injury"--is that they gave my a father a signed document, right in front of him. </sentence><sentence id="251">They even put a seal on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">Stating that when we come back the <span class="building">house</span> will belong to us, that nobody else will take it over. </sentence><sentence id="253">And yet, when I look back, within me I had the feeling that it's never going to be the same again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: So you loaded your...your... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Personal belongings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: ...personal belongings on a <span class="spatial object">cart</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: <span class="spatial object">Cart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">Yah, a <span class="spatial object">wooden cart</span> with a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">It had a couple of wheels. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="280">And then what happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: After that, they uh marched us to a <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">And the <span class="building">synagogue</span> was like an assembly point, where what they would do is they would bring enough people until there was enough for a <span class="spatial object">train</span> load. </sentence><sentence id="285">And, for us, this was like electric shock. </sentence><sentence id="286">Whenever we heard a <span class="spatial object">train</span> before, in...in 1942 and 1943, when they began... Uh, because we knew that the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> are coming to pick up more people, take them away. </sentence><sentence id="287">So we already knew that going to the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">We didn't know what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="289">But soon as we got into the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and we were there, it is  like being thrown into a <span class="spatial object">cage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">All of a sudden, they show their viciousness. </sentence><sentence id="291">Saw a couple of people passed out, and they beat them up; and we tried to help, and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help. </sentence><sentence id="292">So we already sensed that something bad is going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="304">So you were in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="305">What happened after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Well, after that we stayed there a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="310">Then the <span class="spatial object">train</span> arrived; and then we were put onto a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">It was still a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>, instead of a <span class="spatial object">cattle train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">And uh...from there, I found they took us to a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span> called <span class="populated place">Mateszalka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313"><span class="populated place">Mateszalka</span> was sort of a central point where they brought all the victims from all of the <span class="populated place">shtetlach</span> around in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">And it's...,just like they brought us to the <span class="building">train station</span> from one <span class="populated place">shtetlach</span>, that <span class="populated place">camp</span> was sort of a <span class="building">shul</span> for all of the surrounding <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">So when they had enough people in there for a large...or whenever a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was available, then that's where uh was the assembling point. </sentence><sentence id="316">And that was...uh we lived in <span class="building">tents</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="317">And uh we...uh we didn't know what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="318">Nobody said anything to anybody: where we're going, what's going to happen, where are we heading. </sentence><sentence id="319">We knew we're waiting for something. </sentence><sentence id="320">For a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to take us someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="321">It was not the place where we knew that we were going to stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="336">So then the <span class="spatial object">train</span> finally arrived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: The <span class="spatial object">train</span> arrived. </sentence><sentence id="340">It was several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="341">Four, five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="342">I can't recall the exact. </sentence><sentence id="343">And then, we still believed that we were being taken to a <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">And this time, instead of a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>, there was a <span class="spatial object">cattle train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">And they put us in, packed us very tight. </sentence><sentence id="346">And there was hardly <span class="interior space">room</span> to move. </sentence><sentence id="347">And the whole family there--my grandparents--they were still together. </sentence><sentence id="348">And when they locked the <span class="dlf">door</span>, the click, and put the key on, I knew within me--I wouldn't share it--I knew we were in for something. </sentence><sentence id="349">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="350">And when we got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, we could hear the Hungarian guards talking. </sentence><sentence id="351">Even though it was totally locked, we could hear them talking. </sentence><sentence id="352">So we knew we were guarded on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">And then the <span class="spatial object">train</span> kept travelling. </sentence><sentence id="354">It was maybe a couple of days or so. </sentence><sentence id="355">And then it came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="356">And we didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="357">Then we heard talking. </sentence><sentence id="358">All of a sudden we heard Hungarian, we heard German talking. </sentence><sentence id="359">And then the Hungarian voices disappeared; and then German guards had taken over. </sentence><sentence id="360">So that put fear in us, knowing that we're not going to <span class="country">Hungary</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="361">That this was... And from there on in, it was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="362">I'd say the beginning of the end, for a lot of people. ( </sentence><sentence id="363">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: Now once the Germans took over, what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Then, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> continued. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I think we traveled for another two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'm not sure the exact amount of time. </sentence><sentence id="394">And I still remember, I could look through the <span class="dlf">cracks</span> in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I didn't know where was heading...we're heading, or where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I saw  people working on damaged <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="397">Uh, there were <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">And later on, I found out that that's... <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was part of where they repaired--<span class="spatial object">planes</span> that were damaged during the war were stripped, used for spare parts. </sentence><sentence id="399">And also I remember seeing these uh...they're sort of <span class="spatial object">balloons</span>, so that <span class="spatial object">planes</span> cannot fly too low. </sentence><sentence id="400">And I had no idea what purpose they were; but there're to prevent <span class="spatial object">planes</span> from flying very far. </sentence><sentence id="401">And later... And I saw that sight. </sentence><sentence id="402">And...and when we arrived, it was like in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="403">It was a nice day. </sentence><sentence id="404">And we were all with anticipation. </sentence><sentence id="405">Where...where are we heading? </sentence><sentence id="406">And then the <span class="spatial object">train</span> kind of kept slowing down; and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> whistle blowing, slowing down. </sentence><sentence id="407">And then we see <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> compound there, and we see these things. </sentence><sentence id="408">And within me, wondering what is this. </sentence><sentence id="409">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="410">I never was in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then, all of a sudden, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="412">And they opened the <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">And that was... That's was when I saw <span class="region">Hell</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="414">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: That was the first real <span class="region">Hell</span> you saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: That was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: What happened there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Well, we were forced to get out. </sentence><sentence id="446">And all of a sudden, I...1 saw Nazis beating people. </sentence><sentence id="447">I've never seen in my life like that, actually. </sentence><sentence id="448">Physically beating, dragging children away from their parents. </sentence><sentence id="449">Because in...

"14?" </sentence><sentence id="486">And in a split second said, "Okay, you can go with the work group." </sentence><sentence id="487">If I...

And when we worked together, we talked about things: life, and uh he was telling me why he was...what crime he committed. </sentence><sentence id="627">And next day, to flaunt [it] in my face, he waves goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="628">Because he was released, free to go. </sentence><sentence id="629">And here I thought, "I did not any crime or anything. </sentence><sentence id="630">And mine, there's no time limit for me. </sentence><sentence id="631">Only death would be the limit." </sentence><sentence id="632">It was uh very, very sad to see that-- knowing that here he could go free, and here I didn't do anything that I was virtually sentenced for life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: Well, in uh <span class="populated place">Plaszow</span>, I was there about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="676">All of a sudden, without any warning, they yanked me out from the work group. </sentence><sentence id="677">Nobody...there's no such thing as sitting down like you would say, "Well, tomorrow you're going to go someplace else, or do that." </sentence><sentence id="678">Just, "Come!" </sentence><sentence id="679">And they yanked me and said, "Tonight, uh you're going to a different <span class="populated place">camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="680">And fortunately, I looked all around and I was able to find my father. </sentence><sentence id="681">And we said goodbye  through the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">And it was a very, very sad moment, too; knowing that I would never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="683">It...it just you had that feeling. </sentence><sentence id="684">I didn't give up hope, but it was very strange feeling. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then they put me on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and uh was like an overnight travel. </sentence><sentence id="686">And I found out after we arrived that it was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687"><span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span> was...I found out was a combination. </sentence><sentence id="688">An <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span>, and <span class="populated place">processing camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="689">So that when (excuse me) when the Russians were getting closer in <span class="populated place">Plaszew</span>, they didn't want us to be free...they took us to <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="690">And in <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>, they uh...we were waiting there and in process of being sent to another <span class="populated place">work camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="691">But before...uh we...they determined if we're going to be sent to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> or where, we were forced to strip naked in front of a...a doctor or somebody. </sentence><sentence id="692">And he looked us over like cattle. </sentence><sentence id="693">And he determined whether you were physically fit to do heavy physical work. </sentence><sentence id="694">Or if not, then there was..they had the <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span> right there. </sentence><sentence id="695">And I...they did not tell you where you're going to be sent or what. </sentence><sentence id="696">And after about 6 weeks--it seems like an average cycle (laughing)--6 weeks, they put me in a <span class="spatial object">train</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="697">I'd become a professional (laughing) traveller at that time. </sentence><sentence id="698">And then I found out...at this time I was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">Actually, the first <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> itself. </sentence><sentence id="700">And the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, meaning that in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> it was primarily for work. </sentence><sentence id="701">And when they wanted to exterminate somebody or end his life, they took him to places like <span class="populated place">GroB Rosen</span> or <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="702">They had their methods to their madness. </sentence><sentence id="703">So again, in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span>," the same thing. " </sentence><sentence id="704">We need bricklayers." </sentence><sentence id="705">Now, since I was a professional bricklayer (laughing), I right away raised my hand. </sentence><sentence id="706">And I was put into a work group. </sentence><sentence id="707">And it was very, very, very difficult work. </sentence><sentence id="708">We had to march several miles to work. </sentence><sentence id="709">And I was already half dead when I already got to work. </sentence><sentence id="710">And then to work yet, uh it took all the strength just to make it through the marching. </sentence><sentence id="711">And then, when we marched back, if a person was not physically able to complete the march, they just shot him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="712">There was no...there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="713">So uh...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: Well, we lived in the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="760">It was like this for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="761">Ice cold; no heating at all. </sentence><sentence id="762">In the morning, we had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and take an ice cold <span class="interior space">shower</span> in an ice cold <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="763">After we took the <span class="interior space">shower</span>, we had to go and stand outside in the bitter cold for roll call. </sentence><sentence id="764">And finally, after that, they would give us some coffee and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="765">That was our ration. </sentence><sentence id="766">And then...uh we would then be on standby for which work group we're going to go. </sentence><sentence id="767">Because every day they need work in different <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="768">So then they would select us to go to a certain...oftentimes, work in the <span class="building">city building</span> <span class="building">air raid shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">And when there would be a raid, we had to stay in the open. </sentence><sentence id="770">And they watched us from a distance. [ </sentence><sentence id="771">If] we  0 ran, we would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="772">So we were not afraid; because when we saw the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, we knew when we heard the bombing that they're coming to liberate us. </sentence><sentence id="773">A uh very unique incident happened in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span> that kind of stands out a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="774">Is when I was standing for roll call there; and as I'm standing, all of a sudden I hear a noise in the <span class="env feature">sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">And during roll call, it was a rule you were not supposed to make any movement. </sentence><sentence id="776">Not anything. </sentence><sentence id="777">And I was very curious. </sentence><sentence id="778">I looked up to see where that noise was coming from; and I saw it was <span class="spatial object">American bombers</span> flying over there on a mission to destroy <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">And as I looked up with envy, wishing that I was one of those <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, thinking [of] being free, all of a sudden I hear a shrill right in front of me that could be heard in front of the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="780">There was a Nazi Commandant saw me looking up. </sentence><sentence id="781">And: "Du! </sentence><sentence id="782">Schweinhund!" </sentence><sentence id="783">Why did I disobey his order? </sentence><sentence id="784">And he had a big stick in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="785">And his habit was, if somebody disobeyed one of his orders, he would ask him first, "Why did you do that," or "Why did you disobey?" </sentence><sentence id="786">And soon as the person answered, wham! </sentence><sentence id="787">He let him have it. </sentence><sentence id="788">And oftentimes that person would be beaten so badly that he could not go back to work, or [it] put him to death. </sentence><sentence id="789">Now here was my turn. " </sentence><sentence id="790">Why did you disobey?" </sentence><sentence id="791">And the little voice inside that told me in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> not to say anything, to keep quiet, was there the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="792">Saying, "Don't answer! </sentence><sentence id="793">Don't say anything!" </sentence><sentence id="794">And I was just looking straight in his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="795">And he was waiting for me to reply, and he was getting very impatient. </sentence><sentence id="796">In front of the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> there, here's a little Jew standing up there (laughing) that won't do what he says. </sentence><sentence id="797">And that little voice inside saying, "Don't answer. </sentence><sentence id="798">Don't say anything." </sentence><sentence id="799">He's getting...he says, "I know why you looked up." </sentence><sentence id="800">He says, "You wish you were on one of those <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, don't you? </sentence><sentence id="801">You wish you were free!," </sentence><sentence id="802">he says. </sentence><sentence id="803">And I just keep looking straight in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="804">He says, "Well, I got news for you!" </sentence><sentence id="805">He says, "You'll never be free again. </sentence><sentence id="806">You'll never make it out alive from here!" </sentence><sentence id="807">And I just looked him straight in the eye; and I said, "Someday..."

( </sentence><sentence id="817">Laughing) Phew. </sentence><sentence id="818">And here it was, another day of survival. </sentence><sentence id="819">Now the interesting ending of this story is that during the Korean uh Conflict, I was drafted in the [<span class="country">US</span>] military service. </sentence><sentence id="820">And afterwards I was sent overseas on a mission to keep the peace in Europe; and as I was flying over Europe and over <span class="country">Germany</span>, I looked at the <span class="env feature">ground</span> below. </sentence><sentence id="821">And I wondered if that Nazi Commandant was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="822">And if he was still alive, what would he have said if he knew that I was not only free, but also in one of those <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">For me, it was a moment to remember, that when...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: In this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="898">You stood for roll call, and then you went to work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="901">A: Well, afterwards they uh...the Nazi Commandant sensed that there is still some youth left under 16 in the...in the work groups. </sentence><sentence id="902">And he didn't know how to... guess you use the words "flush them out." </sentence><sentence id="903">Because we all said we were older, and we were able to do the work. </sentence><sentence id="904">So then they couldn't say that we couldn't do the work; because if we couldn't have done the work, they wouldn't have kept us there in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="905">But he was very determined that he was not going to let any youth. </sentence><sentence id="906">And then he decided he's going to play one of his games different; that he is going to offer extra rations to anybody that can turn in a youth under 16.It's amazing what happens. </sentence><sentence id="907">There's only a few that knew about my age. </sentence><sentence id="908">Adults there. </sentence><sentence id="909">And before I knew it, all of a sudden I was yanked out from the work group and put with... We were about 13 in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> who were still...uh managed to hide until now. </sentence><sentence id="910">And this time, they told us that we're being sent to an <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span> because of...of our age. </sentence><sentence id="911">And I remember standing there with a group of others; and my thoughts were going through that this is the last day of life and that tomorrow will be end, and that I'll never return <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="912">And all of a sudden, I started concentrating mentally: that I want to return <span class="building">home</span>, I want to be with my family, I want to be free again. </sentence><sentence id="913">And I started--without me even being aware of this coming--it's like the mind almost like going out of control, the concentration. </sentence><sentence id="914">All of a sudden, as I'm doing that, here's the Nazi Commandant front of me, standing there. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I thought... "Raus!," </sentence><sentence id="916">he says. </sentence><sentence id="917">And I thought I'm the first one that going to be shot or something. </sentence><sentence id="918">And all of a sudden, what happened that moment was that a group that was going out, a person had just passed out. </sentence><sentence id="919">And he [NB: the Commandant] went...passed through over a hundred people who were on standby--adults--and didn't ask them. </sentence><sentence id="920">And came to my group, and ordered me to go back into the work group. </sentence><sentence id="921">All the others were taken to extermination. </sentence><sentence id="922">And for me, it was like a rekindling. </sentence><sentence id="923">Here I was. </sentence><sentence id="924">As long as you were in a work group, there was still hope for survival. </sentence><sentence id="925">The interesting thing was...is that while I had hopes for survival being in the work group, I knew that now the Nazi Commandant knew about my age. </sentence><sentence id="926">He knew about me. </sentence><sentence id="927">And every day, I wondered, "How long am I going to remain in the work group?" </sentence><sentence id="928">I knew that he was very obsessed. </sentence><sentence id="929">Sure enough, after 6 weeks, I was yanked out of the work group and was taken into another <span class="building">compound</span>. </sentence><sentence id="930">What they did is that they had a separate compound for those who are no longer considered physically fit to work. </sentence><sentence id="931">And they would take them over to the <span class="building">compound</span>, and then a <span class="spatial object">train</span> would take them to a <span class="populated place">extermination camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">So this time, I pretty much resigned myself that no...no more concentration of being surviving, being able to make it; that this time I'm not going to make it, even though the will  2 and desire was still there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Well, the journey...my thirst. </sentence><sentence id="1111">They didn't...they just gave us a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1112">We couldn't even eat, because we were very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And the thirst pains were so bad that I even tried to use the urine from my body, just to wet my lips. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And I pretty much, as it went down uh...When we arrive, this was, I found out later, in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And when we arrived, I had already passed out, virtually. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Three out of 150 there survived. </sentence><sentence id="1117">They all...the rest of them just lay dead. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And what they did is, they pick me up from the...with the hands and somebody else with the legs. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And then they threw me in a <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span>...and they're getting ready to take me to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1120">That's where they took...that's where their objective was. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And somehow, they...somebody who was carrying me noticed a hand moving, that I was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1122">So at a tisk to his life, he took me into a <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">It was actually like a <span class="interior space">shower room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And I was dazed at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Virtually, I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I thought... And when I came to [in] the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> there, it was... I woke up, and I...I thought I was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I felt like I was in another world. </sentence><sentence id="1128">"What are these people doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1129">Where am I?" </sentence><sentence id="1130">And I thought, I...L..I was totally dazed. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I couldn't figure out even where I am. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And then somebody came over and told me what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Explained to me that "You were just a few seconds away from being thrust into the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, and they saw that you were still alive." </sentence><sentence id="1134">And they said, "You're the first youth that age who actually made it alive." </sentence><sentence id="1135">And then they took me and they hid me, you know, secretly in their <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So I was not even supposed to have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And I became like, to them, like a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1138">That here are these fathers who said, well, if I made it then maybe their children would have made it through. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And they...since I didn't get any rations, because I was... The ration was there like a piece of bread--enough to keep them alive until they were actually being...were going to be taken to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And each one would take a piece of bread; and they would break off a piece and make up a slice for me, so that I could survive. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And they said, "David, you must survive and let the world know what  4 happened." </sentence><sentence id="1142">I had no idea what they meant, or what they said. </sentence><sentence id="1143">That basically was what had driven me to tell this story--not to make sure that it is not...make sure that it is not forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And so over there, after... In <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, I..uh started getting on my feet again; and found out I was in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And uh... Every night I heard the <span class="env feature">earth</span> shaking from the bombardments. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And here, in my mind I was thinking, "It is now really a race against time." </sentence><sentence id="1147">We knew any day that this is going to end. </sentence><sentence id="1148">The question was if we're going to make it out alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1191">A: Hope. </sentence><sentence id="1192">To be able to go on, to...to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1193">What kept me is the belief that maybe my family is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And it was... in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, it was uh really uh very traumatic experiences that you would talk to one person one night, and the next morning he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And then he would be taken like a piece of garbage and thrown on the <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1196">You don't think...you're not a human being anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1197">You don't even know what you're thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1198">You're just a person dazed, traumatized. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And don't even know by what I'm hanging in. </sentence><sentence id="1200">But the will to live there was still strong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: What happened next after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1213">A: Well, I was there about 6 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And all of a sudden, again, I was yanked out (laughing) without any warning and put on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Now this time I could consider myself really a professional! </sentence><sentence id="1216">It was a really a strange experience. </sentence><sentence id="1217">I actually walked out of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> on my own two feet--which a Nazi said...Commandant in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span> said I would never do. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They took the few of us that could still walk, and they marched us out. </sentence><sentence id="1219">And we had no idea why they were marching us out. </sentence><sentence id="1220">This was about three days before the Americans came. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And they put us in a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And I learned, years later, what actually their main purpose was. </sentence><sentence id="1223">But at that time, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And we travelled for about a couple of hours or so; and then they told us to get off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And I found out that I was...it was a little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Austria</span> called <span class="populated place">Innsbruck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And as we were walk...marching off from...getting off from the <span class="building">train station</span>, I remember that I saw...I looked...a couple of women in a group there, looking...were staring at us. </sentence><sentence id="1227">That they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And within me, I sensed that something is going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And after we marched out of the <span class="building">station</span> into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, they started shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="1230">They massacred many of them. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And we got to a <span class="dlf">street</span>, uh...and it was, this was...this was in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>...in the <span class="region">Tyrolian Mountains</span> of <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And all of a sudden, they started...the <span class="spatial object">machine guns</span> started firing at us. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And many just panicked, run in every direction. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Something...I had something inside told me, "Look where that fire is coming from." </sentence><sentence id="1235">And as I saw it, and I dived into a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and it just missed me. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And uh this was still in April of "45, now. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And I slept all night in that <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1238">When I woke up in the morning, snow was all over me and I was virtually frozen. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I couldn't get up. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And I had to walk bent over. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I had no idea where I was, what in the Hell I'm doing here. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And <span class="building">I  5</span> started...I just started trying to straighten out a little bit; and then I started marching. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And all of a sudden, the Germans came and rounded us up again--those who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And then... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1283">Q: Because they're going to have to change and put in a new tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1285">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Good. </sentence><sentence id="1288"> 6 TAPE #2 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1289"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1290">A: Well, after they rounded us up again...uh it was a strange phenomena that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1291">All of a sudden, there were soldiers, civilians, hunters with their rifles got together with us. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And no one talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="1293">No one said a word to us, or what's going, or where we're heading. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And just told [us] to march. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And...(excuse me)...and we had no idea where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="1296">All I knew is that I was marching towards the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And I saw the German soldiers retreating, going the other way. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And we kept going "til nightfall. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And all of a sudden, when we got through...nightfall came, they told us to march forward. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And then they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Everyone! </sentence><sentence id="1302">The hunters, the civilians, the soldiers... No one tells you, and you don't question. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And then, as a protection, a few of us, we went and started climbing the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We figured we would be safer. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We didn't...the guards disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We were left on our own. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So then I marched to the highest <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, with the strength that I had left; and I slept in a <span class="building">barn</span> there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="1308">We found a <span class="building">barn</span> on top of the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And when morning came, there were about 10 of us assembled there. </sentence><sentence id="1310">We could look from the top of the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, there were <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> going there. </sentence><sentence id="1311">But we couldn't tell whether they were <span class="spatial object">German vehicles</span> or whether they were American. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And so somebody said... You know, I didn't have any food. </sentence><sentence id="1313">I was very starved. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And somebody had [food] there. </sentence><sentence id="1315">They said, "We'll give you some food if you'll go down and take a look." ( </sentence><sentence id="1316">Laughing) Well, I figured like this: "If they're Americans, I would be free. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And if...if not, either way, I'd end up being starved to death or be back in captivity." </sentence><sentence id="1318">So I said, "I'll go." </sentence><sentence id="1319">That was the most suspenseful walk down the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1320">I am walking slowly, slowly, slowly, to go down and see who are they. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Well, I could not tell what <span class="spatial object">American vehicles</span> look like; but I knew they were not German. </sentence><sentence id="1322">So I assumed it must be (laughing) the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And as I walked down and I saw that they were not German, I motioned for the others also to come down. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I never did get the food, (laughing) because I never went back up again for it. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And I saw <span class="spatial object">military vehicles</span> going by. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And for me, that was one of the most moving experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Because I actually saw the mighty German Army surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1328">American soldiers holding guns behind. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And here are these same soldiers [who] were holding guns on my back, and now somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1330">This is...it's so difficult to explain...to...how life can be. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Here, one day here's a group of people that wanted to destroy you; and here's another group of people that want to save you. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And as I got down the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, I waved a <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span> to flag him down. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So [he] pulled over. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And it was one of those small <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> where soldiers were sitting in the back. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And I waved at him; and I couldn't speak a word of English. </sentence><sentence id="1336">So, the only thing [NB: way] I would tell him that I'm hungry, I just pointed my finger (laughing) at my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1337">So they  7 gave me some crackers, and they just went on. </sentence><sentence id="1338">And I just started walking. </sentence><sentence id="1339">I don't know where I was walking. ( </sentence><sentence id="1340">Laughing) There wasn't anybody there uh picking me up, or asking. </sentence><sentence id="1341">They were just busy, the soldiers, going up to finishing up the final remnants of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1342">Um, I wanted to share something, to back track a little bit, on... When the Germans had retreated and the...we were walking towards the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, we were actually walking into a <span class="dlf">line</span> of fire. </sentence><sentence id="1343">Because the American soldiers... That's what actually the Germans wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1344">They wanted us...hoping we would get killed by American firepower. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And we received a terrific pounding. </sentence><sentence id="1346">The <span class="env feature">earth</span> was shaking and trembling from <span class="spatial object">American guns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Because they...we were right in no <span class="region">man's land</span>, there in between. </sentence><sentence id="1348">So after having gone through that <span class="region">Hell</span>--and I remember that night, saying, "If I'd only make it through that night," I said, "I would be free." </sentence><sentence id="1349">And I wrote... Later on, I wrote a poem about that...I'm not afraid... Entitled, "I'm not Afraid to March Forward, Because that's the <span class="dlf">Road to Freedom</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1350">And that poem won a golden award for that. </sentence><sentence id="1351">So it made me feel pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="1352">It describes my feelings as I am marching toward the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>--the thoughts, and the feeling that tomorrow I'll be free again. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And then I...[ have some music with it; and I used it as a teaching [tool]. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And when I speak to students, we sing it together. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And...and it's very inspirational for them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">And as I started going back, I started walking, a <span class="spatial object">military vehicle</span> stopped and picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And what they were doing, they were picking up survivors like me, stragglers who were lost. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And they carried me through...first to a <span class="populated place">German town</span>, and uh...<span class="populated place">Gar</span>...<span class="populated place">Garmisch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Yah, <span class="populated place">Garmisch</span> is there. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And we...it was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I saw most of the women were wearing white nurses" cap. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So I asked, "What is a white nursing... Why is everybody all of sudden a nurse?" </sentence><sentence id="1363">Well, what I was explained is that the Russians, when they invaded, they used to rape women. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And this way, they thought the Americans would do the same things. </sentence><sentence id="1365">So by being a nurse, they were hoping they wouldn't be. ( </sentence><sentence id="1366">Laughing) So they then took me to a <span class="building">sanatorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Not at first. </sentence><sentence id="1369">First they took me into a <span class="building">German home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And they were giving everybody the C-ration food now. </sentence><sentence id="1371">And everybody was grabbing it, and taking... We were in that <span class="building">home</span>... think we were about 10 or 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And I was the only one that turned them down, American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And they said, "Look here, everybody's eating the food. </sentence><sentence id="1374">How come you're not eating it?" </sentence><sentence id="1375">I said, "That food is going to make me sick." </sentence><sentence id="1376">I said, "I am not used to eating that good kind of food." </sentence><sentence id="1377">They said, "Well, what do you want?" </sentence><sentence id="1378">I said, "I'd like to have some fresh vegetables." " </sentence><sentence id="1379">Where are we going to get fresh vegetables? </sentence><sentence id="1380">There's a war going on!

I don't know what I was...whether it was really me saying; but I just said, "I'll make it." </sentence><sentence id="1963">And I went back in training again; and I asked them only one thing, before I went back, is to waive the requirement of having to go through that <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span> exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And they said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1965">And I went back training again. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And it was just like in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Up in the 4:00 morning, standing roll call again.(Laughing) "You're the lowest scum on earth!" </sentence><sentence id="1968">Again, too. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Here we go again. </sentence><sentence id="1971">How much more can a person take something like that? </sentence><sentence id="1972">But you become numb, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1973">You...you're not really sensitive to feelings any more. </sentence><sentence id="1974">You just...you know that you have to do that to get over to get to the next step. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And I knew, just like in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, that they are rewards for hard work in there. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And I went and I really worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="1977">Not only in physical training in the military, but we had to do a lot of training we had to learn from books--tactics, manuevers. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And I made up my mind that I wanted to be on top. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And we finished...we were like a hundred and fifty of us; and I finished in the top three on the 150. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And then, because of that, they sent me for special <span class="building">military intelligence training school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: What happened with the <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2036">A: Well, uh...when--ironic--when I finished and they sent me out to the <span class="building">school</span>, they...uh they made me in charge of the group of the... They gave me in charge of the record. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And I had no idea why, really, I had all those problems from the...from what caused the paralysis. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And since I was in charge of the records, I looked up...I was able to look and see. </sentence><sentence id="2039">They wouldn't tell me why it was. </sentence><sentence id="2040">They just said... And then I learned that it was because of that. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Because I didn't understand yet all this what's going on inside the mind. </sentence><sentence id="2042">I knew it was from that, but I really did not know the details of it. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So this kind of helped me uh understand myself a little better. </sentence><sentence id="2044">So then, when we got into training and I finished, I was almost a year in communications intelligence; because what they trained us for is to be <span class="dlf">front line</span> person for the war, to report what's going on for the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2045">It was in the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And then after I finished training and they sent me to the <span class="region">South</span> for more advanced training; and then they sort of divided up. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Half of us went to Europe, and the other half went to <span class="country">Korea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2048">Fortunately, my name--because it was alphabetical--they took the first half of the alphabet list, they sent to <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2049">So it was a little bit of luck there, because if I had gotten into <span class="country">Korea</span> I would have been sent... My function was the training to be a <span class="dlf">front line</span> observer like. </sentence><sentence id="2050">So when they sent me to Europe--they didn't say where--when I got to Europe, they said I'm going to be sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="2051">Laughing) And ironically, when there I was...I was numbed again. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I said, "There is one thing that I'm gonna do...want to do. </sentence><sentence id="2053">Is I want to finish my military obligation, and I want to visit <span class="country">Palestine</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2054">Because when I left that group in <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1946, I made a commitment that someday I'll look them up. </sentence><sentence id="2055">And so I saved up all my military leave time, and uh used it up to go to Europe [NB: <span class="country">Israel</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="2056">It was a...as I'm talking, there was a little incident that is ...happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> that I thought it would be worthwhile sharing with you. </sentence><sentence id="2057">Is...uh part of my job was also delivering supplies to the <span class="region">area</span> where we were  4 stand...where we stayed, in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2058">And once when I was driving--this was a real <span class="spatial object">big-semi truck</span> that I was driving--and it was really rainy, very slippery. </sentence><sentence id="2059">As I was going up the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, I was going...and all of a sudden, as I was going downwards, I see a group of civilians right in the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2060">I didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2061">I slam on the brakes and my whole <span class="spatial object">truck</span> went out of control. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And the civilians scattering all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2063">And here I am fighting to bring the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> under control. </sentence><sentence id="2064">And all of a sudden, finally, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2065">The <span class="spatial object">truck</span> went a little uphill climb, and it came to a stop. </sentence><sentence id="2066">And all of a sudden, the German civilians were came and all around the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2067">So since I could speak German, I asked if I did any harm or any damage when this... Because I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2068">They said no. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Uh, then I said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2070">Why don't you just move out, and I want to keep going." " </sentence><sentence id="2071">No." </sentence><sentence id="2072">They took ... And they had a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, a small <span class="spatial object">truck</span>; and they parked it right in front of mine. </sentence><sentence id="2073">They weren't going to let me go, and they wouldn't tell me what uh it's all about. </sentence><sentence id="2074">And I figured ... Well, I took the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> in gear and started pushing that other <span class="spatial object">truck</span> off the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And they were trying to prevent me from doing... And all of a sudden, I see a German comes up and with a gun. </sentence><sentence id="2076">Yells, "Halt!" </sentence><sentence id="2077">And that was... I had a gun, too. </sentence><sentence id="2078">We were given it to protect ourself. </sentence><sentence id="2079">All the fury that ever came out... Because I didn't want to, before, intermingle with anything; because I knew I'm there to do my job. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I yelled out...back at him, that he was so shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2081">Here a American soldier is yelling at him in German. </sentence><sentence id="2082">He didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="2083">He said, "Raus!" </sentence><sentence id="2084">And I said, "I didn't do any harm. </sentence><sentence id="2085">I didn't do any damage to anything, and I'm not going to get out." </sentence><sentence id="2086">And he saw the seriousness on my face, and he saw... And he reminded me of that Nazi Commandant, and...that in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2087">I mean, here...in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span>, being if it was like that, I wouldn't have said one word. </sentence><sentence id="2088">And here, there were all kinds of witnesses around. </sentence><sentence id="2089">There were two in the front. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And he saw that it was a good chance that he could have died, too, if he did something. </sentence><sentence id="2091">And I that felt...I said, "I'm not going to let go." </sentence><sentence id="2092">I felt, and a thought came to me, "Here I came as a...to keep the peace, and I could end up dying." </sentence><sentence id="2093">And he saw the seriousness there was. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And he was looking around and he was thinking (laughing) that maybe (laughing) it could happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And he put the gun back in his <span class="spatial object">holster</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2096">And I asked him, "What happened? </sentence><sentence id="2097">Why...why all this happened? </sentence><sentence id="2098">What's going on." </sentence><sentence id="2099">He said [that] ahead of me, there happened to be an American soldier was driving [who] inadvertently killed a German civilian. </sentence><sentence id="2100">So the civilians were harassing the American troops. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Or anybody that come down. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And be like in the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and the person go out of control. </sentence><sentence id="2103">And then they'd run away. </sentence><sentence id="2104">And I just happen to be in the <span class="dlf">road</span> again. ( </sentence><sentence id="2105">Laughing) And what did he do? </sentence><sentence id="2106">Three weeks later, I get called in by the commander from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2107">He says, "Dave, I just got a report that you killed a German civilian." </sentence><sentence id="2108">Of course, I had the witness and told the story. </sentence><sentence id="2109">He was so angry of what that German policeman did, trying... because of what I did [that] he wrote to the mayor of that <span class="populated place">town</span>, telling that this is not <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And so that's when that ended. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2186">Q: Okay, then, right after... Then, after you completed your service in <span class="country">Germany</span>, you came back to the <span class="country">United States</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2187"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2190">A: I went for that... I told you about that visit to <span class="country">Palestine</span>--it was <span class="country">Israel</span>, in 1956. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And after I got back, I went back to civilian life, and tried one more time. ( </sentence><sentence id="2192">Laughing) So then I went to <span class="building">school of engineering</span>, since I was in communications engineering. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And I went and also got a job, working in the day and going to <span class="building">school</span> at night. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2206">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2207">Thanks very much. </sentence><sentence id="2208">I think we went through the whole thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2212">A: Yah, it's... I think that uh we can all learn from what has happened, that... The things that I try to emphasize, as I teach it in the <span class="building">schools</span>, is to...for the...those who are involved in teaching education to teach the youth that this is not a one-time happening. </sentence><sentence id="2213">That we must understand ourselves first. </sentence><sentence id="2214">That we have to understand that--and this is difficult to communicate--that every human being is capable of carrying out horrors and atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="2215">Because there were some uh victims in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, who became Kapos, that were more brutal than the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="2216">Because they wanted to have favors. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And then there were some guards, who did...all they did is guard. </sentence><sentence id="2218">They did not uh actually uh abuse people. </sentence><sentence id="2219">In fact, as I look back, there was one incident in <span class="populated place">Reichenbach</span> that happened that I was working in a <span class="building">woman's compound</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And there were uh newly arrived women in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, who saw me uh working there. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And was...must have been a mother. </sentence><sentence id="2222">And she says, "<span class="building">Kinderle</span>."

" </sentence><sentence id="2224">You! </sentence><sentence id="2225">I got some food for you." </sentence><sentence id="2226">I said... She says, "Come on! </sentence><sentence id="2227">Come on! </sentence><sentence id="2228">The guard is not looking now." </sentence><sentence id="2229">So I ran to the <span class="dlf">fence</span> quickly, and she gave me some bread, and I ran back to the detail...work detail. </sentence><sentence id="2230">And there was a guard coming [who] saw me. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Once you did that, that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="2233">And he said...it was uh one thing...once you were caught, it was off to a <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2234">It was traditional they take you to a <span class="dlf">wall</span> with a stick; and you got the stick and picked it up and walking to the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2235">And I prepared myself. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And all of a sudden, just before we got there, he stopped and he asked me how old I was. </sentence><sentence id="2237">And here was a little voice that said... For the first time, I had to make a decision. </sentence><sentence id="2238">If I told him my real age, I knew I was gonna... If I told him the truth that was my age, then I knew that that was the end; because he would turn me in. </sentence><sentence id="2239">There was a voice saying, "This time, tell what your age is." </sentence><sentence id="2240">I told him that I am 13. </sentence><sentence id="2241">He looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="2242">He says, "Get back to work!" </sentence><sentence id="2243">And I was expecting, after that incident happened, that he would turn me in. </sentence><sentence id="2244">And he never turned me in. </sentence><sentence id="2245">Strange things happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I know if I had have said 16, that would be the end. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And I took a chance, [a] risk, saying that I was 13. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
