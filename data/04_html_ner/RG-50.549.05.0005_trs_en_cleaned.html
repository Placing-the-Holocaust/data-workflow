<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: See, I don't remember what I did. </sentence><sentence id="4">So, that's about really about my father. </sentence><sentence id="5">And then in one of the interviews, I did tell them that when the Germans came in, he was the head of that five member committee. </sentence><sentence id="6">So, I don't want to repeat myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: So, this is about all I can tell about my parents. </sentence><sentence id="14">And I might have talked about my brothers, but this is the answer that what my father did, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: I wondered if you knew about your grandparents and about your family's history in <span class="country">Hungary</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Ihave pictures of them, but very little. </sentence><sentence id="20">I really don't...I have a picture of my grandfather and grandmother on my father's side and no pictures on my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="21">I know absolutely nothing of the family history on my mother's side, except that she had two sisters and we were close to the sisters. </sentence><sentence id="22">But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died. </sentence><sentence id="23">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="24">My father's mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because, you know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black <span class="spatial object">casket</span>, and we were... but when my grandfather died, I do not remember that. </sentence><sentence id="25">I think he died, might have died before I ever was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: Do you know what brought your parents both to <span class="populated place">Eger</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: No, sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="38">Going on with the summary of your experiences. </sentence><sentence id="39">So, you did talk some about your brothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944, you were moved into a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="43">Lived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a <span class="building">brick factory</span>, called <span class="populated place">Kerecsend</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">And there for a few days, then from there, loaded onto <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> and taken to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, where you were separated from your parents. </sentence><sentence id="45">You worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Not right away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Not right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: First I was in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> for a month. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then from <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> in a <span class="spatial object">lager</span>, which was called A Lager. </sentence><sentence id="52">And two weeks after that I got in on the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> work. </sentence><sentence id="53">So that had to be, we were taken out in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: In January of 1945, you were forced to leave <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to go on a Death March towards <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of become close with, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="62"> 3 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="63">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="64"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, who I still keep contact with, who lives now in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">She was from <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, actually, from the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Isad</span> (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. </sentence><sentence id="67">And she's really the one, who I kept close. </sentence><sentence id="68">If you would ask me what were the other girls" names, I do not remember, and I do not know, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you know what became of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="76">I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I don't even believe we worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other. </sentence><sentence id="78">She was older than I am. </sentence><sentence id="79">She used to be a seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="80">And in my stories, I think it's mentioned that on some of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> rides, after we were already liberated, we were together. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I do know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="82">And she lives, she remarried. </sentence><sentence id="83">She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">And he died in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="85">I think he was an artist. </sentence><sentence id="86">And although I never thought I want to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in <span class="country">Germany</span>, which took us to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">That's the first time I have seen her after <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> times. </sentence><sentence id="90">And she still lives in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">She's much older than I am, so at times I've heard that she's kind of ill. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, I don't know what she's doing. </sentence><sentence id="93">I have a feeling her husband was originally from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their <span class="building">home</span> there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: <span class="populated place">Rosenfeld</span>, <span class="populated place">Bezsi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">Bezsi's like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name. </sentence><sentence id="117">That was actually her name from the first marriage. </sentence><sentence id="118">That's the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband's name was. </sentence><sentence id="119">So, we called her <span class="populated place">Rosenfeld</span>, <span class="building">B6zsi</span> and she was from <span class="populated place">Eger</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">So. </sentence><sentence id="121">And that's all. </sentence><sentence id="122">I never kept up with anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="123">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="124">But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. </sentence><sentence id="126">Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="127">So, I can't give you any names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: How did you become so close with <span class="building">Ilus</span>!? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and we met. </sentence><sentence id="144">And she's exactly my age and somehow we liked each other. </sentence><sentence id="145">And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were leaving, and my husband's two sisters were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but they were taken away to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in <span class="building">factories</span> or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="147">But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so- called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn't know exactly what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="148">We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we did become good friends to the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me. </sentence><sentence id="151">But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 5 therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March. </sentence><sentence id="152">She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and they were... ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume. </sentence><sentence id="166">But I do not recall it. </sentence><sentence id="167">Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don't even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. </sentence><sentence id="168">So, I cannot give you any information about that. </sentence><sentence id="169">Then later she got married and they moved to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we kept up. </sentence><sentence id="171">In fact, last year I was in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and she came to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and spent a week. </sentence><sentence id="172">So we saw each other then. </sentence><sentence id="173">And unfortunately now, she lives in <span class="populated place">Netanya</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">Have you ever been in <span class="country">Israel</span>, yourself? </sentence><sentence id="175">And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And she doesn't have any family anymore, because she never had any children. </sentence><sentence id="177">Her husband died years ago. </sentence><sentence id="178">She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And she was first in the <span class="building">hospital</span> for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="180">Then she was in some sort of a <span class="building">nursing home</span> situation, because | think she had a broken hip and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="181">And in that age, she's very little and fragile. </sentence><sentence id="182">And then she is now back in her <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">She doesn't like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. </sentence><sentence id="184">I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot... but she's somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="185">Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the place. </sentence><sentence id="186">And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have? </sentence><sentence id="187">And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn't looking forward to. </sentence><sentence id="188">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: You mentioned about that time that you were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, that you didn't fully believe what was happening there. </sentence><sentence id="214">And as far as... as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was she more informed than you were on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> work. </sentence><sentence id="218">Later, because I worked first in one part of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, then in another part. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I think we met a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="220">But I don't know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don't know whether I'm just so naive or I was so naive at the time. </sentence><sentence id="221">Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. </sentence><sentence id="222">Have you read that book? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: I actually have only read parts of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, it's a very easy. </sentence><sentence id="232">And I read that just in <span class="populated place">Nashville</span>, while, you know, I had a little time to read it. </sentence><sentence id="233">And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. </sentence><sentence id="234">Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it. </sentence><sentence id="235">Well, I am either very naive... I could never have believed anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="236">We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="237">They were from <span class="country">Poland</span> 5 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="238">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="239"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 6 or <span class="country">Russia</span> and they would tell us. </sentence><sentence id="240">But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war. </sentence><sentence id="241">See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="242">And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean. </sentence><sentence id="243">Because a lot of the kapos in the <span class="building">barracks</span> were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back. </sentence><sentence id="244">And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="245">So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn't believe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, [hope so. </sentence><sentence id="266">It could be. </sentence><sentence id="267">And we didn't read about this that much, you know like I listened or read different kind of stories about people. </sentence><sentence id="268">Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in <span class="country">Hungary</span> they did not know anything about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">We did not know anything about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And I don't think my parents did. </sentence><sentence id="271">At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. </sentence><sentence id="272">They were the type of people that they didn't want to scare you. </sentence><sentence id="273">Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that. </sentence><sentence id="274">And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what's going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="275">The <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> were not... we did not know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="276">Like when we're in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it's going to be <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, because I did not know anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I am talking only about myself. </sentence><sentence id="278">You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings. </sentence><sentence id="279">We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn't know where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> meant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really...? </sentence><sentence id="298">I can't remember when that came to our mind, you know. </sentence><sentence id="299">For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another <span class="populated place">camp</span> and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people. </sentence><sentence id="300">Well, I was the youngest, and I didn't have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister- in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. </sentence><sentence id="301">Well, they wouldn't have imagined that they were burned in the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">When did we came to the realization? </sentence><sentence id="304">Toward the very end. </sentence><sentence id="305">I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe. </sentence><sentence id="306">But it wasn't that it just happened one day. </sentence><sentence id="307">And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. </sentence><sentence id="308">It is just... everything was so gradual that I couldn't recall anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="309">And I wanted to get back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">By then, I kind of knew that I'm not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="311">Of course, I didn't find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. </sentence><sentence id="312">But when did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="313">I don't really know. ( </sentence><sentence id="314"><span class="spatial object">Doorbell</span> rings.) </sentence><sentence id="315">Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you cried for them? </sentence><sentence id="336">That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="339"> 6 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="340">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="341"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it is, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> and so many horrible things were going on, I don't remember really ever crying. </sentence><sentence id="343">You know? </sentence><sentence id="344">The shock was so great. </sentence><sentence id="345">And afterwards, see, when I got back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once. </sentence><sentence id="346">And so, I don't, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn't find my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="347">But it's funny, I wasn't... it's not funny at all, but I apparently didn't cry that easily. </sentence><sentence id="348">I mean I might have held it back more. </sentence><sentence id="349">And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn't... like that we go to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> when we are in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids. </sentence><sentence id="350">My family's names are on it. </sentence><sentence id="351">And it's just, you know, you're just under, it's a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? </sentence><sentence id="352">Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. </sentence><sentence id="353">But I don't want to jump ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="354">You ask me the question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Okay, well I'm not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about...We'll just get back to the chronology when... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: I don't know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. </sentence><sentence id="371">Or maybe I was brought up in a nice <span class="building">family home</span> and I didn't have any upsetting situations. </sentence><sentence id="372">But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong. </sentence><sentence id="373">And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it. </sentence><sentence id="374">So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. </sentence><sentence id="375">No? </sentence><sentence id="376">Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. </sentence><sentence id="377">But maybe the feeling that you don't give up easily. </sentence><sentence id="378">Or it's like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="379">Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to... then I was lucky that I didn't get really sick. </sentence><sentence id="380">I mean, that I don't think has anything to do with one's personality. </sentence><sentence id="381">You may be stronger, and I'm a pretty strong person. </sentence><sentence id="382">But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="383">And that I considered luck. </sentence><sentence id="384">I don't think that it's a personality. </sentence><sentence id="385">Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that. </sentence><sentence id="386">So I'm not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. </sentence><sentence id="387">I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn't me. </sentence><sentence id="388">That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can't believe and can't understand how in the world somebody can survive it. </sentence><sentence id="389">And then talk about it later in life. </sentence><sentence id="390">It's...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="903">A: See, then, in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about boys. </sentence><sentence id="904">And after I got back, it wasn't very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from my sister-in-laws. </sentence><sentence id="905">And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which he asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1800">Q: This is tape number two, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: So then we... how did we get to <span class="populated place">Louisville</span>, your question was. </sentence><sentence id="1803">A friend of Sandy's heard about a job and he was offered that job. </sentence><sentence id="1804">It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the <span class="building">Child Guidance Clinic</span> here in <span class="populated place">Louisville</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy. </sentence><sentence id="1807">And so he came to <span class="populated place">Louisville</span> and he applied for it. </sentence><sentence id="1808">And he got that job at the <span class="building">Child Guidance Clinic</span>, which was for one year only. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And that was kind of very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1810">We lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the <span class="region">South end</span>, it's where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1811">Now that was many years later. </sentence><sentence id="1812">And the people at the <span class="building">Child Guidance Clinic</span> were very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1813">They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists. </sentence><sentence id="1814">They practically took us in like a family. </sentence><sentence id="1815">They had lot of family get-togethers. </sentence><sentence id="1816">And we didn't go out otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="1817">Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954. </sentence><sentence id="1818">So we moved to <span class="populated place">Louisville</span> in "53 and we still lived in the <span class="region">South end</span> when she was born. </sentence><sentence id="1819">And our assignment was only for one year. </sentence><sentence id="1820">And now my story is really important here, but I couldn't see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And we didn't have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little. </sentence><sentence id="1822">And our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> at the <span class="building">Washington Park apartments</span> was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so. </sentence><sentence id="1823">We had to pay utilities, too. </sentence><sentence id="1824">So I told Sandy just anything he could do. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And by then I could walk to the <span class="building">grocery</span>, because it was right behind our <span class="building">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1826">I could walk, we had one <span class="spatial object">car</span>, I could walk to the pediatrician. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And I never did anything else, like go to <span class="populated place">town</span> or do that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And I said, "I wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don't have to move just exactly in September." </sentence><sentence id="1829">Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those <span class="building">seminars</span> and then people come with job opportunities. </sentence><sentence id="1830">So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And we would have had to move. </sentence><sentence id="1832">Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the <span class="building">Child Guidance Clinic</span> gave him a part time job. </sentence><sentence id="1833">And at <span class="populated place">Norton</span> he worked part time and in one other <span class="building">hospital</span> it was part time. </sentence><sentence id="1834">I mean, just very little, here and there. </sentence><sentence id="1835">Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our friends, too. </sentence><sentence id="1836">And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. </sentence><sentence id="1838">And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that's how we stayed in <span class="populated place">Louisville</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1839">He worked with them for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="1841">We're still friends. </sentence><sentence id="1842">And Linda was born in "54, so I didn't have to move away. </sentence><sentence id="1843">And then we stayed in the <span class="interior space">apartments</span> until 1957. </sentence><sentence id="1844">And we were looking for a <span class="building">house</span> and we found this and we have been here ever since. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: 1957. </sentence><sentence id="1891">So, from "53 to "57 we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1892">At that time, I didn't have my fourth child, yet. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Now there is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me. </sentence><sentence id="1894">And then... but you ask me, because I don't know what you want. </sentence><sentence id="1895">25 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1896">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1897"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0005 26 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1910">Q: Yeah, I read something about that. </sentence><sentence id="1911">I was wondering if you noticed segregation in <span class="populated place">Louisville</span> and whether that, because you had mentioned earlier that it made an impression on you that black people were treated differently than whites. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1914">A: Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when... you know I've been watching those programs all the time, but I don't remember the dates. </sentence><sentence id="1915">When was it that finally, really, for example, black people didn't have to sit on the back of the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> and all that? </sentence><sentence id="1916">Do you remember dates like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1924">A: Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the "60s. </sentence><sentence id="1925">I didn't, it didn't leave any special impression with me. </sentence><sentence id="1926">I didn't go anywhere much, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I was very busy with the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1928">And I didn't even watch, well we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">television</span> at that time, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1929">It was later. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved. </sentence><sentence id="1931">But I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do. </sentence><sentence id="1932">By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy. </sentence><sentence id="1933">And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn't really that much of a help. </sentence><sentence id="1934">He couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1935">In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Because his uncle in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> had a <span class="building">summer home</span> in <span class="populated place">Annapolis</span>, <span class="region">Maryland</span> and he offered for us to go there. </sentence><sentence id="1937">So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to <span class="populated place">Annapolis</span> by next day. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. </sentence><sentence id="1939">It wasn't really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn't a luxury. </sentence><sentence id="1940">But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> ride. </sentence><sentence id="1941">But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation. </sentence><sentence id="1942">So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that place. </sentence><sentence id="1943">But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that. </sentence><sentence id="1944">And when we come to <span class="building">schools</span> maybe, you might like to... and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the <span class="building">school</span> was nearby us here, where we live even now. </sentence><sentence id="1945">That's where he went to <span class="building">elementary school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2120">A: The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the Holocaust was enough. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And I didn't expect to have another something like this to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2122">But I handled that pretty well, too. </sentence><sentence id="2123">But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my friend's wife offered that she'1] come with me to <span class="populated place">Appleton</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2124">And I said, well maybe that's not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="2125">We left John Bell, Dr. Bell is the psychiatrist who reached <span class="populated place">Sandy</span> at the <span class="building">Atlanta airport</span> and he turned right back around on the <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2126">So my friend, his wife, took me to the <span class="building">airport</span> and we felt if he will be on that <span class="spatial object">plane</span> that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy would not come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2127">In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and Elizabeth was twelve. </sentence><sentence id="2128">But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from <span class="building">high school</span>, who was Andy's age. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And she came to stay with us for a whole year. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And that was the year that she was staying here, from <span class="populated place">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And she had a hard time to adjust, too. </sentence><sentence id="2132">She was very homesick. </sentence><sentence id="2133">But at that time she already decided she's staying. </sentence><sentence id="2134">Now, she was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was... well, I had a help in the <span class="building">house</span> too, not all the time, but a couple times a week. </sentence><sentence id="2135">So, I just packed my stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2136">I remember the kids all standing next tome. </sentence><sentence id="2137">And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And with her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. </sentence><sentence id="2139">No, I'm sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was twelve and Robert was six. </sentence><sentence id="2140">So, anyway, I said, "I just have to leave." </sentence><sentence id="2141">And I was hoping that everything will turn out okay. </sentence><sentence id="2142">And I'm still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know, of course terribly worried. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And I went to the <span class="building">airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Sandy was on that <span class="spatial object">plane</span> coming back from <span class="populated place">Atlanta</span> and we flew to <span class="populated place">Appleton</span>, <span class="region">Wisconsin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2145">It was in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="2146">We didn't know what we were going to find. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2148">somebody took us into the <span class="building">hospital</span> and Andy was under all kind of <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And he was in a coma actually for about three days, completely out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2150">And Sandy stayed with me until he was coming to, and... not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And one very important story I must tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2152">The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the <span class="populated place">Appleton</span> paper. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And somebody called the <span class="building">hospital</span> and wanted to meet the parents of this young boy. </sentence><sentence id="2154">And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they were already older and out of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And they came to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and not even knowing me or Sandy, they offered their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2156">They lived pretty close to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2157">That I could stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="2158">And they were wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2159">And now see, something like that makes me cry. </sentence><sentence id="2160">I was there for six weeks and I could walk from the <span class="building">hospital</span> to their <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2161">The kids were out of her <span class="building">house</span> already, so she had a place. </sentence><sentence id="2162">I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2163">And otherwise I spent the whole day in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2164">See the result of all this was, that eventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. </sentence><sentence id="2165">But we didn't know that for a long time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2166">I don't know if you know anybody, when people are this sick, that for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2167">It doesn't mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="2168">But sometimes I would talk to them on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2169">See Sandy stayed for a little while and then he went back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2170">So, I talked to them on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> all the time and 28 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2171"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2184">At Christmas time or holiday time, they came, all of them, to <span class="populated place">Appleton</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And that's the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2795">Q: Did there come a point when you felt that you had to talk about your experiences, your memories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2797">A: Well it came after, many years later. </sentence><sentence id="2798">The very first time, I think I talked about it, that we were going to <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span>, to an <span class="building">art gallery</span>, and Mary K. was with me and another friend. </sentence><sentence id="2799">It was a two hour ride and somehow it came up and then I told them. </sentence><sentence id="2800">When I used to walk with neighbors and friends and they have known me forever. </sentence><sentence id="2801">So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe 45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2802">So, I said, "I'll be glad to," and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and then they wanted to know the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="2803">So, by now it doesn't give me any problems to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2804">When some of the <span class="building">schools</span> ask me, I did. </sentence><sentence id="2805">I couldn't begin to tell you now how many times I did speak in <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2806">Once at the <span class="building">Catherine Spalding College</span>, once at <span class="building">St. Andrews Church</span> and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And they might have a Jewish student there or not. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And now, I'm completely at ease with myself and I can talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2809">Once ina while I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2823">Q: Did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2825">A: And I'm glad that I can, because Sandy's sister, the one who is coming from <span class="country">Argentina</span> now, she completely held it back all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2826">So much that if the subject comes up, she just completely bursts out crying. </sentence><sentence id="2827">She couldn't talk to her kids about it... they know... or to her grandchildren about it. </sentence><sentence id="2828">And her granddaughter said, "Why don't you make a tape of it," because she was with me one year. </sentence><sentence id="2829">Sylvia, she's now about twenty some years old. </sentence><sentence id="2830">She told her grandmother, "Why don't you make a tape of it? </sentence><sentence id="2831">Maybe it would be easier for you." </sentence><sentence id="2832">And everybody tells this to everybody, but it's not easy to do. </sentence><sentence id="2833">I would have never just done it, if Mary K. wouldn't have insisted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2843">Q: Was it important to you, personally to do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2845">A: I, I, it's nice. </sentence><sentence id="2846">Like, for example, I have a neighbor two <span class="building">houses</span> down, who is from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and who left <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, they took all of her things away. </sentence><sentence id="2847">And she ended up in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2848">I said, "Why don't you tell your story?" </sentence><sentence id="2849">She can not. </sentence><sentence id="2850">And all alone, unless somebody asks you, it's very hard to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2851">But I'm glad. </sentence><sentence id="2852">I am glad that I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2853">And I'm glad that there is a record of it, maybe for the future generation. </sentence><sentence id="2854">I mean, I don't care whether I would have it or not, but... so, I think it's... and that's why they make such a big deal about that now. </sentence><sentence id="2855">Of course, a lot of people go back with <span class="spatial object">transports</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and so I don't have any desire to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2921">A: Well for a while, no, not really. </sentence><sentence id="2922">We lived in the <span class="region">South end</span> and we didn't, some people through his work would come and look us up and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2923">When we moved to this <span class="building">house</span>, then we met more and more people and they would invite us. </sentence><sentence id="2924">But we're not the type that we congregate only that they have to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2925">As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person, I would never want to have anything to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="2926">But that's not the kind of friends we ever would have. </sentence><sentence id="2927">And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I mean it's not a problem anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2928">And our kids, too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends and Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="2929">Now, my son, Robert, in <span class="populated place">Nashville</span>, he married a Catholic girl. </sentence><sentence id="2930">Now, he is the least. </sentence><sentence id="2931">He's the one who came with me to <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2932">And he said that he learned more about Andy during that three hour memorial service than he ever knew, because he was just a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="2933">And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to <span class="building">college</span> and then he moved to <span class="populated place">Cal</span>... so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And it made a very big impression on him. </sentence><sentence id="2935">We got through music or through the <span class="building">universities</span> or through work, that we made friends, you know, but it.... and some of them are Jewish, some of them are not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2936">So it's... we have some very, very good friends, who we still get together sometimes, have dinner out. </sentence><sentence id="2937">He's almost ninety years old. </sentence><sentence id="2938">And on their second marriage and they're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2939">So, it's not a matter that it has to be Jewish or not, but it has to be the same type of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2959">Q: I'm going to say something about...
