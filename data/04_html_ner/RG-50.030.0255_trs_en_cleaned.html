<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell me about your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: My father owned a <span class="building">pharmacy</span> in <span class="populated place">Baden-Baden</span>, and he and my mother had three children. </sentence><sentence id="20">I have one sister who lives here in <span class="region">New Jersey</span>, and my older sister passed away a few years ago in <span class="country">Majorca</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">We had a good youth, a very nice up-bringing. </sentence><sentence id="22">I went to <span class="building">primary school</span> for three years. </sentence><sentence id="23">I, after that I entered the <span class="building">Gymnasium</span> for nine years and received baccalaureate. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="24">By that time, the political situa...the political situation in <span class="country">Germany</span> wasn't too rosy and there was a lot of unemployment. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was supposed to enter a <span class="building">pharmacy</span> in the <span class="region">province</span> as an apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="26">But when I was ready, they were not in a position to accept me anymore. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="27">Because the uh Nazis, while not in power yet, had quite some influence and everybody was afraid to accept a Jewish apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="28">As far as my Jewish upbringing, there was none. </sentence><sentence id="29">My parents were quite assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="30">And Jewish religion, never. </sentence><sentence id="31">We just... nothing there was said. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">And I became more aware of my religion only through the Nazi revo...uh Nazi... Not revolution. </sentence><sentence id="33">I mean, when they came into power. </sentence><sentence id="34">In 1932, after matriculation, I left my <span class="populated place">home town</span> for <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">We had had an exchange program with a family in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Nyon</span> on the <span class="env feature">Lake of Geneva</span>, and there were still about six weeks that they owed us. </sentence><sentence id="36">So I spent six weeks there. </sentence><sentence id="37">And after that, through some friends and through a <span class="building">office</span> of the League of Nations, I got a job on a <span class="dlf">farm</span> in uh <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, on a...behind the <span class="populated place">city</span>, the <span class="populated place">town</span>, of <span class="populated place">Vevey</span>, on <span class="env feature">Lake</span>...on the Lake of <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was tough times there. </sentence><sentence id="39">If I had had the money to go back <span class="building">home</span> after I had arrived there, I would probably have turned around and gone back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="40">Instead of that, I had to get up about five o'clock in the morning to start cleaning the pig's sty and then the cows and then the horses. </sentence><sentence id="41">And everybody spoke French and I didn't know that much French when I got there, but I quickly had to learn whether I liked it or not. </sentence><sentence id="42">I stayed there for about two months and then the farmer sent me with a...with one man and about twenty cows up in the <span class="env feature">Alps</span> where he had <span class="env feature">meadows</span> and I stayed there for another two months "til the beginning of September of "32. </sentence><sentence id="43">Yeah, 1932. </sentence><sentence id="44">By that time, uh my father had been able to get me an apprenticeship in a <span class="building">mechanical factory</span> in the <span class="region">Black Forest</span> which was owned by friends of his. </sentence><sentence id="45">I went through a two year apprenticeship, commercial apprenticeship, the end of which I had to go through an examination for commercial  assistance by the <span class="building">Chamber of Commerce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">Fortunately, during that time, the after (ph)  mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="47">I had brought a <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span> with me and a pair of <span class="spatial object">skis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">Nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="49">The pair of <span class="spatial object">skis</span> was to show that I was a student. </sentence><sentence id="50">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport. </sentence><sentence id="51">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in <span class="country">Greece</span>--in the <span class="region">Peloponnese</span>--which was nice. </sentence><sentence id="52">I got various jobs in <span class="country">Greece</span> and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage. </sentence><sentence id="53">I worked in a <span class="building">technical office</span> where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="54">They considered very small as <span class="region">outside of Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">I think at that time I worked for them for three years. </sentence><sentence id="56">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a <span class="building">newspaper distributing office</span> to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting. </sentence><sentence id="57">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) <span class="building">newspaper agency</span>, took me to the office of the <span class="building">foreign newspaper</span>  one <span class="building">foreign consulate</span> to the other in <span class="populated place">Athens</span> to try and get a place to uh go to. </sentence><sentence id="58">And this was quite difficult. </sentence><sentence id="59">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to <span class="country">Paraguay</span> but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back. </sentence><sentence id="60">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in <span class="populated place">Athens</span> - we found a man in the <span class="building">British Embassy</span> who helped to get us out. </sentence><sentence id="61">His connection through the <span class="building">CID</span> caused them to check our family tree. </sentence><sentence id="62">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span> after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already. </sentence><sentence id="63">They told us we could proceed any place in the <span class="country">British Empire</span> we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so. </sentence><sentence id="64">Closest place was the island of <span class="country">Cyprus</span>; but <span class="country">Cyprus</span> required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash. </sentence><sentence id="65">We didn't have that kind of money. </sentence><sentence id="66">So the British Ambassador in <span class="populated place">Athens</span> caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="67">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I managed to go to the two main <span class="building">employers</span> I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money. </sentence><sentence id="69">So we put that on an account in <span class="country">Cyprus</span>, and we were...we managed to go back to <span class="country">Cyprus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">Half a year later, I could send them the money back. </sentence><sentence id="71">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="72">We arrived in <span class="country">Cyprus</span> in the beginning of March of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="73">And in uh...in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Limassol</span>, my father promptly got sick. </sentence><sentence id="74">We were stuck there in a small <span class="building">hotel</span> for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="75">After that we moved to the capital of <span class="country">Cyprus</span>, <span class="populated place">Nicosia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">I got a job in an <span class="building">import office</span>, and my sister got a job in another...in a <span class="building">technical office</span> also. </sentence><sentence id="77">But in September of "39, when <span class="country">Italy</span> entered the war, I came to my <span class="building">office</span> and I found a note in the <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span>: "Do not come back." </sentence><sentence id="78">Because <span class="building">business</span> was dead; and besides, that he told me after he was not to employee enemy aliens. </sentence><sentence id="79">I then got work in a small <span class="building">sausage factory</span> which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees. </sentence><sentence id="80">They needed somebody who spoke Greek and English, because neither of one did...uh of them did. </sentence><sentence id="81">And for some weeks, I sold sausage-- much to the embarrassment of my parents, who would never come to the <span class="building">store</span> but who liked to eat the sausage I brought <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">After that, thanks to the Commissioner in <span class="populated place">Nicosia</span>, the British Commissioner, I got a job in the <span class="dlf">asbestos mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">They didn't know anything about asbestos was dangerous, and thank God it didn't do any harm to me. </sentence><sentence id="84">But uh I went up there. </sentence><sentence id="85">I worked in the <span class="building">bookkeeping department</span> for, I think, it's only about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="86">And eventually the uh director of the <span class="dlf">mine</span> put a <span class="building">house</span> at my disposal, and my parents and my sister could come up there to stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="87">Because in the meantime, things had gotten worse politically. </sentence><sentence id="88">And uh when the Germans overrun <span class="country">Greece</span> I think every refugee and every person who had arrived in...on <span class="country">Cyprus</span> with German papers was interned. </sentence><sentence id="89">They opened an <span class="populated place">internment camp</span> right next to the <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>, for the men only. </sentence><sentence id="90">Women they left alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">And in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> were mostly Jews--maybe about twenty real Germans who were kept strictly to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="92">Was not a very good time, because that we were staying in <span class="building">tents</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the <span class="env feature">air</span> and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was more or less in charge of that, again because I knew the languages and somewhere . . . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: They did not feed you? </sentence><sentence id="96">You had to... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: No, well they told us what... "Here's what you get every week. </sentence><sentence id="98">You make your own menu." </sentence><sentence id="99">And I still have somewhere menus or a menu. </sentence><sentence id="100">I don't have it with me, but if I find it I'll make a copy. </sentence><sentence id="101">So that kept me busy. </sentence><sentence id="102">Besides that, they gave us a couple of packets of cigarettes every day. </sentence><sentence id="103">And due to the fact that my father was a heavy smoker, I stopped smoking at that time. </sentence><sentence id="104">He got my cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh after about a month in that <span class="populated place">tent camp</span>, the authorities realized that that was not a good place to leave us because people got sick. </sentence><sentence id="106">And they moved the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to a <span class="building">hotel</span> up in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> of <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">Beautiful place called [<span class="populated place">Berengaria</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="108">And it was naturally behind <span class="dlf">fence</span>, <span class="dlf">wire fence</span>; but otherwise it was just like a vacation. </sentence><sentence id="109">What I mean is there was a <span class="populated place">village</span> nearby, and all the ladies rented <span class="interior space">rooms</span> there to come and visit. </sentence><sentence id="110">And at the same time, the government started checking the individual papers of the people they had caught up in their <span class="dlf">net</span> of internment. </sentence><sentence id="111">My father was one of the first to be released. </sentence><sentence id="112">And about three weeks later, I was let go. </sentence><sentence id="113">And I went back to my work in the <span class="building">asbestos mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">We all went back there, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: What was <span class="country">Cyprus</span> like...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: <span class="country">Cyprus</span> was a beautiful place, actually. </sentence><sentence id="136">At that time, the British had about two hundred troops on <span class="country">Cyprus</span>--which kept the peace between Turkish and Greek inhabitants. </sentence><sentence id="137">I saw quite a bit of <span class="country">Cyprus</span> while moving around. </sentence><sentence id="138">There have beautiful <span class="env feature">beaches</span>, and the uh <span class="populated place">city</span> or the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Nicosia</span> had some amazing Gothic architecture in their <span class="building">churches</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: I guess what I'm asking--excuse me--is not so much physically what the <span class="env feature">island</span> is like, but what was it like in wartime--under war conditions--for a Jew living in <span class="country">Cyprus</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Things were rationed, for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="146">And uh the Jews, Jewish refugees--thanks also to the internship--they got to know each other, and they drew together. </sentence><sentence id="147">There was no organization yet at that time. </sentence><sentence id="148">But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="149">But we knew quite a few people, and uh we attended uh services which was to some extent a first for me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="150">Naturally, after moving up to the <span class="building">asbestos mine</span> I had no connection ...we had no connection. </sentence><sentence id="151">We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician, who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="152">Also did not come on the evacuations. </sentence><sentence id="153">But he and my father got friendly, so... And I had no time to be friendly. </sentence><sentence id="154">After all, there were also rules that after work, after sundown, none of us were allowed to leave the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">That was strict instructions, and uh it was known in <span class="populated place">community</span> in the <span class="building">asbestos mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">So we stayed, and we had a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">That was that. </sentence><sentence id="158">I only...there was only one <span class="building">store</span> in the whole place, and I went there to buy our ration. </sentence><sentence id="159">Every week we had a half a pound of butter, which my father got because at that time nobody thought that there was anything wrong with eating butter. </sentence><sentence id="160">And we were quite lonely. </sentence><sentence id="161">I wrote during that time in German a treaty [NB: treatise] on my stay in <span class="populated place">Athens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">One of these days, I might translate it. </sentence><sentence id="163">And we stayed there until June "41. </sentence><sentence id="164">We, naturally, knew what was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="165">But <span class="country">Cyprus</span>, being away from everything, we did not pay too much attention until the Nazis invaded <span class="populated place">Crete</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">They got the island of Crete  without any difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then, suddenly, the good inhabitants of <span class="country">Cyprus</span> became very anxious to learn German. </sentence><sentence id="168">Under the leadership of their bishop, a man Makarios--who afterwards what became President of the <span class="region">Greek part</span> of <span class="country">Cyprus</span>--they became very uh friendly towards the expected German invasion. </sentence><sentence id="169">And we were worried. </sentence><sentence id="170">Then uh in June of "41, my father got a <span class="dlf">wire</span> that he should be ready for evacuation within four days in the <span class="populated place">capital</span>, <span class="populated place">Nicosia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">He had no money saved, because we were living from hand to mouth on whatever little money I made. </sentence><sentence id="172">So in this twen...within twenty-four hours, we had a big sale of all our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="173">We found that for evacuation we only...we are allowed to take two pieces of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> each, and no more <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> than each one of us could carry. </sentence><sentence id="174">Now we...during the short hours, we had to decide what to pack. </sentence><sentence id="175">We had to try and buy some pieces of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> from people there, and we had to be so that we had some money in  During these air raids we would meet. </sentence><sentence id="176">Because my father was staying with one family, my mother with another, my sister with another, and I with another. </sentence><sentence id="177">In the evening, everybody went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> in the air raid...<span class="building">air raid shelter</span>, and everybody along came. </sentence><sentence id="178">That was when we met, at night. </sentence><sentence id="179">Was scary so...because we knew that people actually had died during the week or so before. </sentence><sentence id="180">We didn't stay with these people too long, because when my father discovered that his friend had been killed he also heard from the widow and who had immediately left <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> for <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">She sent my father the key to their <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">And we stayed for the rest of our stay in <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> in a beautiful <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on <span class="dlf">Gordon Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">The only...the drawback was that the lady during that time started selling off her <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">So every day there was less there. </sentence><sentence id="185">Eventually we just had <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> and our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">But from June through the end of November, to the middle of November, we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="187">During that time, the uh British government paid everyone who was a member of the <span class="country">Cyprus</span> evacuation, paid them every two weeks enough money to live on. </sentence><sentence id="188">But they were not allowed to work. </sentence><sentence id="189">They had to present themselves every two weeks at an <span class="building">office</span> in the <span class="building">Jewish Agency</span> to get the money. </sentence><sentence id="190">Quite a few vanished. </sentence><sentence id="191">They had family in <span class="country">Palestine</span>, as it was then, and decided, "Well, goodbye." </sentence><sentence id="192">They stayed there, and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="193">They...in the meantime, the English decided what to do with the rest. </sentence><sentence id="194">There were about three hundred and fifty or so left, and they divided us up into two main groups. </sentence><sentence id="195">One to go to what was then <span class="populated place">Nyasaland</span> [Now: <span class="country">Malawi</span>], and the other one <span class="populated place">Tanganyika</span> [Now: <span class="country">Tanzania</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="196">So we knew our destiny. </sentence><sentence id="197">And there again, we subdivided the Tanganyika group to those who were going to stay in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> there, and others who would stay in a small group in a <span class="populated place">town</span>--which was what we selected. </sentence><sentence id="198">And we were told that we would have to proceed to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>, <span class="populated place">M-W-A-N-Z - A</span>, on the shore of <span class="env feature">Lake Victoria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was a long way off, because the trip has to...had to be arranged. </sentence><sentence id="200">So in middle of November, finally, we were told everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="201">We got travel papers showing that we were...we had no other papers, and that we were to proceed to <span class="country">Tanganyika</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">And one hundred and seventy of us--that was the group to go to Tanganyika-- were put on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span> to <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">At that time, there was a <span class="dlf">rail line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">And they put us up in a <span class="building">hotel</span> in <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Whoa. </sentence><sentence id="266">Let's not move quite so fast, OK? </sentence><sentence id="267">There are a hundred and seventy of you. </sentence><sentence id="268">Uh, you are put on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> at <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Uh, describe that <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride for us, would you, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="276">There were both enough <span class="interior space">room</span>... I don't remember how many <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>, but it was a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">And uh <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>...in <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>, they put us on <span class="spatial object">buses</span> to a <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: What was <span class="populated place">Cairo</span> like at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Very busy. </sentence><sentence id="284">It was full of soldiers--Australians, New Zealanders, British. </sentence><sentence id="285">And uh the uh people who received us there tried to show us as much of <span class="populated place">Cairo</span> as possible. </sentence><sentence id="286">We never knew whether this was a one-day stop there or two-day stop there. </sentence><sentence id="287">As it turned out, we were there for six or seven days. </sentence><sentence id="288">And we had an opportunity to visit the <span class="building">pyramids</span>, to see the uh <span class="building">mosques</span>, and to see the amazing traffic in <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">I recall the flat uh <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span>, drawn by horses or mules, where black-dressed women were sitting in rows just on the flat <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">That was some rich Egyptian, I guess, uh took his women for a ride. </sentence><sentence id="291">Otherwise, I don't recall  much of <span class="populated place">Cairo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">It's a picturesque <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">But we were constantly worried, "What next?" </sentence><sentence id="294">They finally took us to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> again, and took us by <span class="spatial object">train</span>--<span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">It was a special <span class="spatial object">train</span>, as far as I remember, to <span class="populated place">Port Taufiq</span>, on the <span class="env feature">Red Sea</span>, on the <span class="dlf">exit</span> of the <span class="dlf">canal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">And there, we were put on a <span class="spatial object">Belgian passenger ship</span> that was full of Australian and New Zealand troops on vacations. </sentence><sentence id="297">They were...we had one part of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>; but naturally there was...we were mingled. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was...it was still blackout, which made it difficult to move around on that <span class="spatial

were far enough away from the German and <span class="spatial object">Italian planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">So he lifted the blackout for a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="302">Because then came the news of the Japanese uh attack on <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span>." </sentence><sentence id="303">That was that day. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we were all shivering in our boots, because we expected that they had nothing better to do but on the way out of the <span class="env feature">Red Sea</span> there would be some <span class="spatial object">Japanese ship</span> waiting to sink this <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">Because it was a <span class="spatial object">military transport</span>, after all. </sentence><sentence id="306">And we were scared. </sentence><sentence id="307">The blackout was enforced more than ever. </sentence><sentence id="308">We went through the <span class="env feature">Red Sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">We went past <span class="populated place">Mombasa</span> [NB: in <span class="country">Kenya</span>], and the <span class="spatial

were to stay in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> left. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had established a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in a former <span class="building">German prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Tabora</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313"><span class="populated place">Tanganyika</span>, naturally, had been a <span class="populated place">German colony</span> before the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="314">The rest of us went to <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">We arrived there a few days before Christmas in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="316">And there were about twelve...between twelve and seventeen--I don't recall exactly how many--we were put up in a <span class="building">hotel</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="317">There was only one <span class="building">hotel</span> owned by a very nice and fat Greek man, who was glad find somebody who spoke Greek. </sentence><sentence id="318">And the District Commissioner of the <span class="region">Lake Province of Tanganyika</span> showed up next day to assure everybody that they uh they would continue paying everybody for as long as the war lasted, if necessary, but urging us to see if we couldn't find some work. </sentence><sentence id="319">And there were indeed people, and I remember one couple that did not look for work. </sentence><sentence id="320">They stayed in that <span class="building">hotel</span> for five years. </sentence><sentence id="321">They were paid for five years. </sentence><sentence id="322">And, naturally, when the war was over, the uh British government was obligated to bring everybody who wanted to back to <span class="country">Cyprus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">Now, I couldn't stand doing nothing. </sentence><sentence id="324">And thanks to the man who owned the <span class="building">hotel</span>, I got some work in the <span class="building">recruiting office</span> of a <span class="dlf">gold mine</span> in <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">They had...they sent recruiters out to the various chiefs and got people to work. </sentence><sentence id="326">And they came to the <span class="building">office</span> where I was, and I had to give them tickets to go on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> across <span class="env feature">Lake Victoria</span> to the <span class="dlf">gold mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">That lasted about a month maybe, not much longer. </sentence><sentence id="328">After that one day I came back to, for lunch to the <span class="building">hotel</span> and the Greek owner introduced me to a South African miner. </sentence><sentence id="329">He told me this man, this man has mining claims and he comes here every few weeks because he has to submit renewal applications for the claims to the <span class="building">Inspector of Mines</span> who was located in <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">But he told me the man had so much to drink he can't draw a straight <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">Please help him. </sentence><sentence id="332">I helped him, drew him a map for as he told me of his <span class="dlf">mine</span>, and before he left he told me I could come to the <span class="dlf">mine</span> to work for him at I think it was ten pounds a month. </sentence><sentence id="333">Anyhow it was much more than I was earning at that other place. </sentence><sentence id="334">It was about a hundred miles south of <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">And he gave me some money, which he thought at that time was payment for my efforts; but he didn't say that. </sentence><sentence id="336">He  said, "Here. </sentence><sentence id="337">Whatever you need, when you...when you are ready to come." </sentence><sentence id="338">And he was very surprised when I showed up at his mine. </sentence><sentence id="339">Before that, he had gotten so drunk not knowing what he did himself that I had to run away from him. </sentence><sentence id="340">He was, in his mind, under the impression that I was chasing his wife. </sentence><sentence id="341">And was quite an experience. </sentence><sentence id="342">I had to run away. </sentence><sentence id="343">And he was drunk, but he wasn't drunk enough to give up the chase. </sentence><sentence id="344">And...but finally, he did so. </sentence><sentence id="345">And uh the next day, he was all sorry and full of excuses. </sentence><sentence id="346">And I went to the District Commissioner and said, "Look here, what kind of man is that? </sentence><sentence id="347">He wants me to work for him. </sentence><sentence id="348">But if that's what happens, I'm scared." </sentence><sentence id="349">But the uh District Commissioner, whose name I have somewhere, uh assured me that I needn't worry. </sentence><sentence id="350">And the same of the Police Commissioner there. </sentence><sentence id="351">So I used the paper that that miner had given me to obtain a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> from the...from one of the Indian merchants in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, and I set out for the <span class="dlf">mine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">I stayed in the <span class="region">mining area</span> for..."til September of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="353">I did about everything connected with diamond mining, except the actual digging. </sentence><sentence id="354">It sounds very interesting now, but was tough in the heat and long hours. </sentence><sentence id="355">Eventually I got malaria. </sentence><sentence id="356">I got Black Water Fever. </sentence><sentence id="357">Ended up in the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span> with Black Water Fever, and a friendly doctor told me only about twenty-five percent of Europeans who get Black Water Fever survive. </sentence><sentence id="358">Fortunately, I was amongst the twenty-five percent. </sentence><sentence id="359">In the meantime, my father had been able to get a job in his profession as pharmacist, in <span class="populated place">Mwanza</span>, at the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">He was in charge of the pharmacy of the <span
