<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: You say that you grew up in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and certainly, when your life was disrupted, you were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong, when the last place you were was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="17">How did you grow up, what happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who was that boy or boy adult when the <span class="populated place">camps</span> were liberated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very little from that period. </sentence><sentence id="21">I was born in 1934, so in "39 I was five years old. </sentence><sentence id="22">I was a scared little boy, that's all I remember. </sentence><sentence id="23">I remember our crossing the <span class="dlf">border</span> from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="country">Poland</span> and worrying that something would happen to my father and knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to happen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="24">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="25"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 4 November 28, 1995 Page 4 first time in my life in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the war and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably 1943, because in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, when they dissolved the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and sent most of the people to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: This is in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: This is in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my parents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="42">And in "43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my parents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="43">And then, of course, when I was left -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Such as? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a <span class="populated place">work camp</span>, and when that <span class="populated place">camp</span> was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then what happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up on one of these <span class="dlf">fields</span> in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me back. </sentence><sentence id="52">And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in front of everybody, and said to him, "This is my son." </sentence><sentence id="53">And this man looked at me, and I said to him, in German, "I can work." </sentence><sentence id="54">And, you know, it just came out of me. </sentence><sentence id="55">How do you say it in German? " </sentence><sentence id="56">Ich kann arbeiten"? </sentence><sentence id="57">And his response in German This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="58">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="59"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 5 November 28, 1995 Page 5 was "Na, das wollen wir mal sehen" -- "Let's see" -- and he let me live. </sentence><sentence id="60">This was -- I was the only one of the children from that -- from <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> who survived that way. </sentence><sentence id="61">There were two others who hid in the <span class="building">house</span> where they took all of the children. </sentence><sentence id="62">And that was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have to save my own life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right into the belly of the beast. </sentence><sentence id="81">You went right face-to-face with the danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of analyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways and that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the reality. </sentence><sentence id="85">Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke German, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from <span class="building">Der Stiirmer</span>, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="86">And suddenly to have this kid talk to them, it personalized it. </sentence><sentence id="87">And I think this was my father's -- he sort of contributed to my doing what I did. </sentence><sentence id="88">He must have said himself, "You have to." </sentence><sentence id="89">Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, "You have to tell them you can work." </sentence><sentence id="90">It could well be, but it worked. </sentence><sentence id="91">And after that, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> again, the first time, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had known before, because it was a man who had been in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with us in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> and was shipped out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> two years before we did. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, by the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="93">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="94"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 6 November 28, 1995 Page 6 time we came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. </sentence><sentence id="95">But he treated his friends well, and he sort of took me in. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was a terrible sort of society, to live. </sentence><sentence id="97">But that helped. </sentence><sentence id="98">I also -- in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran that <span class="populated place">work camp</span>, and I must -- I don't know how that came about. </sentence><sentence id="99">But what I remember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit outside his <span class="building">office</span> and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort of report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. </sentence><sentence id="100">So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they didn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="125">What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how did you cope with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was a very, he was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="130">He never mistreated me. </sentence><sentence id="131">But he was quite brutal. </sentence><sentence id="132">He would beat people if he saw them not working. </sentence><sentence id="133">And so I figured out he would do that and so when he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make certain motions. </sentence><sentence id="134">He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="135">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="136"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28, 1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working. </sentence><sentence id="137">But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused me, never mistreated me. </sentence><sentence id="138">That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to have a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, and he would hand me the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, to take the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and put it in the <span class="spatial object">bicycle stand</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">And believe it or not, in all this <span class="region">environment</span> in which we lived, I learned to ride the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> with this SS man's <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">You know, a child is a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the <span class="building">tent</span> and see you playing with the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as long as I didn't break it, I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="161">You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear factor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing this or doing that. </sentence><sentence id="162">Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not because I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was any reason to be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="163">There were many reasons in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to be afraid, but not to these sort of episodes. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day -- I remember breaking in with a friend of mine in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> of the SS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in two years. </sentence><sentence id="165">And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it sort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="174"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="175">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="176"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="177"> Thomas Buergenthal 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="178"> November 28, 1995 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179"> Page 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="180"> be chosen to go into the <span class="building">crematorium</span>? </sentence><sentence id="181">After all, you saw this happen often, every day. </sentence><sentence id="182">Did you imagine that happening to you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Well, first of all, beaten. </sentence><sentence id="184">You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the <span class="dlf">food line</span>, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing really very serious. </sentence><sentence id="185">No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there, that was a reality. </sentence><sentence id="186">And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed and I knew exactly what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="187">As a matter of fact, I was in situations where I thought I was finished, there was no way out. </sentence><sentence id="188">No, that fear, and that fear was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="189">Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing more to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over me, I thought I was going to die. </sentence><sentence id="190">I had done everything possible not to get caught and there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that point. </sentence><sentence id="191">But it didn't last very long. </sentence><sentence id="192">You know, the survival instinct comes right back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. </sentence><sentence id="204">Where were you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I was at liberation, in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> which is about 20 kilometers outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">And by that time I had survived the death march but lost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an <span class="building">infirmary</span> of <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">They had sort of a <span class="building">hospital</span> set up, because it was one of these <span class="populated place">model camps</span>, <span class="populated place">demonstration camps</span>, where they would keep people and could show that they were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="210">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="211"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 9 November 28, 1995 Page 9 actually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do everything else. </sentence><sentence id="212">But it was a <span class="populated place">model camp</span>, and I was there. </sentence><sentence id="213">I had two toes amputated. </sentence><sentence id="214">And then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were much sicker than I, we were left behind in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">And the assumption was that they were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="217">I was able to move. </sentence><sentence id="218">I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I think I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. </sentence><sentence id="219">It was strange, after the evacuation of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it was very strange but it was very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="220">And then you begin to hear artillery fire coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="221">And I think I went to sleep, evacuation must have been the day before. </sentence><sentence id="222">The next morning I got up and it was very, very quiet except for the shooting coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="223">I crawled out, went out and looked up and saw in the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, over the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> on the inside -- they always had a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there, the machine gun was empty. </sentence><sentence id="224">I came back and told people. </sentence><sentence id="225">Of course, nobody believed that this was happening. </sentence><sentence id="226">And then we just waited and the shooting came closer. </sentence><sentence id="227">Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> had a big bell in the middle of this <span class="dlf">field</span>, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> and was ringing the bell saying, "You're free." </sentence><sentence id="228">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="229">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="230"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28, 1995 Page 10 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: In what language? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="265">It must have been in <span class="country">Russian</span>, but Russian and Polish is relatively close. </sentence><sentence id="266">And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you go the other way. </sentence><sentence id="267">And the first thing that we did was to storm the place with the SS kept their supplies. </sentence><sentence id="268">And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick and everybody dragged themselves to the <span class="dlf">supply place</span> and people began to eat. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="270">I remember finding a pickle. </sentence><sentence id="271">There was bread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. </sentence><sentence id="272">It probably saved my life because a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged themselves and got quite sick and many of them died. </sentence><sentence id="273">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="274">I just couldn't swallow. </sentence><sentence id="275">And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his early 20s and I--we -- decided we were going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="276">So we just went out on the <span class="dlf">road</span> and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were some women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. </sentence><sentence id="277">And we -- the <span class="building">houses</span> -- this was the <span class="populated place">city</span> of where the <span class="populated place">camp</span> is, <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, is <span class="populated place">Oranienberg</span>, and we must have been in the <span class="region">area</span> of that, moving away from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">The <span class="building">German houses</span> were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often times the <span class="spatial object">tables</span> were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a <span class="building">house</span> and we just moved from one <span class="building">house</span> to the other, until these Polish soldiers This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="279">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="280"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 11 November 28, 1995 Page 11 came and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. </sentence><sentence id="281">And then they saw me and they said, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="282">I said that I didn't know where I was going, I was trying to find my parents. </sentence><sentence id="283">And they said, "Well where they would be?" </sentence><sentence id="284">And I said, "They would probably be in <span class="country">Poland</span>," and so they took me with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Let's go back a couple steps. </sentence><sentence id="311">I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was that scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. </sentence><sentence id="312">Did people come out and stand around, then did you guys hug each other? </sentence><sentence id="313">Was there a feeling that you were really liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by British troops, they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="319">We were none of these scenes as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="320">The Russians just told us, "You can go." </sentence><sentence id="321">There was no effort made to help us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. </sentence><sentence id="322">I don't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be shot, but none of that -- it was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. </sentence><sentence id="323">It was hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="324">No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="325">I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the <span class="env feature">air</span>, and it came, sort of, on my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="326">But I didn't have any sense of the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. </sentence><sentence id="327">I was alone in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="328">I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different. </sentence><sentence id="329">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="330">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="331"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 12 November 28, 1995 Page 12 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving around in the <span class="populated place">town</span> outside of <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, did you feel frightened that Germans could come up and recapture you, perhaps? </sentence><sentence id="350">What was the mood like, or were you just sitting back with your feet up on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> in these <span class="building">homes</span> and having a nice time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: When you describe yourself being in the group of the tough orphans, it sounds like when you were young, when you were ten and just coming out of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, there was almost a certain amount of pride, that you had survived and that you could handle yourself in these situations. </sentence><sentence id="788">Almost kind of the feelings of a young man and after all you were still a little boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="871">Q: How much did people ask you about what your life had been like, for instance, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and did you have a feeling that they were trying to find out information perhaps for later, for war crime trials or perhaps just to comfort you, to see if you'd experienced any trauma? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: Well, in the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, since I was the only one there who had been in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, the people from newspapers and newsreels would come, and I was sort of a minor celebrity. </sentence><sentence id="874">Whenever people would come to the <span class="building">orphanage</span> I would be trotted out to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="875">But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just somebody -- if they wanted to talk about the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, this was an example. </sentence><sentence id="876">Actually, you probably know that there was a book written, a diary in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the man who wrote that diary and the excerpts from the diary, the parts that deal with me, he asked a lot of those questions. </sentence><sentence id="877">And when he describes interviewing me in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="878">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="879"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 27 November 28, 1995 Page 27 <span class="building">hospital</span> about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he was struck by the fact that it was all sort of reported in the matter of fact way. </sentence><sentence id="880">I -- it's still like this to this day, I think in part because of my age or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to the experience but not very introspective about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: And now I do. </sentence><sentence id="898">No -- and he described them as very nervous hands and I suppose they still are probably to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="899">No, he was the only one in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I remember asking me about things. </sentence><sentence id="900">And I was even -- I sort of thought, how strange that somebody would ask me about these things since we were all living it and there was nothing very unusual about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: You say that often you describe things in a matter-of-fact way. </sentence><sentence id="930">I wonder though that kind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about seeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many bodies in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="931">Is that something that became matter of fact for you also? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1280">A: No, because actually, even though my grandparent's <span class="building">house</span> still stood, my grandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in a nice <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span> and life suddenly became normal after all of those years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1282">Q: And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in another sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his way in the middle of this war. </sentence><sentence id="1283">How did she react to that? </sentence><sentence id="1284">You must have been very independent by that point, not her little boy anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: I don't know whether that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="1290">But it's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of <span class="building">school</span> and all of this -- and I had a year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher, and he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense and a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the same with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you know -- where was this, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1292">But I was a child, I played, I did everything. </sentence><sentence id="1293">I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 -- how old was I? </sentence><sentence id="1294">14, 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I couldn't speak German too well. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Again, this was sort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1297">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1298"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Thomas Buergenthal 39 November 28, 1995 Page 39 spoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be fluent again in German even though at <span class="building">home</span> we used to speak German and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I spoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with my father when we were alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1316">Q: And so there was a kind of -- let's catch up and what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Where you did sort of sit down and just really debrief with each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1320">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1322">The truth of the matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that happened that were funny, about this or that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1323">So the human spirit -- you couldn't take all this if it were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So my wife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother and I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often and remember this funny thing, and remember this. </sentence><sentence id="1325">It wasn't only remembering the terrible things that had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I imagine it was probably when I was little we talked more about those things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2308">A: Well, first of all, it should be sort of written down for the family. </sentence><sentence id="2309">What strikes me about this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I mean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early 30s, they now say, "Write it down." </sentence><sentence id="2311">And they would say, "Well, why didn't you tell me that before?" </sentence><sentence id="2312">You know, this story or that story. </sentence><sentence id="2313">But at the time really when they were young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. </sentence><sentence id="2314">But now they really are very interested and they want to know this and that. </sentence><sentence id="2315">So that's one reason. </sentence><sentence id="2316">| think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those of us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express themselves about that have an obligation to put it down. </sentence><sentence id="2317">It's the kind of thing that if nothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people think about how you can prevent those things. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And also, you know, this notion about some of the Holocaust deniers, here is an answer at least that this happened. </sentence><sentence id="2319">The further away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
