<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Nesse, would you, for the record, identify yourself? </sentence><sentence id="4">Give us your name, your full name, and where you were born, please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Yes, my name is Nesse Godin. </sentence><sentence id="8">I live in the <span class="region">Silver Spring area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">I was born in <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span>, <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="10">My maiden name was Galperin, Nesse Galperin. </sentence><sentence id="11">I was born in 1928. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell us about <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span>, and tell us about your family. </sentence><sentence id="18">What was it like for you growing up in <span class="populated place">Siaulai</span> as a young child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: You see, when I grew up <span class="country">Lithuania</span> was between the two wars-- First World War and Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="22">It was a democracy with a President, with a <span class="building">Cabinet</span>; and all the people really lived nicely together with a little bit of anti-Semitism, but not to be beaten up or anything. </sentence><sentence id="23">Here and there, a <span class="spatial object">Swastika</span> on the <span class="building">house</span>, on the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">But in general, Jewish people in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> lived pretty much comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="25">I had a pretty nice childhood up to the age of 13. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: That sounds good. </sentence><sentence id="32">What did your parents do? </sentence><sentence id="33">What about your brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Well, I did not have any sisters. </sentence><sentence id="38">I had two brothers older than me--one five years older, one seven years older. </sentence><sentence id="39">My parents had a <span class="building">dairy business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">My parents were, you know, what we call Balabatisha (ph) people--not wealthy rich people but comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="41">My parents were involved in the community work. </sentence><sentence id="42">Like my mother, especially; she was a person that believed that you have to be involved in helping other people. </sentence><sentence id="43">And part of the community work was to take care of the sick, of the orphans, of the widows. </sentence><sentence id="44">And that, my mother was involved with. </sentence><sentence id="45">Her name was Sarah Galperin. </sentence><sentence id="46">You had to raise money. </sentence><sentence id="47">You closed your <span class="dlf">door</span> of your own <span class="building">store</span>, and you went to your neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="48">And when someone was in need, you went and asked them to contribute to help other people. </sentence><sentence id="49">And I grew up in that background, knowing that you have to be kind and good; and I really did not understand what hatred was, or indifference. </sentence><sentence id="50">I really did not. </sentence><sentence id="51">I was raised with love in my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: Tell me about <span class="building">school</span>, for you as a girl. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Many people think that <span class="country">Europe</span> was like way back years ago, when they came, in the turn of the century. </sentence><sentence id="71">Everybody has to understand that even in <span class="country">Europe</span> progress was made. </sentence><sentence id="72">For instance, my city--30,000 people... You know, people laugh when I say "a <span class="populated place">city</span>"; but <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span> was the second largest <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">It was <span class="populated place">Vilnius</span> that was taken over--<span class="populated place">Vilna</span>--by the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="74">But in that time, <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span> was a larger <span class="populated place">city</span>, was the capital of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>; the next one was <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span>--or as we Jewish people called it, <span class="populated place">Shavli</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">And in Hebrew, we referred to it as <span class="populated place">Shavli</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">We had a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, which was called <span class="building">Gymnasium Bialik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">It was a (unclear word) type of <span class="building">school</span>, what as you started through <span class="building">kindergarten</span> through <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was a <span class="building">Beth Sefer Chevra</span> for people who could not afford as much. </sentence><sentence id="79">There was a <span class="building">Yavner</span> for very religious people who were ultra-orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="80">Even in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, although everybody was orthodox, we did not have a conservative or reform. </sentence><sentence id="81">We just had <span class="building">orthodox synagogue</span>; but we were Misnagdim, not Hasidim. </sentence><sentence id="82">What it means is, our people did not believe in the Rebbe, did not wear curlicues and the black clothing and the fur hat. </sentence><sentence id="83">Our family looked pretty much like an American family. </sentence><sentence id="84">My father did not cover his head just to go to <span class="building">shul</span> or to make a prayer. </sentence><sentence id="85">So we had the <span class="building">religious school</span> <span class="building">Yavner</span>, we had a <span class="building">Fortshuler</span> (ph) for people that were Yiddishkeit--you know, Bundistin [NB: socialists] that didn't believe in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="86">Then we had many <span class="dlf">cheders</span> where people just sent their children. </sentence><sentence id="87">They went to regular <span class="building">school</span>, to <span class="building">Lithuanian school</span>; and then they went to learn customs and prayers in a <span class="building">cheder</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: So you grew up this way. </sentence><sentence id="107">Tell us in growing up what happened then, what happened, how old were you when the Germans came and what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Also, I would like to remark [that] for a small--at this time--<span class="populated place">city</span> which is not so big, we had quite a few <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">We had all the time <span class="building">Yiddish Theater</span> come; we had a Jewish paper, newspaper; we had Maccabee, which was a sport organization. </sentence><sentence id="112">We have every type of Zionist organization from the right to the left existing in a small <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">When I grew up, as I said, I went to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>; I happened to go to the <span class="building">Gymnasia Bialik</span> from <span class="building">kindergarten</span> to the age of 12. </sentence><sentence id="114">At the age of 12, in 1940... You know, many people skipped that year. </sentence><sentence id="115">Even when I go out to speak to a <span class="building">school</span> and I'm giving just a half hour, I cannot go into detail about history. </sentence><sentence id="116">But in 1940, <span class="country">Lithuania</span> was occupied by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="117">And that's when we were not allowed to study Hebrew anymore. </sentence><sentence id="118">All the <span class="building">schools</span> had to study Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="119">At that point, the very wealthy of the <span class="populated place">community</span>--the <span class="building">Burjui</span>, as they called them--were deported to <span class="country">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">But ironically, these people lived through cold and hunger but nobody killed them. </sentence><sentence id="121">They survived, and many of them came now to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">My family, as I told you before, were <span class="populated place">Balabatish</span>--which is comfortable, but not very rich. </sentence><sentence id="123">So we were allowed to stay. </sentence><sentence id="124">And in our <span class="building">business</span>, the Communists put in like an overseer; but my parents were still running the <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">Now, 1941, we heard before that in <span class="country">Poland</span> already things are being bad for the Jews--Jews are made to leave their <span class="building">homes</span> and go away. </sentence><sentence id="126">I, as a child at the age of 12, had firsthand information about it; because in my <span class="building">home</span> came what we called Platim--runaways-- people that escaped from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">My mother's first cousin, her name was Regina Vlafsia (ph); I can't recall her husband's first name--they were children of a family by the name of Fabilisski. </sentence><sentence id="128">They were manufacturers for cloth in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of _6d_, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">They had a lot of money, and somehow they bought their way out to come to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And they came to our <span class="building">home</span>; and they told us that they were all made to leave their <span class="building">homes</span> and relocate their particular family to <span class="populated place">warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">This young couple did not know exactly what happened during that time, but we had gotten in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>--my aunt also in the <span class="country">United States</span>--some letters from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, assuming they were from <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, from this great uncle of my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="132">So we knew what was happening in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">But you don't think it will happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="134">I'm telling you the truth. </sentence><sentence id="135">You know, I make a smile with it, and I'm saying it because people don't realize that it can happen anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="136">If we don't learn from this part of history how it happened, it can happen anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="137">We lived so nice in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>--Jewish people, non- Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="138">The children played together, our parents did business together. </sentence><sentence id="139">We didn't think that our own neighbors are not going to stand by us and help us at the time of need. </sentence><sentence id="140">In 1941, the Germans occupied <span class="country">Lithuania</span> in three days. </sentence><sentence id="141">You will see documentation shows it. </sentence><sentence id="142">I was 13 years old--a little girl--but I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="143">I remember it well. </sentence><sentence id="144">My <span class="populated place">city</span>, they marched through in one night. </sentence><sentence id="145"><span class="populated place">Siauliai</span> is a <span class="populated place">city</span> that stands from the main <span class="dlf">road</span> of <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">In every war, the armies had to pass through it; because the main <span class="dlf">road</span> from <span class="country">Germany</span> to <span class="country">Russia</span> had to pass this <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">So that's why we saw the war going through. </sentence><sentence id="148">But we were not affected by this military occupation. </sentence><sentence id="149">The military went through that night; no bombs fell, no people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="150">They went on farther to fight the war. </sentence><sentence id="151">But they left behind the (unclear word) the Gestapo, the Nazi party, the special unit that were called...I don't even know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="152"><span class="building">Einsatzgruppen</span>, or whatever they were called at the time--to take care of the Jewish affairs. </sentence><sentence id="153">And their aim right away started like in any other place with different laws for Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="154">Jewish people are not allowed to have <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">Jewish children cannot go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">Jewish people are not allowed to go to buy food in the <span class="building">grocery store</span> but at certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="157">By the time we got to that <span class="building">store</span> to get the food, there was no food there. </sentence><sentence id="158">You know, they didn't have <span class="spatial object">freezers</span> or <span class="spatial object">refrigerators</span> like here. </sentence><sentence id="159">Small <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">Every day the farmer brought the food. </sentence><sentence id="161">So right away, we suffered hunger already, too. </sentence><sentence id="162">The law came out [that] Jewish    women were not allowed to be pregnant, they had to have abortions. </sentence><sentence id="163">No future for the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="164">Every Jew had to wear a Star of David in front and in back of the garment. </sentence><sentence id="165">Many people say to me, "Why did you have to wear it?" </sentence><sentence id="166">Two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="167">One, a symbol of shame. </sentence><sentence id="168">But the most important: why did they want us to wear it? </sentence><sentence id="169">An ID. </sentence><sentence id="170">They wanted to make sure they know exactly where the Jew is. </sentence><sentence id="171">The punishment for not wearing this... Specific[ally], we called it the "yellow letter." </sentence><sentence id="172">We didn't even call it a <span class="env feature">star</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was a Star of David; but the "patch of yellow," that's what we called it in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">We didn't say <span class="building">Magen David</span>, or yellow <span class="building">Magen David</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">The "yellow letter," we called it. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was a "yellow letter," we called it; it was a patch that was the ID. </sentence><sentence id="177">If you didn't wear it, the punishment was death. </sentence><sentence id="178">Now, you think about it. </sentence><sentence id="179">Children many times say, "Why did you have to put it on? </sentence><sentence id="180">You could go around the <span class="populated place">city</span>; they would think you are Christian." </sentence><sentence id="181">But unfortunately, not too many friends around us. </sentence><sentence id="182">The same people that were our neighbors deceived us, reported on us, showed where a Jew was. </sentence><sentence id="183">If you didn't put on, they would say, "This is a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="184">They killed you for not wearing that patch, that star. </sentence><sentence id="185">The next process was, they started to grab Jewish men off the <span class="building">homes</span>, out of the <span class="building">homes</span>, out of the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Allegedly, they have to clean the <span class="populated place">city</span> of war damage. </sentence><sentence id="187">The Rabbis, the scholars--a thousand men were put into the <span class="building">city jails</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">We had two <span class="building">jails</span>; a <span class="building">white jail</span> and a <span class="building">red jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">That's how it was called. </sentence><sentence id="190">The red Deturmen and the white <span class="spatial object">Deturmen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">Because one was painted white, the other was red bricks. </sentence><sentence id="192">They put them into those <span class="building">jails</span>, the most terrible Lithuanian sadists taking care of them. </sentence><sentence id="193">Who were they?The same policemen of the <span class="populated place">home town</span> that walked around. </sentence><sentence id="194">We didn't have even traffic. </sentence><sentence id="195">They just walked around to make sure everything is in order. </sentence><sentence id="196">They joined the evil cause. </sentence><sentence id="197">They put on arm bands, they helped to get rid of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="198">They had 1,000 men in that <span class="building">jail</span>, with promises they are going to take them to labor. </sentence><sentence id="199">And we believed it. </sentence><sentence id="200">You don't think you don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="201">You believe it. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, some people ran and they tried to get people out of that <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">But nobody succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="204">These thousand men were taken out to a <span class="env feature">forest</span> near    our <span class="populated place">city</span> by the name of <span class="populated place">Kuzhi</span>, where they were made to dig their own <span class="dlf">graves</span>, they were made to get undressed naked, they were shot and they were covered with <span class="env feature">earth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">How did we know exactly what happened there? </sentence><sentence id="206">The farmers in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">They came back to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and told us exactly. </sentence><sentence id="208">I, as a child, remember those farmers that used to bring milk to our <span class="building">grocery store</span>, to our <span class="building">dairy store</span>, doing like this (motioning), telling the <span class="env feature">earth</span> shook over the so-called <span class="dlf">graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">Why did it shake? </sentence><sentence id="210">Many, many people fell into that <span class="dlf">hole</span> and were not even shot to death. </sentence><sentence id="211">They covered them with <span class="env feature">earth</span>, and they suffocated. </sentence><sentence id="212">There are many incidents. </sentence><sentence id="213">I know a young man who lives in <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span> who ran away from a small <span class="populated place">city</span> by the name of Aniksht. </sentence><sentence id="214">In this particular place, the Germans and the Lithuanians were so drunk that they didn't cover the <span class="dlf">hole</span> that night. </sentence><sentence id="215">The only time when people tell you they run away from those <span class="dlf">holes</span> was if you were injured and they didn't cover the <span class="dlf">hole</span> that night -- they were too tired or didn't want to bother -- then they had a chance to escape. </sentence><sentence id="216">And also, many times, when I talk about escaping you have to understand to escape you need a place to escape to. </sentence><sentence id="217">Everybody wanted to escape. </sentence><sentence id="218">But if your neighbor doesn't let you in, or if you try to run to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and while you are running somebody points a finger--"Here is a Jew"--and you are killed. </sentence><sentence id="219">So you wonder does it pay to escape, or maybe I should wait in the <span class="populated place">community</span> for a week, a month. </sentence><sentence id="220">The war will end, and I will live. </sentence><sentence id="221">So after we heard what happened to this thousand men, we knew the Holocaust was happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="222">This is when in my <span class="populated place">city</span> our own <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span>, marvelous leaders, marvelous men. </sentence><sentence id="223">And as I told you before, my mother was connected. </sentence><sentence id="224">Because she was on this committee of helping the poor and the widows, and so she knew firsthand from the leaders what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="225">They decided to go to the Christian clergy to beg them to help to save our <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">Those Priests, Roman Catholic, they were marvelous men; but when our <span class="building">community council</span> came to beg them to save our people they said "We are afraid to get involved. </sentence><sentence id="227">We will help you. </sentence><sentence id="228">By helping you, they will kill us." </sentence><sentence id="229">Can you imagine, human beings were afraid to help other human beings? </sentence><sentence id="230">You know, many times we hear all these beautiful statements made by Pastor Niemdller, and other statements, how sorry they are. </sentence><sentence id="231">Yes, you are sorry. </sentence><sentence id="232">But isn't it easier to be there for other human beings when they need you, than after the fact to say you are sorry? </sentence><sentence id="233">Now at that point -- I know if I could sit with you, Linda, and talk with you for weeks of what went through in this short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="234">Because they said they are going to transfer all the Jews of our <span class="populated place">city</span> to a little <span class="populated place">city</span> by the name of <span class="populated place">Jagga</span> (ph), <span class="populated place">Jagerod</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="235">They said, you know, there we will be able to stay and we will be able to live there. </sentence><sentence id="236">But our Council felt if they are going to move us from our <span class="populated place">home town</span>...we are not going to move us from our <span class="populated place">home town</span>, we are not going to be in such good shape. </sentence><sentence id="237">We will be better off if we can stay in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">At that point, you know, there were different rumors. </sentence><sentence id="239">Some people said that our <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span> persuaded some Lithuanians to help us to convince that we could be in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">I heard from my mother that she said and I saw that we gave gold and silver and diamonds to give actually to the (unclear word)_ and the Gestapo to bribe them so we could stay in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, they wouldn't take us away right away. </sentence><sentence id="241">We will make shoes and boots for the army. </sentence><sentence id="242">We had many shoe and <span class="building">leather factories</span>, <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span> was famous for it. </sentence><sentence id="243">People that know about that <span class="region">area</span>, Lithuanian was famous about beef and cattle, so we had a lot of leather. </sentence><sentence id="244">So I don't know exactly what was the persuasion, the good people that intervened with the money, maybe everything together, that they decided yes, they are not going to take us to <span class="populated place">Jagga</span>, <span class="populated place">Jaggerod</span> (ph), they are going to let us stay in the <span class="populated place">city</span> but not in our <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">A <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed. </sentence><sentence id="246">At the beginning was formed two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">Many times when I go out to talk I don't go into detail because a half hour, today we have time. </sentence><sentence id="248">There was two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, one <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on one side was across from the <span class="building">factory</span> of <span class="building">Frenklfabrik</span>, a <span class="building">leather factory</span>," was called the <span class="populated place">Kaukazas ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">Then, on the other side near the red <span class="building">jail</span>, was the " After Chaim Frenkl. </sentence><sentence id="250">Founded by him in 1879. </sentence><sentence id="251"><span class="populated place">Trakai ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> in our <span class="populated place">city</span>--four square blocks each, or five; small <span class="region">area</span>--and that's where the Jews were supposed to relocate. </sentence><sentence id="253">Now, you couldn't take your <span class="spatial object">bundles</span> and move into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was a special commission that came to every <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">The commission consisted of Germans and Lithuanians, because the Lithuanians showed them where is the <span class="building">Jewish home</span> and the little secretaries. </sentence><sentence id="256">Now, I will share with you what happened in my <span class="building">house</span>--firsthand information. </sentence><sentence id="257">My two brothers--one older five years than me, one seven years older than me--so one was 18, one was 20. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was 13. </sentence><sentence id="259">And my parents, my mother was at that point 43 and my father was maybe 45...yes, 45. </sentence><sentence id="260">And they came with commission, they looked around our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>; and they told my parents how many <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, how many <span class="spatial object">pillows</span>, how many clothing we can take to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and how many people. </sentence><sentence id="261">They issued four certificates. </sentence><sentence id="262">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was originally for people to work--not for children, not for sick, not for elderly. </sentence><sentence id="263">I was 13. </sentence><sentence id="264">They didn't need me. </sentence><sentence id="265">I remember it very well, how I felt when I saw I was going to be separated from my family at that point. </sentence><sentence id="266">My mother succeeded to bribe the Lithuanian Secretary. </sentence><sentence id="267">How did it happen? </sentence><sentence id="268">As a child, I had a ceramic cat where I used to save my money that I got for Chanukah, for my birthday--silver money. </sentence><sentence id="269">And my mother said to the secretary, quietly, "This is full of silver money. </sentence><sentence id="270">If you will ask for it and I will have to give it to you, please leave a blank certificate--the fifth one--on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>." </sentence><sentence id="271">And as they were walking out, this commission...the Secretary said, "I want this little cat.". </sentence><sentence id="272">My mother said, "That's my little girl's. </sentence><sentence id="273">She loves it." </sentence><sentence id="274">The German said "Give it to her." </sentence><sentence id="275">You understand, how she could bribe -- it's important to know this little fact -- and he walked out with a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="276">But I remember my mother counting those certificates. </sentence><sentence id="277">Four were there with names filled in; a fifth blank certificate. </sentence><sentence id="278">My parents filled it in. </sentence><sentence id="279">Now, to go into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> you just had to show the certificate. </sentence><sentence id="280">If you had the certificate, they let you in through the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">So about 5,000 people got into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">We had 10,000 Jewish people in the two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">The people that did not get this yellow certificate, I believe it's about 3,500. </sentence><sentence id="284">The <span class="building">orphanage</span>, the elderly, the sick, the children from many families, and many, many people that came to their <span class="building">home</span> last and there was no more <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>--they were put into the <span class="building">city synagogues</span>, in the <span class="building">shulen</span>, as we called it, within the <span class="building">shul</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">With hunger, no <span class="env feature">water</span>; they were begging for food, they were begging for them to be saved. </sentence><sentence id="286">People were trying -- our <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span>, who were wonderful people, they tried so hard to save. </sentence><sentence id="287">They were saying already, "Okay, take them to this little <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Jagga</span>.". </sentence><sentence id="288">They thought at least they will live; because we had already the 1,000 men experience. </sentence><sentence id="289">These people were killed just like the thousand men in another <span class="env feature">forest</span>, 3,500 of them. </sentence><sentence id="290">So by the time the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed, I don't know exactly whether it was August or September, I don't remember; but I know [by the] High Holidays, we were already--my family--in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">Half of our population was killed. </sentence><sentence id="292">So, that's how the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed in our <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">You know, feel free to interject or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="294">Now, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>... I will tell you how it was when I was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">All the working people went to work in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="296">Girls like me--at the age of 13, you see, I had a certificate to go in. </sentence><sentence id="297">But I wasn't on the master list, you understand? </sentence><sentence id="298">The same way, I was smuggled in. </sentence><sentence id="299">People succeeded to smuggle in some sick, some elderly, some children even younger than me. </sentence><sentence id="300">But you were not on the master list, master list or whatever, you didn't get food. </sentence><sentence id="301">You didn't get the rations. </sentence><sentence id="302">So your family shared with you. </sentence><sentence id="303">Let's say we got X amount of bread, or... don't remember how much it was at that time. </sentence><sentence id="304">Five people ate of the ration of four; and some people, four people ate of the ration of two. </sentence><sentence id="305">So this is... People have to understand that even as little as the ration was, if you were lucky enough to have your child or your elderly with you at that point, they didn't get food. </sentence><sentence id="306">Your ration of food became smaller. </sentence><sentence id="307">In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, girls like me had to take care of little children. </sentence><sentence id="308">Many families right away tried to make some little hiding place, whether it was a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> or in a <span class="dlf">wall</span>; because we saw that things look bad. </sentence><sentence id="309">In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, selection upon selection, they came for no reason whatever to take people because they heard the rumor there are    children in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there are sick in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">How did they get in? </sentence><sentence id="311">We don't want to feed them. </sentence><sentence id="312">So they came to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="313">I lived through two years in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> like this. </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know how I survived. </sentence><sentence id="315">How I have hidden. </sentence><sentence id="316">One time I remember -- the Jewish police in my <span class="populated place">city</span> were wonderful, they ran through and warned us that the SS is coming to take people so quickly hide, do whatever. </sentence><sentence id="317">So I was supposed to get out my <span class="dlf">door</span> and go into the little <span class="building">shed</span> where you keep wood, that's where my hiding place was. </sentence><sentence id="318">As I was pulling the <span class="dlf">door</span> to open up I felt pressure on the <span class="dlf">door</span> from the other side and I remember not breathing but I could hear my heart pound and the German opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>, the SS man, and he looked in and he said to his friend or whatever, his associate, "This <span class="interior space">room</span> is empty." </sentence><sentence id="319">And he closed the <span class="dlf">door</span> behind him. </sentence><sentence id="320">I tell you many incidents like this that I was saved at that time, really by the grace of God. </sentence><sentence id="321">Two years like this. </sentence><sentence id="322">When I was 15, I was allowed to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">Now, there were many ways of people being put on a list. </sentence><sentence id="324">Let's say they took a selection of people, they took -- sometime they didn't even know how many they took -- they took 120, and the list was 100. </sentence><sentence id="325">20 people, kids that got a little older or the sick that got a little healthier could go out to <span class="building">work</span> instead. </sentence><sentence id="326">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work instead. </sentence><sentence id="327">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work. </sentence><sentence id="328">At that time, in 1943, they did not need two <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">We were living already spacey so many people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="330">They combined both <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> together, just the one on <span class="populated place">Trakai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">The <span class="populated place">Kaukazas ghetto</span> was closed completely. </sentence><sentence id="332">We were transferred to the other <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">A little bit people, there were too many of them, they took out some men and women. </sentence><sentence id="334">And we thought they were going to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="335">But no, they took them to a small place--I really don't remember the name--to work, to make <span class="env feature">turf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">I don't know what <span class="env feature">turf</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="337">It is a material that comes from the <span class="env feature">earth</span>, and you press it for burn purposes, for heating purposes. </sentence><sentence id="338">I don't really know what you call that composite of <span class="env feature">earth</span> and <span class="env feature">weeds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">We used it a lot for heating purposes. </sentence><sentence id="340">So they took them there. </sentence><sentence id="341">We came in 1943 into the other <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">We were nine people in one <span class="interior space">room</span>: two uncles and aunts and our family [of] five. </sentence><sentence id="343">We    were still together, that many of the family. </sentence><sentence id="344">And I recall that time, many times to my friends, I would say, "I remember it as a better time." </sentence><sentence id="345">And they say, "Why was it a better time?" </sentence><sentence id="346">And I said, "I still was surrounded with my family, which was pretty lot. </sentence><sentence id="347">Many uncles, many aunts, many cousins, grandparents, were dead at that time--that lived in <span class="populated place">villages</span> around our <span class="region">area</span>, and in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">But my immediate family was still there." </sentence><sentence id="349">I tell you, really, I'm sitting here and trying to think of certain things to share with you. </sentence><sentence id="350">I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">A man was hung because he was caught at the <span class="dlf">gate</span> with some bread and a few eggs. </sentence><sentence id="352">Somebody said he had a few cigarettes on him, somebody said he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="353">But documented incident, because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people, too. </sentence><sentence id="354">I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> for your family. </sentence><sentence id="355">But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food. </sentence><sentence id="356">Many guards were bribed. </sentence><sentence id="357">Many, many guards, you know especially Lithuanian guards, you would bribe them with a fur coat or whatever so if nobody was around they looked the other way and let you bring in that food, so we had a little more food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="358">But if let's say German Commission or another guard came that wasn't bribed, they came quickly and they grabbed the people, they beat them terrible. </sentence><sentence id="359">But that one incident this man's name was Mussevitsky, Batsalom Mussevitsky, he was a young man, he had a wife and a child in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">He was caught with that few eggs or half a loaf of bread but very little, maybe he had a few cigarettes, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="361">He was taken to the <span class="building">Gestapo jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">The <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span> was called and they were told they are holding a big criminal, the Jews have to learn a lesson, no food is in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">The following Sunday a <span class="spatial object">gallow</span> was to be built in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">What was a <span class="spatial object">gallow</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence><sentence id="365">A <span class="spatial object">table</span>, some stick hammered to the <span class="spatial object">table</span> going this way like an L, upside-down L, a cord    hanging there. </sentence><sentence id="366">Two men sitting there, they were supposed to be the henchmen, Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="367">How they were picked, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="368">They ordered that we have to provide these henchmen. </sentence><sentence id="369">We all had to gather in this place and I remember very well a dozen SS men with guns outstretched like this went in with this one criminal that wanted to bring a little food for his child, you know. </sentence><sentence id="370">People say why didn't he run away, many times people say why didn't he run away. </sentence><sentence id="371">I said three hijackers hijack a <span class="spatial object">plane</span> or a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> with hundreds of people, three guns against hundreds of people and they are in control. </sentence><sentence id="372">Imagine dozens of guns in control of one prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="373">Well, this man was marched in like this. </sentence><sentence id="374">He walked over to the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">He said to the two men "Thou shalt not kill," you know in Yiddish, "I will do it myself." </sentence><sentence id="376">He hopped on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, on the <span class="spatial object">chair</span>, they did not even have a chance like you know in some places they tie their hands back or they put a cover on their face. </sentence><sentence id="377">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="378">He hopped, he put a string of his own, the loop you know over his, the noose, whatever it's called, over his neck, and to the assassin, the Gestapo, he said you are not going to win a war by killing me" and somebody pushed or he pushed a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this. </sentence><sentence id="379">I remember it so. </sentence><sentence id="380"><span class="populated place">Linda</span>, it was terrible times. </sentence><sentence id="381">You know, I always try to control myself, not to be too emotional because otherwise if I get too emotional, I cannot bring the message. </sentence><sentence id="382">You know, you know, this what people have to think about. </sentence><sentence id="383">I say over, I say this man resisted the Germans, I always say there is a spiritual resistance. </sentence><sentence id="384">If you didn't fight back, if you didn't punch it or whatever, I say we live the extra day we resisted them. </sentence><sentence id="385">They wanted us dead. </sentence><sentence id="386">In the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> there was sign, "Yiden"--Jews--"Don't despair. </sentence><sentence id="387">Live an extra day. </sentence><sentence id="388">We will overcome it." </sentence><sentence id="389">The hope we gave each other all through, that's all I remember as a child saying (unclear phrase), in spite of the enemy, we will overcome it, we will live, we will be free. </sentence><sentence id="390">So you can imagine this punishment. </sentence><sentence id="391">Now go back to 1943 where I was before. </sentence><sentence id="392">When we got into that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> when they condensed the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, we got a little more food. </sentence><sentence id="393">Things looked kind of better. </sentence><sentence id="394">Everybody thought, said gee, they start to treat us a little better. </sentence><sentence id="395">I was    working at that time in the <span class="building">war hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">My job was to put wood into <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> so the German soldiers would keep warm. </sentence><sentence id="397">You know we had a job, we had to do our job. </sentence><sentence id="398">That morning when I came to my commander to go to work -- it was exactly November 5, 1942, when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the <span class="spatial object">ghetto trucks</span>, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> covered with canvas, we were told we cannot go to work. </sentence><sentence id="399">I remember running back to my <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="400">My mother put two dresses on me one dress on top of another. </sentence><sentence id="401">You see people said maybe they don't let you take along a <span class="spatial object">bundle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">To be safe, a little bread in the <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>, a coin in the <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>, we were prepared to be deported. </sentence><sentence id="403">A half hour or whatever, I don't remember exactly, maybe 20 minutes, it was a short time, the Jewish police were running through the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> saying a mistake was made in the order, all the working people should leave the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="404">Chaos. </sentence><sentence id="405">People did not know what's better. </sentence><sentence id="406">Some people said it's better to hide in that <span class="populated place">Malina</span>, in the hiding place -- <span class="populated place">Malina</span> was called the hiding place during those times, a <span class="populated place">Malina</span> -- some people said it's better to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="407">The Jewish police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that were Jewish police in my <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">You won't hear not one had word about the leadership and the Jewish police in <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span> after a certain point because after a certain point them to cover other people that the Germans appointed, they brought them from the outside, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="409">But as long as we had our own people from our <span class="populated place">home town</span> it was good. </sentence><sentence id="410">So they said it's better to go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="411">I remember leaving that day for work but all day long we wondered. </sentence><sentence id="412">What were the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> doing near the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">At one point in that <span class="building">hospital</span> we worked with a german, he was from a building commander that was called Ortek (ph) and he was a civilian and he was pretty nice man, he gave us sometime a little bread but he had nothing to do with the security or taking care of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="414">His job was <span class="building">building</span> whatever. </sentence><sentence id="415">So we asked this man to go near the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and see what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="416">When he came back he said nothing happened but we saw he was pale, we saw he was bothered. </sentence><sentence id="417">But he said nothing, there was nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="418">That evening when we were    coming back from work, <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and blocks away from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Linda</span>, we heard cries, such cries I hope nobody will hear. </sentence><sentence id="419">What happened in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span>, <span class="country">Lithuania</span> on November 5, 1943, SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians, Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people, it was terrible time -- they went into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they found every hiding place, they went in, they broke every dish, every <span class="spatial object">pillow</span>, made every single person come to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> near that place where you gathered for work, all the children, all the elderly, all the sick, all the babies that were born illegally in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="420">You see, they told us we were not allowed to be pregnant but women got pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="421">They stayed in their little <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="422">If they were caught in the selection, then they were caught, but if they were not caught they had their baby in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">But on that day not one child was spared. </sentence><sentence id="424">At the <span class="dlf">gate</span> a selection to the right and to the left, a thousand children. </sentence><sentence id="425">Five hundred elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong, including two men from our <span class="building">Jewish Community Council</span> because these two men said to them "Where are you taking these children?" </sentence><sentence id="426">They said "To a better <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you are welcome to come and check it out" and they put them on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="427">We did not know then where they were taken to. </sentence><sentence id="428">We honestly believed that they were taken to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> where they have children. </sentence><sentence id="429">They said these children need supervision, you all go to <span class="building">work</span>, we will take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="430">After the war we found out they were taken to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> where they were gassed and cremated, they did not even keep them there one day. </sentence><sentence id="431">The Rabbis told me that I have to keep Yarzeit on that day that my father was taken. </sentence><sentence id="432">My father was taken with that <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">My father was 47 years old. </sentence><sentence id="434">He was among the nice Healthy, strong, tall people. </sentence><sentence id="435">Can you imagine how I feel even sharing with you? </sentence><sentence id="436">You know, Linda, I am talking about <span class="populated place">Siauliai</span>, <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="437">I am giving you just my own but by now, 1989, we know what happened all over <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">The life in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> after the children selection was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="439">No laughter, no crying. </sentence><sentence id="440">My mother used to say to me, "<span class="populated place">Nessele</span>, don't    go outside after you come from work. </sentence><sentence id="441">The neighbor lost a child one year younger than you. </sentence><sentence id="442">She will hurt." </sentence><sentence id="443">Can you imagine -- you know European people had a lot of children -- can you imagine in one day from a mother six children, eight children, you came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="444">We were a lucky family, just my father was taken. </sentence><sentence id="445">Can you me saying a lucky family after they killed my father but we were a lucky family because on that day every family lost dear ones. </sentence><sentence id="446">Not just one, two, four, six, eight people of a family went on that terrible day. </sentence><sentence id="447">So the life was terrible after that, it was just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="448">They were trying -- I don't remember exactly details -- they were trying, I mean the Germans, the SS, the Gestapo, make some <span class="populated place">internment camps</span> where they thought the workers could work separately. </sentence><sentence id="449">They thought they would get rid of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> completely. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then they thought they still need some people that should stay. </sentence><sentence id="451">There was a <span class="building">factory</span> that was making the shoes, a <span class="building">factory</span> that was making some brushes. </sentence><sentence id="452">So they left some people in those <span class="building">workshops</span> for a little bit longer but us in June of 1944, they took us to a <span class="building">railroad station</span> for deportation to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="453">We had to walk about 10 kilometers to this specific <span class="dlf">railroad</span> because in our <span class="populated place">city</span> bombs fell already. </sentence><sentence id="454">The last few days that we were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> Russian bombs fell in our <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Siaulai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="456">So we were taken to this <span class="dlf">railroad</span> by foot, we had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="457">I remember that walk very well because my mother at that time had an injury in her leg and she walked on the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> and she had injured her knees and she couldn't walk to well and they said whoever cannot walk, whoever is sick or weak should stay and some <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> will bring them to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, and my mother, like a <span class="dlf">pool</span>, stood in that group saying -- they couldn't see the injury, it was so tight, it was covered -- she said "I cannot walk, I would like to go on this <span class="spatial object">truck</span>" and a German said to her, "What do you think, run, you are still young, go to <span class="building">work</span>," you know he saved her life because we never saw the rest of the people that were on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">We were told after the    war that they were put into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in one of the <span class="building">buildings</span> and you know like in every <span class="populated place">city</span>, they dynamited the <span class="region">area</span>, dynamited them. </sentence><sentence id="459">Us, they put into <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> for a journey to <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> by the name of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">I'm going to tell you exactly about the ride. </sentence><sentence id="461">We were in there -- they didn't count you know. </sentence><sentence id="462">As we came to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, it said capacity, how many cows or horses you can have in that <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but they didn't say capacity, how many people. </sentence><sentence id="463">They shoved you in like pushed you and pushed you. </sentence><sentence id="464">They said stoop down, they didn't say stretch out, you know like this and with your knees just up and you try to take a little bit more <span class="interior space">room</span> and people say "Let me in, if I stay outside they will shoot me." </sentence><sentence id="465">So people really squeezed in to let other people in. </sentence><sentence id="466">It was so crowded. </sentence><sentence id="467">I remember having my feet over my mother, my brother on top to stretch out. </sentence><sentence id="468">A <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> in the <span class="building">comer</span> for sanitation purposes. </sentence><sentence id="469">We each have a little <span class="spatial object">package</span>. </sentence><sentence id="470">They said take along your valuables and a little food that you had still in your <span class="interior space">ghetto room</span> and some water. </sentence><sentence id="471">In my <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> we had plenty water because we were on the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span> where there were <span class="dlf">wells</span> so we had no problem with water. </sentence><sentence id="472">In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, the only good part that was in our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Siaulai</span> we could keep clean because there was plenty of water and we had enough water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="473">So as we went to those <span class="building">railroad station</span>, you know nobody had thermoses like here, you had an open dish or some dish you used to go to the <span class="building">store</span> to buy some milk in a little <span class="spatial object">container</span> that you filled with water and you took. </sentence><sentence id="474">Let's say you were a family -- we were, thank God, four of a family still alive, my two brothers, my mother and myself, but in that <span class="dlf">railroad</span> was just one brother, my mother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="475">As we were getting on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> we saw my brother said to us, "Don't get excited, your brother is not dead, he escaped." </sentence><sentence id="476">He told my mother that some nice Lithuanian man that we knew said to him, "If you have opportunity somehow to escape, do so, and don't come to my <span class="building">house</span>, come in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, there is a <span class="building">smokehouse</span> and go into that <span class="building">smokehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="477">Every night I will put out some food for you and you go let's say 10 feet or 15 feet and get that food but if they catch you, you snuck in, don't tell them I let you in." </sentence><sentence id="478">How    my brother had this opportunity to escape we did not know for many years but afterwards we found our that as we were being taken from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, instead of going out to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, he went back into the <span class="building">factory</span> where he worked and since it was a Saturday he crawled in one of the <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> and on Sunday when the <span class="building">factory</span> was closed, that's when he got out. </sentence><sentence id="479">But we did not know at that point, just he told my mother. </sentence><sentence id="480">He didn't want even me to know or my brother to know that he has this opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="481">Look, in that <span class="spatial object">train</span>, in that thing we were three already of the family, we were left three, and it was just the most terrible thing that happened. </sentence><sentence id="482">You cannot imagine. </sentence><sentence id="483">Everybody is really looking out for themselves because you want to stretch your foot out, your foot falls asleep. </sentence><sentence id="484">You try to put it on somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="485">The person doesn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="486">You know their foot is asleep too. </sentence><sentence id="487">Some People were kind and said okay, put your foot and you told them put your feet. </sentence><sentence id="488">Some were not. </sentence><sentence id="489">It was a terrible journey. </sentence><sentence id="490">We traveled three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="491">The few survivors of my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, when I see them and I ask them, "Do you remember how many days we traveled?" </sentence><sentence id="492">They say no, three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="493">And this is why many times I tell you the I say the truth. </sentence><sentence id="494">By the time we arrived to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, we were a mess, we were dirty, we couldn't reach that <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> to make. </sentence><sentence id="495">Many people had to make under and even if you could hold it until you went to the <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>, the person next to you, if they made, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> moved, it moves. </sentence><sentence id="496">The stench was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="497">Some people told me in some of those <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> people suffocated. </sentence><sentence id="498">I did not see so I don't share it with you. </sentence><sentence id="499">I remember when they opened those <span class="dlf">doors</span> we thought it was heaven but we came to hell, we came to <span class="populated

over 200 killing places. </sentence><sentence id="505"><span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, many people lost    their life. </sentence><sentence id="506">As soon as we arrived, divided, men this way, women that way. </sentence><sentence id="507">Our packages, the little bundles taken away. </sentence><sentence id="508">I remember my mother saying to me -- I wore a watch at that time -- she said "My kind, my child, take off the watch and put it in the <span class="env feature">sand</span> so the Germans wouldn't have it." </sentence><sentence id="509">The little we knew that the next day they go with a <span class="spatial object">plow</span> and they take out all the gold. </sentence><sentence id="510">So everybody like whispered, take off your jewelry and stick it in the <span

go here to me and my mother, because she was 46 and I was 16. </sentence><sentence id="512">She was considered old. </sentence><sentence id="513">I didn't see her for a long time. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: Yes, we came out from the <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="992">Also don't forget we didn't get a <span class="spatial object">towel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="993">Sometimes people think you got into a <span class="interior space">shower</span>, you got a <span class="spatial object">towel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="994">We were standing there and shivering and it was cold and they pushed us with the guns you know. </sentence><sentence id="995">It wasn't just walking slowly or whatever, you constantly had to run. </sentence><sentence id="996">You know they didn't say walk, you ran from one place to the other. </sentence><sentence id="997">Run, run, run. </sentence><sentence id="998">I remember the <span class="env feature">water</span> was dripping and you walked into that other <span class="interior space">room</span> and there were like in a <span class="spatial object">gynecologist tables</span> like this and everybody had to hop on this <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="999">And can you imagine, I was 16, I never had an examination, internal examination, I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So they checked you. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I don't even think that people were doctors it looked. </sentence><sentence id="1002">What were they looking for? </sentence><sentence id="1003">Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1004">They were looking for a diamond, a piece of gold, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1005">Some people hid it there. </sentence><sentence id="1006">You know many people thought they will need a piece of gold, they will swallow it and a few days later they had it. </sentence><sentence id="1007">You know many times you may wonder when somebody says I had a gold coin with me and the people don't really would like to tell you exactly how they brought it. </sentence><sentence id="1008">But many people did it that way. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> you came, they gave you this medical examination, opened your mouth, they looked in your <span class="interior space">rectum</span>, they looked in your front to make sure you don't have -- in the mouth if you had gold caps they didn't even (unclear word). </sentence><sentence id="1010">Some came, they took your number. </sentence><sentence id="1011">There they had a man that pulled it out. </sentence><sentence id="1012">You stood there, if they were in the mood, they pulled it out right there. </sentence><sentence id="1013">A <span class="spatial object">bucket</span> full of gold caps. </sentence><sentence id="1014">They took it from the dead, they took it from the living. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Then you went into another like outside -- this was already almost outside like with a little cover and they threw a bundle of clothing to you. </sentence><sentence id="1016">What was in a <span class="spatial object">bundle</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1017">A dress, a pair of underwear, and they gave you a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Another question. </sentence><sentence id="1019">Did they say you wear size 7 or 8 or 5 or 10? </sentence><sentence id="1020">Do you know that even in our group by some mistake we all got the shoes, our own shoes, and that was very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Somebody made a mistake somewhere because I didn't get my shoes but you know they threw to us the shoes and all of a sudden people said "Give me, those are my shoes, give me, those are my shoes" and people started to exchange until you found your shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1022">But let's say somebody -- I had a pair of boots and it was summer, nobody wanted those boots but I wanted them and I got them back so I was lucky I had these boots. </sentence><sentence id="1023">So you had a dress, a pair of underpants and a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Now the family is taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Me, 16 years old, standing there surrounded with some women from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> but alone, all alone, very different than this nine people in the <span class="interior space">ghetto room</span> surrounded with <span class="dlf">electric wires</span>, guards going around and around, you are scared, people are whispering from one side and another what's happening there. </sentence><sentence id="1026">The next thing what they do, they take us into a big <span class="interior space">room</span> to register. </sentence><sentence id="1027">You know you think they took your family, they took your clothing, one more thing, your gorgeous name. </sentence><sentence id="1028">16 years old I was prisoner 54015 in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Why was I prisoner there? </sentence><sentence id="1030">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1031">and still I'm lucky, I bring out always I'm lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1032">They didn't tattoo it on my arm, they gave it on a piece of shmata [Yidd: "rag"], on a piece of rag on my clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1033">In <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, all my friends that survived, the few of them have it on their arm. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I had in on a piece of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="1035">From there, they assigned you in <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1036">The particular <span class="building">barrack</span> I was assigned to had no <span class="spatial object">bins</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1037">The <span class="building">Stutthof</span> was being rebuilt. </sentence><sentence id="1038">When we came, at some point they had old <span class="building">barracks</span> that had <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1039">They were doing some new <span class="building">barracks</span>, a new section when I got into that side, between each <span class="populated place">camp</span> was two rows of <span class="dlf">electric wires</span>--not one, but two rows, like this, between the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span>...between the new <span class="populated place">camp</span> and the old <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And from there, across these <span class="dlf">wires</span>, I saw my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1041">So I knew she was alive. </sentence><sentence id="1042">That's when I found out she was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1043">But she was...like people that in case they don't need you no more, you are next to be killed, on that side. </sentence><sentence id="1044">In the morning, they woke us up 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1045">They called it "appell"--roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1046">When they said, "Roll call!", </sentence><sentence id="1047">you had to be outside like this (snapping fingers), and lined up in a specific <span class="dlf">row</span> behind a specific people. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And if you didn't know these people, too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1049">You had to recognize them, and be there at the right place. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Let's say, if you are in the <span class="interior space">20th row</span> in the middle, you had to find your <span class="dlf">row</span> and stand there. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Many a time I sat half of the night on the <span class="dlf">window</span> of the <span class="building">barrack</span>, when they say roll call, to jump out and be outside because they running with whips and with guns and hit us so hard, we should go out quick. </sentence><sentence id="1052">You stood there for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Why you stood there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They counted and they counted and they counted. </sentence><sentence id="1055">They wanted to make sure nobody escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1056">You couldn't escape from <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1057">You know very well very few recorded -- the only way you could escape is maybe you were sent out for a labor or you had some connection somehow, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="1058">The only people that were missing were people that died in the <span class="building">barrack</span> or somebody decided to commit suicide and jumped on the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1059">They counted and finally maybe 6:00 o'clock they said, line up, we will give you black coffee, it was some black drink -- and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The piece of bread was very tiny, I don't know, believe me you could eat it now, it's like half a sandwich, you know, just the bread. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Then you were assigned something to do. </sentence><sentence id="1062">In my particular <span class="region">area</span> in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> they said today you go clean the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, tomorrow let's say you sweep the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Every day if they needed 50 woman, 100 women to do certain chores, sweep the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1064">I will share with you one of these labors. </sentence><sentence id="1065">One day we were taken out, about 50 women, and with about a dozen SS men with the guns outstretched and we had to walk out of the sight of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and there is an empty <span class="interior space">space</span> with a pile of shoes, mountain of shoes, big shoes, little shoes, tall shoes, tall, old shoes, new shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1066">We were told to sort them. </sentence><sentence id="1067">This was a special command to sort shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1068">We had to sort them, tie them in pairs, put them in bundles, ladies" shoes separate, men's shoes separate, children's shoes separate, and we were working, and on the other side was a <span class="populated place">polish prisoner of war camp</span> and he said to us "Jewish lady, Jiduvkas (ph), you know what the shoes are? </sentence><sentence id="1069">Those are    the shoes from the people that perished, your people in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1070">Can you imagine you touch a shoe and somebody tells you the people were killed and you wonder is that your aunt's shoe, your cousin's shoe, your baby. </sentence><sentence id="1071">They become people, not shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1072">I tell you from my heart the next day when they didn't tell me to go to the shoes, I was so lucky, I was so happy to go to clean the <span class="interior space">latrines</span>, I was happier not to have to go to that job. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Can you imagine after our people were dead we had to sort shoes, we had to sort clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Many people had to drag bodies from one place to another all through those years, all through those years. </sentence><sentence id="1075">In the evening they gave us some kind of a vegetable peel soup and you had to be in the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1076">When you were in the <span class="building">barrack</span> you had an opportunity to talk to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The Germans did not go into the <span class="building">barracks</span> just like this. </sentence><sentence id="1078">The person in charge was a polish women. </sentence><sentence id="1079">In <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> mostly Polish people were in charge, they were the Kapos, nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1080">They were prisoners or criminals or whatever, they were in charge of this <span class="region">section</span> and if they came in, if they were in a good mood they didn't say nothing if you were chatting. </sentence><sentence id="1081">But otherwise you couldn't chat, you know, you had to be very careful, and that's when you found out from other people what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Let's say if I came back from that day from the shoe sorting, I could tell what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Many times people came back that sorted clothing in the clothing and they found little notes that people said we came from this and this <span class="country">country</span>, we were here, we don't know where we are being taken. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Many people from <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> were brought from <span class="country">Latvia</span>, from <span class="country">Estonia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Most of the <span class="region">baltic countries</span> came to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1086">So we knew indirect information. </sentence><sentence id="1087">In the <span class="building">barracks</span> on the <span class="dlf">walls</span> or in the <span class="building">barracks</span> that you went in, if there was a <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> you saw inscribed everywhere the word Gedenk (ph), remember. </sentence><sentence id="1088">You know, I live now with the ringing in my ears of remember. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Everybody, when we sat down the only discussion was if ever somebody survives, please tell the world what happened here. </sentence><sentence id="1090">If somebody succeeds to go in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> or be among the free world or go out for labor, please tell what happened, please tell the world what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1091">We kept on thinking that nobody knows in the    whole world what was happening to us because you know first we said "oh, we will wear the yellow star, a star, two three days, a week, a month, the war will end" but here I am talking already 1944, three years already. </sentence><sentence id="1092">By that point I was already skinny, 16 year old girl, looked horrible, I looked maybe like 40. </sentence><sentence id="1093">In <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, when I was there by myself you know with many nice Jewish women but no family, nobody, I didn't have a cousin, no one there with me, a few women from my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, a woman came over to me and said to me they don't really keep children in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1094">Why did she say that? </sentence><sentence id="1095">Every day when we were given the food, if there was a little food left tin that big bucket that they carried the food to us, the Polish Capo used to say children under 16 can get double food but under 16 were not allowed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1096">So everybody was afraid to march out. </sentence><sentence id="1097">You were hungry but I didn't say I want more food. </sentence><sentence id="1098">You didn't have a birth certificate, it's your word against theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1099">He used to come schlep me out, drag me out and another maybe dozen kids that were already 16, maybe some were, saying you can get more food, why don't you come out -- maybe some were not -- saying you can get more food, why don't you come out, you are under 16, and if I said I'm 16, he beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="1100">So this woman said to me, "it's bad, it's bad, you know, they won't keep you alive here" and I looked at her with my eyes open, you know I was so scared, and she said to me "Maidela, little girls, try to go out for labor, they do take people out for labor. </sentence><sentence id="1101">If you could get out for labor, maybe you would survive, little girl Meidela (ph), little girl," you know like this. </sentence><sentence id="1102">She didn't know my name, I never knew her name. </sentence><sentence id="1103">One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1104">I said they are given a blanket and a dish for food, it must be for work. </sentence><sentence id="1105">You know how many Jewish people went to death with a blanket and a dish for food. </sentence><sentence id="1106">So I stood in this <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1107">The woman said stand on your tip toes to look taller, pinch your cheeks to look osier, and you know I succeeded to leave <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1108">That night we left, 5,000 women. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I    remember they took us over a little <span class="env feature">river</span> -- I don't know the name of the <span class="env feature">river</span> -- by <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Somebody said that many people were drowned in that <span class="env feature">river</span> but I don't know, you know how people talk. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Maybe there is documentation on it. </sentence><sentence id="1112">I think it was the <span class="dlf">elbe</span> maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And they divided us a thousand in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, a thousand pass by, they divide it, thousand, they divide it. </sentence><sentence id="1114">So all the women from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> were divided like 10 before me so I found myself in the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> just with 10 people from my <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Other wonderful people, Jewish women, nice, but not even a friend from my <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1116">All of a sudden I found myself no family, no neighbors, no people that you know, not even a familiar face. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Now, the first <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I was in was called <span class="populated place">Malken</span> [Pol: Ma ki].* </sentence><sentence id="1118">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I worked and many people worked as I did from that period that were taken from <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>; we were put into <span class="building">canvas tents</span>, that was our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1119">We slept on <span class="env feature">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1120">The job was to dig giant <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, <span class="dlf">holes</span> for <span class="spatial object">Russian tanks</span> to fall in. </sentence><sentence id="1121">We were so weak. </sentence><sentence id="1122">The food, again, so little. </sentence><sentence id="1123">In the morning, the same procedure like in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>: Up early, they counted you, they gave you the black coffee with a little bit of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1124">In the morning -- evening a little bit of soup. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Sometime they switched it off and they didn't give nothing in the morning, they just gave the black coffee and at night you got your ration of bread and the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So imagine if you got in the evening your ration of bread and the soup, you think you are going to save your little bread for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I especially used to think I'm so hungry all day, just a little black coffee, I'm going to eat that soup, that water, and eat one bite of the bread, and the next bite I will tear off a little piece of my blanket and I wrapped it and I put it in the straw that I slept on. </sentence><sentence id="1128">In the morning my bread was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1129">And I cried, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="1130">A woman next to me said "<span class="populated place">Nessele</span>, why are you crying, <span class="populated place">Nessele</span>?" -- </sentence><sentence id="1131">She knew my name -- I said I had a little bit of bread, I put it in the straw underneath my head and a mouse must have come. </sentence><sentence id="1132">You there were 4 Subcamp of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Women only. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1137">She said "Child, give me your little bread, I will put in my <span class="spatial object">bosom</span> and I will give it to you in the morning." </sentence><sentence id="1138">You know whenever we got the bread at night and I didn't eat it, I gave it to Mrs.Feivish (ph), may she rest in peace -- that was her name -- and as she handed that piece of bread to me in the morning, she saved my life maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1139">You know, I'm telling you these things today because people don't understand how human we stayed in this inhumane situation. </sentence><sentence id="1140">I want to bring out this little things that people don't understand, people cannot understand. </sentence><sentence id="1141">As much as we survivors talk, you know we tried to tell the fact, this one killed, this one did, but I want to bring this out Linda, you know it's very important you know. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> we dug those <span class="dlf">holes</span>, we finished one <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1143">They kept on moving us, that's why we stayed in those <span class="building">canvas tents</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1144">It was convenient for them. </sentence><sentence id="1145">They had <span class="building">barracks</span> made out of veneer you know for food and also that were prefabricated that you could quickly unscrew and move on. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Like this we went into two <span class="populated place">camps</span>, <span class="populated place">Malken</span> and <span class="populated place">Derbeck</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1147">In those <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they did not have to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1148">We started to die...die of starvation and diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1149">In the morning, we got up, our hair was frozen to the <span class="env feature">ground</span> on that straw. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Many people said oh, they cut their hair in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1151">In <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, they didn't cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="1152">It was more terrible, because we didn't have water to wash with. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And when you have hair on you, it gets infested with lice; and with lice brings diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1154">By the time came October, November of 1944, it was a mess--walking skeletons with wounds. </sentence><sentence id="1155">We looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1156">At one point, at that time, they brought certain kinds of <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Not <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1158">It was like to hold horses--a round wooden thing that they put up for us to be in. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Not in the <span class="building">tents</span>, because we were doing work so they felt that we are still useful. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So they gave us this wooden <span class="building">barracks</span>; and wherever one horse had to stand was five women lying there on the straw--no <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, not a change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1161">You know, Linda, I &gt; Also a subcamp of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, for women only. </sentence><sentence id="1162">think that about six months I had not taken off my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1163">There was no reason to take it off. </sentence><sentence id="1164">There was no water to wash with, there was no change of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And then you were afraid to take it off, because maybe some person that doesn't have a dress is going to take it, or your blanket or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1166">You know people in need, you have to understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1167">We stayed there until January 1945, in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>...in those <span class="region">areas</span>, <span class="populated place">Malken</span> and <span class="populated place">Derbeck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1168">There was another place that we were moved, but I don't remember the name.deg It was three separate places. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Then one morning, we were woken up very early, maybe 3:00 o'clock at night, we were told to line up and take everything that we have in that little <span class="building">tent</span> with us. </sentence><sentence id="1170">We were leaving the <span

march. </sentence><sentence id="1173">It was called the <span class="building">Death March</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1174">You know, we marched day and night this way. </sentence><sentence id="1175">During the day we walked. </sentence><sentence id="1176">You had to stop one time, let's say you had to go the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, you had to go at that time to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Now, if you wanted to go another time to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1178">If you stopped to stay in the <span class="interior space">back</span>, you were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Whoever stayed behind was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1180">We heard all the time shots. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Also as we walked we saw many, many human beings face down with a bullet in the back in the <span class="env feature">snow</span> and we saw that they were inmates like us because they were skinny, they wore prisoner garb, we could see it was Jewish people with their stars and with their numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1182">Now, you know, we went through it was the <span class="region">Danzig area</span>--you know, exactly where <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> was, where we worked in that <span

We saw people, they say now they didn't see us. </sentence><sentence id="1183">You know, I put out...in the winter, I put out a little crumbs for the birds. </sentence><sentence id="1184">They didn't have to hand us food. </sentence><sentence id="1185">If they would just put a little crumbs or a potato peel on the <span class="dlf">street</span> where we had to walk, we wouldn't have been so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1186">They didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1187">They didn't do it, <span class="populated place">Linda</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I remember on that march -- me, I'm sharing it with you, I never share it, I will tell you that, just once I think I talked about it -- I deg Nesse identifies this place elsewhere as <span class="populated place">Praust</span>--another women's subcamp of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, located in the immediate <span class="region">area</span> of <span class="populated place">Danzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1189">remember sleeping, they told us to rest a little bit, and in the snow there was manure of a horse or a cow all dried out and straw with it and undigested grain. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I remember taking that grain, washing it in the snow, taking out the kernel and eating it. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I tell you the truth, as I look back, I think I fulfilled a big commandment to save a human life. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And I say it again, I saved my life by doing... I think sometimes I shouldn't tell about it. </sentence><sentence id="1193">It's a horrible thing to tell. </sentence><sentence id="1194">But I feel today I really want to tell you as much as I can. </sentence><sentence id="1195">On that march, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1196">They were beating us with the underside of a gun. </sentence><sentence id="1197">They didn't want to waste the bullets, they wanted to clobber us dead. </sentence><sentence id="1198">See, I have this scar on my face. </sentence><sentence id="1199">One night, we were put up in a <span class="building">barn</span> to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Sometime they put is in a <span class="building">church</span>, in a <span class="building">school</span>, in a <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1201">That night the women saw cows that had milk in the udder; and the women started to milk the cows and drink the milk in their mouths. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I didn't do it, but I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I didn't even know. </sentence><sentence id="1204">I was sleeping, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1205">All of a sudden, we heard noise: the farmer yelling, "I let you let in these dirty women in my <span class="building">barn</span>, and they are drinking the milk that I am supposed to sell tomorrow in the <span class="building">market</span>!" </sentence><sentence id="1206">Instead of saying, "I'm so happy that they can have one night a little milk." </sentence><sentence id="1207">The guard, the SS, ran into the <span class="building">barn</span> and it was stampede in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1208">They made us go out of that <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1209">They were hitting us with the underside of the <span class="spatial object">guns</span> and with <span class="spatial object">clubs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1210">And I was hit on the head on this side; and I swear to you, fire came out from my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1211">I had like a slight concussion-- I couldn't...no open wound, but I couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Two women quickly grabbed me and held me in their arms.
