<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, we, we, we really began to...because the the Utrecht students...they were before us. </sentence><sentence id="276">They, they, they, they were, uh, trying to get, uh, children from the <span class="building">Creche</span>" and as they were living in, in <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span>, it was fast. </sentence><sentence id="277">They always had to travel from <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span> to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">It's not so far, but anyway...they weren't living here, so they contacted us and they said, if, if, uh, we should collaborate..."You, you look for the children in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">You know the families," and because we didn't only have children from the <span class="building">Creche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">We had children right from the, from the parents too of course and that goes mouth by mouth. </sentence><sentence id="281">I mean someone knew that we were taking care of children and, uh, they informed the parents and we got...contacted. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was not only the <span class="building">Creche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">But they asked us and that's why, why we we started. </sentence><sentence id="284">They couldn't handle it. </sentence><sentence id="285">It was too much, and they asked us to, to uh, fetch the children from the <span class="building">Creche</span> and fetch other children. </sentence><sentence id="286">So, sometimes we hided the children ourselves or we gave them to <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span> organization--independent who, who had places, but in...let's say a year later we were completely independent and they had their own organization. </sentence><sentence id="287">We worked together but we, we looked for hiding place ourselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: So you were immediately thrown into this work when you joined the group? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: You said that the group separated. </sentence><sentence id="306">About how many people did you work with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Uh, there were only two men, my partner and I, and all the others one were girls, and that was logical because, uh, we couldn't travel with children at our age. </sentence><sentence id="310">We were about twenty. </sentence><sentence id="311">And at that age, it was very suspicious to sit in a <span class="spatial object">train</span> with a child. </sentence><sentence id="312">I mean...of course as a Jew it was very dangerous, but in that, that period, all men about twenty years of age were very afraid to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span> because the, the Groen Politie," the German police, trapped all the  time all kinds of young boys from my age and took them, and sent them to <span class="country">Germany</span> for work, so it was already dangerous just to sit into a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">So that was one of the reasons why we had...the girls, they were never picked up. </sentence><sentence id="314">I mean they, they left the girls alone. </sentence><sentence id="315">So all the, all the transport of the children had to be done by, by the girls. </sentence><sentence id="316">Sometimes I went with them to get them, but that's, that's different. </sentence><sentence id="317">Then they were there and it was their child and what we...my partner and I did...we were looking...we went to <span class="populated place">Friesland</span>, to the <span class="region">north</span>, and looking for contacts, and to look for hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="318">We went to the <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">We were organizers, you see, but the actual <span class="spatial object">transport</span> was done by the, by the girls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Were these all Christians, or was it a mix of Jews and Christians working together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: There were no Jews. </sentence><sentence id="334">There's only one Jewish, uh, couple with whom I worked and they were looking...it was...it was really...the the the woman is still alive, and and they really were looking so Jewish and they worked all the time. </sentence><sentence id="335">They, they...I never understood. </sentence><sentence id="336">They, they walked around the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">They were many times picked up. </sentence><sentence id="338">They had very good papers. </sentence><sentence id="339">And that was the only Jewish couple which I knew which was, uh, working. </sentence><sentence id="340">Uh, that's of course the people from the <span class="building">Creche</span>, from the <span class="building">Joodse Raad</span>,deg and from the <span class="building">Schouwburg</span>,". </sentence><sentence id="341">That I don't mean...I mean in our group, there couldn't be any Jews because it was too dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="342">It would be too dangerous.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: You were able to travel freely by yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: Can you tell me about the narrow escapes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Well, the narrowest escape I had was, uh, we had a contact in the head of the, the <span class="interior space">underground</span> in <span class="populated place">Friesland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">He was the big boss in <span class="populated place">Friesland</span>, and I...he was...he was a very good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="465">My, my son is still called, is named after him, and he, uh...suddenly there was a very, uh, uh, someone was caught and he was, he was talking, and he knew too much. </sentence><sentence id="466">So the whole group in <span class="populated place">Friesland</span> had to, to hide and had to change addresses and go out of <span class="populated place">Friesland</span> because at first in fact, he knew everything, the man, and he, he betrayed the whole thing, so, so he went to, to <span class="populated place">Amersfoort</span>, which is near <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span>, and he let me know that he was there and he asked me to come. </sentence><sentence id="467">And I had an appointment with him in <span class="populated place">Amersfoort</span>,  0 on the <span class="dlf">street</span> not in a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">And he said, "Well, would you, I, I need a new persoonbewijs, identity card." </sentence><sentence id="469">And he gave me his photo and he said, "Uh, please take care of it, and give me a very good one." </sentence><sentence id="470">And of course we had our contacts in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, people who were printing...who had original identity cards, but only for the top people in the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="471">So I went there and I, I made his, uh...I got his new identity card, and I had, uh, a rendezvous with him at six o'clock on a certain day in, uh, in <span class="populated place">Amersfoort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">Only, only on a address, but I was very, uh, upset about it because it was so...he was...he was the most man the Germans looked for in the whole <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">So I had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="474">And I asked the girls whom I lived with at the time, "Go with me and and take the identity card, because if I'm caught with that"...I could have been caught just as, as a twenty-year old boy. </sentence><sentence id="475">That had nothing to do with my...and then I would have...then there would have been the possibility that the identity card would be lost and I would be sent to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> or something, but that was not the question. </sentence><sentence id="476">The question was I wanted him to have that identity card and I, I had the feeling that it was very dangerous, so I said to her, "Take...you go with me and let's go together, and you, you carry the, the identity card." </sentence><sentence id="477">And just before the <span class="building">station</span>, she broke the shoe...the, the, the lace of her shoe, and I was mad. </sentence><sentence id="478">And we missed the <span class="spatial object">train</span> because of that. </sentence><sentence id="479">Now what happened actually in <span class="populated place">Amersfoort</span> was that at one o'clock the whole <span class="building">house</span> was, uh, complete...completely circled...uh, how do you call it?... </sentence><sentence id="480">circled...by, by very, uh, well-armed German troops because he was so...that important, and, uh, they, they, they, uh, they rang the bell and they said he got...and the man who, who, who did it said, "I have a message from Esme," which is one of the... which was a good way to, to, to go into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="481">Because he didn't suspect anything at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="482">At that moment he, he came in and, uh, two minutes later he knew he was trapped. </sentence><sentence id="483">So he took...he tried to take his revolver and, uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: What happened when he approached the <span class="building">house</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="507">A: When he approached the <span class="building">house</span> he was let in and after two minutes, uh, Krijn, which was his name--Krijn van den Helm, realized that he was trapped and he tried to, to, to...he had this revolver in back the of his trousers and he, and he reached for it and he got it on the wrong...the wrong side and the man who was sitting in front of him shot him [NB: Krijn] dead immediately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="509">Q: In other words, who shot who? </sentence><sentence id="510">Just to clarify the situation with the two people involved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="513">Who was shot and who had the revolver? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="515">But the the the strange thing is that normally when, when things like that happened, the Germans stayed at the <span class="building">house</span> for twenty-four hours at least, to see what, what people came and they were caught there. </sentence><sentence id="516">That, that happened all the time. </sentence><sentence id="517">That was the biggest risk you had, that you walked to an address where the Germans had arrested someone, where they were still staying to look who was, who was coming. </sentence><sentence id="518">Now the funny...you know, the funny...the strange thing is, that they left at six o'clock and I arrived at, let's say, seven because of the fact that I had missed my <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and then when I, when I, uh, rang the <span class="dlf">doorbell</span>, she said, "Get out!" </sentence><sentence id="519">so I knew the whole thing was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="520">Well, that, that was just a lucky  1 escape and, and you know, you never know how, why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe, I wouldn't have survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: You mentioned there was another narrow escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: The other narrow escape was with my partner who was, uh, caught at the <span class="building">station</span> with all kinds of identity cards and, uh, and, uh, material which was absolutely very dangerous, but he was just caught as I tell you as a, as man, a boy of thirty years, twenty years, to be sent to to <span class="country">Germany</span> for work. </sentence><sentence id="531">But we didn't know if they had discovered all, all the material, so then the same man from from <span class="populated place">Friesland</span>, Krijn van den Helm, where I was just talking about...that was before he was killed... called him and said, What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="532">He's in...my partner Wouter's in <span class="building">jail</span> and I'm afraid. </sentence><sentence id="533">I don't know what he had, what he had with him." </sentence><sentence id="534">And he [NB: Krijn] came immediately to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, and he went to the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="535">And by time in "43 the Germans had a very strange law. </sentence><sentence id="536">All the students had to, uh, sign a loyal, uh, statement that they would be loyal to the German occu...occupation and German people or something like that, which was completely idiotic, because it was, it was a forced statement. </sentence><sentence id="537">But they they were very tough on that because they said, "If you don't sign it, either you can't study on, and your parents, especially your father, is responsible," and a lot of students signed because they didn't want their father to be responsible for, uh, what, what, what they did. </sentence><sentence id="538">It didn't occur to us because we were not studying anymore in "43, so there were, uh, there were student cards of of people who had signed and I went with the...with Krijn van Helm to the <span class="building">university</span>, and he went to the <span class="building">office</span> where they they gave away this...where they had the, uh, this, this...what do you call it?...college identification card, and he threatened him that he would kill him if he didn't give him a book of these, uh, identity cards, and he gave them. </sentence><sentence id="539">He immediately gave them. </sentence><sentence id="540">So what we did, we, uh, put a photo of my partner on it. </sentence><sentence id="541">It was signed in his name, and his sister went to the <span class="building">jail</span> and he was immediately freed. </sentence><sentence id="542">So that was a narrow escape, not for me personally but anyway for the whole group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: But in "43, the situation for Jews...there were no Jews at the <span class="building">university</span> then, were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: Why did you decide to get involved with the movement to begin with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="564">A: You don't decide that. </sentence><sentence id="565">It happens. </sentence><sentence id="566">It happens. </sentence><sentence id="567">I think for me, uh, sheer honesty,...it was when, when my friend was, uh, called <span class="building">home</span> and disappeared forever, and then you say, "What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="568">You are studying law. </sentence><sentence id="569">This is ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="570">There are so many other things which are much more important." </sentence><sentence id="571">I think that was the turning point for me. </sentence><sentence id="572">And then, then it goes on. </sentence><sentence id="573">Don't forget, we saw razzias in, in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="574">It's a terrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="575">I mean it's unbelievable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="588">Q: Can you describe one? </sentence><sentence id="589"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="593">It, it's...a whole <span class="dlf">block</span> of <span class="building">houses</span> is, is, is cut off by, by, by police and and army and they are going from every <span class="building">house</span>, looking for everyone. </sentence><sentence id="594">Everyone has to, to...had, had a persoonbewijs, and all Jews had a persoonbewijs with a J on it, so if you had not a persoonbewijs without a J, or if you had no persoonbewijs, you are taken, uh, with them, but they, they went from one <span class="building">house</span> to the other. </sentence><sentence id="595">They didn't have the, the, the addresses of the Jewish people themselves. </sentence><sentence id="596">No, they...that was the typical way they operated. </sentence><sentence id="597">They took a whole <span class="dlf">block</span> and looked for the Jews...in it. </sentence><sentence id="598">And, and then they brought them out, with children and everything. </sentence><sentence id="599">It was a terrible thing to see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Do you know why there was no list? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: There was a list. </sentence><sentence id="611">They, they they operated different. </sentence><sentence id="612">Sometimes..but a real razzia, in my opinion, is a, uh, search of all the <span class="building">houses</span>, and not on a certain address. </sentence><sentence id="613">Of course, they they, they, they, uh, took, uh, Jews from addresses, but that was individually. </sentence><sentence id="614">They went to a <span class="building">house</span> with three or four people, and they... and they rang the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and they saw they were at <span class="building">home</span> and then they took them. </sentence><sentence id="615">But that's not the same as a razzia. </sentence><sentence id="616">A razzia is...they wanted to, to, to...because there were a lot of people already hiding in, in, in, in the <span class="building">houses</span>, so they, they found that too, of course. </sentence><sentence id="617">If you had no identification, no persoonbewijs, they took you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="626">Q: When you would watch a razzia occurring, what would happen to the people that they would bring out of the <span class="building">homes</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="628">A: They, they, they, they were brought together and, and they went with them in, in <span class="spatial object">army cars</span> to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="629">And mostly they were taken immediately from the <span class="building">station</span> to <span class="populated place">Westerbork</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="782">Q: Then what happened to the child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: That's a very strange story because the girl who had adopted her or, or recognized it as, it as her as her son was one...was visiting the, the parents every...every month to give all kinds of things: coupons, uh, bread coupons, meat coupons... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="810">A: The girls did, but once in a while--not every month. </sentence><sentence id="811">That would be too much. </sentence><sentence id="812">And for instance, we had a <span class="building">center</span> in, in in <span class="populated place">Limburg</span>, in the <span class="region">South</span>, in <span class="populated place">Tienray</span> where we had 120 children and where there was a Jewish student and some others who stayed there and took care of all the children, so there you didn't have to, to go. </sentence><sentence id="813">We just brought the the children  5 there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="850">A: Uh, yeah...that's a question that you can only ask after the war. </sentence><sentence id="851">In the war you never asked what they were. </sentence><sentence id="852">If you had a hiding place, you had a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="853">You didn't ask what they were. </sentence><sentence id="854">We didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="855">We didn't care where...we were too happy to have an address. </sentence><sentence id="856">If they were Hindostaans"""...it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="857">The only thing which we took care of especially, because our south connection...we had to deal with the Bishop of Utrecht, that the children were not to be, uh, bap...baptized. </sentence><sentence id="858">Yeah? </sentence><sentence id="859">Is that right? </sentence><sentence id="860">Baptized. </sentence><sentence id="861">Of course, the children had to go to <span class="building">church</span> with the other children. </sentence><sentence id="862">Otherwise it would be too suspicious, and the children loved the <span class="building">Catholic church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="863">It's, it's really a great show, you know (laughter). </sentence><sentence id="864">So there was always the danger that they, they, they wanted to be baptized and and some of the the, the pastors would have loved to do that, but from, from the Bishop there was absolutely a, a, uh...it was forbidden to, to do that and in, in, in <span class="populated place">Tienray</span> where we had these...all these children, there was not one baptism. </sentence><sentence id="865">There have been cases, of course, that pastors disobeyed the orders of the Bishop and there there will be some baptized, but it was absolutely minimum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: Why did you decide first to work with helping to save the children rather than adults? </sentence><sentence id="883"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="886">A: No...it didn't happen that way. </sentence><sentence id="887">We were approached by the <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span> people about the children. </sentence><sentence id="888">So we have from the beginning in, in, in... we were working with the children and we knew that we, we couldn't do both. </sentence><sentence id="889">That would be absolutely impossible and we realized that if we had...there were...there were so many children. </sentence><sentence id="890">If, if, if I give you an example...I think that all the groups together...three or four groups, had 1200 children, which is peanuts compared to how many children there were. </sentence><sentence id="891">We couldn't do more. </sentence><sentence id="892">I mean it was...it was such a short time and you...so you have to concentrate on, on, on, on the children. </sentence><sentence id="893">If, if we didn't do it, we could...you would have done the work for children half and the work for adults half, so we decide very soon with the Utrecht group to...that we'd in principle only take care of children and let the adults be, uh, uh, hided by, by other other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: Was it harder working with the <span class="populated place">Utrecht</span> group, since the NSB"? </sentence><sentence id="903">was headquartered there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
