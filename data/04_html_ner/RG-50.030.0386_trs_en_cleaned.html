<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: I was a 4-F, but I -- I was born with a -- a -- a heart abnormality, which disqualified me for military service, but I still felt it was an event I wanted to observe first hand and I heard about the American field service, which sent ambulance drivers, as it had done in World War One, to <span class="country">Italy</span> and to the first French army, which was then not yet back actually into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">But I -- I drove an <span class="spatial object">ambulac-ambulance</span> for the American field service in the first French army. </sentence><sentence id="74">And when the war ended, I stayed on in <span class="country">Europe</span> and went to work for the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Did you -- can you remember, sort of any -- sort of quality, any values that were instilled about your family life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: In all honesty, I -- I mean it's -- I don't think I resented the inconveniences of being Jewish at that time, having to walk across <span class="populated place">town</span> all the time to get kosher meat and the -- but I -- I certainly observed the dietary laws. </sentence><sentence id="111">I just didn't eat at anybody else's <span class="building">house</span> because I -- and except for this close friend that I've been friends with from -- Joe Platt and I met as friends in the seventh grade, in <span class="building">junior high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">We went all through <span class="building">junior high school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span> and <span class="building">college</span> together, the <span class="building">University of Rochester</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">But whenever -- when -- when I went to his <span class="building">house</span> for a meal, which was the first time I ever ate anywhere else, his mother was very careful to give me -- give us a dairy meal, dairy foods, she just -- she realized I could not eat traifa food. </sentence><sentence id="114">But -- yeah, I had good friends, like Joe Platt, primarily Joe Platt and then I formed -- I did not join the Jewish fraternity at the <span class="building">University of Rochester</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">There was only one. </sentence><sentence id="116">And -- and then I went to <span class="building">law school</span>, first to <span class="region">Michigan</span> for one year, <span class="building">Michigan Law School</span> in "37, "38 and then to <span class="building">Yale Law School</span>, [indecipherable] graduated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: What -- did you have any -- were there any sort of cultural groups, any Zion-Zionist groups, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: I think I used, at one point, I belonged to some sort of a Jewish group, a -- the -- again it was in another section of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">Priorly, I -- I had very ex -- in th -- in those early days, very few Jewish friends and my closest friend was Joe Platt and the -- I guess a couple of the Italian, we grew -- this was an <span class="populated place">Italian neighborhood</span> and I guess I did have -- Frankie Deponzio was a pretty good friend. </sentence><sentence id="128">We li-lived -- our <span class="building">dry goods store</span> was next to the Deponzo's -- Deponzio's <span class="building">grocery store</span> on <span class="dlf">State Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">But I don't think I had any -- we - - we observed all of the holidays but I don't think I had any intent to get into Jewish affairs, it just worked out that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of, was there something about your family life, certain values you grew up with that in some way prepared you or motivated you later on to do the sort of work you did? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Oh, that's hard to -- that's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="136">I was a liberal, politically, I just seemed to be that way. </sentence><sentence id="137">I guess I identified with underdogs. </sentence><sentence id="138">I certainly felt that I was a minority and maybe that's what enabled me to identify. </sentence><sentence id="139">But I think I got into labor relations work because they were do-gooders. </sentence><sentence id="140">I joined it -- I belonged to this union when I peddled ice and I wrote the term paper, something about that experience. </sentence><sentence id="141">So | identified and my parents were both members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. </sentence><sentence id="142">I knew the head of the Amalgamated in <span class="populated place">Rochester</span>, in fact he was a close friend of my family's and so I -- I -- I had, somehow this moving in that direction. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Socially motivated? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="150">You -- you were starting to say that you wanted to -- to be part of the war effort, you couldn't go as a soldier, so I think you heard about the <span class="building">American Field Service</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: We're jumping ahead a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="206">I want -- I want to ask you a couple questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Just quickly back to the <span class="building">AFS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Were you -- when you were driving <span class="spatial object">ambulances</span>, were you able to observe anything about what was going on in the war, or about <span class="populated place">camps</span>, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Really only once. </sentence><sentence id="216">We met a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> survivor on a <span class="dlf">road</span>, he had wandered off by himself and his head was shaven and -- this is while I'm driving an <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span>, before I've gone to work for the <span class="building">JDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I think he'd -- I'm not sure whether he was still wearing <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> pajamas, but then we -- when I went to work for the <span class="building">JDC</span>, of course, that was in the early days after the war and that was -- those first -- those six months between May -- if that's when I went to work for the <span class="building">JDC</span>, in -- no, we said I was in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> first. </sentence><sentence id="218">In July of "45, I went back int-into <span class="country">Germany</span> and worked at <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> until - - which was this first Jewish all <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>, until December, "45 and there -- there were some very, very emotional experiences. </sentence><sentence id="219">People did not know, initially, that their families had been decimated. </sentence><sentence id="220">They were separated. </sentence><sentence id="221">People who could work were sent to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">Nobody knew yet about the -- the <span class="populated place">death camps</span> or even the full extent of the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I remember one man in particular who had just learned about what had happened to his family and I was there in this JDC uniform, which was like a  military uniform and I was good, strong physical condition and I remember his walking up to me, with tears, he had just learned apparently, about what had happened to his family. </sentence><sentence id="224">And he said to me in Yiddish, "Dusha svair itsa zine a Yid." </sentence><sentence id="225">It is hard to be a Jew and -- with tears flowing down his face. </sentence><sentence id="226">That was -- I met, I'm sure -- I mean, stationed at <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>, I met a lot of people, but in those early days, when it was just being learned by these people who had been separated, that they -- their families had been liquidated, that became a very emotional kind of period to work -- to be working with those people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: How much did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I don't think I knew much. </sentence><sentence id="242">I mean, I had driven the <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> and I'd met this one guy, who -- who mentioned something about what had happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then I came to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and people began their -- come into <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and we learned from some of them, what had been happening. </sentence><sentence id="244">The awareness of what had been done by the Germans to the Jews of <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Russia</span>, did not take place until sometime after the war. </sentence><sentence id="245">There just wasn't the communication, there wasn't the information and -- course the average German said he didn't know, she didn't know about it either. </sentence><sentence id="246">But there were relatives who must have come back from the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> who must have told them what Hitler was doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I'm going to stop the tape here, because we need to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: As much -- you know, I -- I'm stopping you because there's much o-of this sort of personal detail, you think it's really helpful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Well I -- I've been... End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Okay, we were starting to talk a little bit about your work with the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">And I have a couple questions I'd like to throw out and then sort of let you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: -- tell me. </sentence><sentence id="269">The first is, what your primary responsibilities were there. </sentence><sentence id="270">What, you know, what kind of work you were involved in, cause I know they -- they were trying to accomplish a lot and also what -- what credentials you had or what experience you had for the kind of work that you would be doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Well my only credentials were that A -- I knew something about <span class="country">Germany</span> because I'd been driving an <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> there and we would be sending people in to work in <span class="country">Germany</span>, in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> and the <span class="building">JDC</span> initially had nobody in parts -- those parts of <span class="country">Germany</span> or even in the northern -- the <span class="region">British occupied parts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">So I -- I certainly could be helpful in the red tape of getting somebody into <span class="country">Germany</span> and -- and then we had dealings with the French-Jewish community and I had fairly good command of French, I had had a lot of French in <span class="building">school</span> and then I -- when I drove an <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> for the first French army, we spoke a lot of French, so that was kind of -- but I think mainly there was nobody else for them to hire and they desperately needed people for whatever programs they could organize. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: And then sort of let you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Well, Larry would correspond with -- whether he worked with the <span class="building">UNRA tracing bureau</span> or directly with the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="361">But he would get names, I think primarily of people who -- who came in and -- and said they heard there was a <span class="building">tracing bureau</span> or maybe we had a branch in the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> and said, "Would you help me, I don't have the -- the address, I have a relative, my mother spoke of a relative who had migrated to the <span class="country">States</span> and he lives in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>, but I don't know anything more about that, I don't know where he lives. </sentence><sentence id="362">I don't have his address, but I would like to make contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="363">I would like to go to the <span class="country">States</span> and he could help me and -- or the family could help me." </sentence><sentence id="364">And so we tried to -- so -- and we had facilities in the <span class="country">States</span>, in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">But sometimes, with no more than a name, we would try to find somebody in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> and -- and sometimes we were successful. </sentence><sentence id="366">I've forgotten what facilities there might have been in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">I suppose we used the local <span class="building">United Jewish Appeal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">I've forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="369">Anyway, then we -- Larry Lebetsky got word back, in -- in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> or <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, that there was a relative in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">And he posted this on the <span class="spatial object">bulletin board</span>, saying, "Mr. blank Cohen, of this <span class="populated place">town</span>, please come in, we have found your relative in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>." </sentence><sentence id="371">And then a couple of days later, somebody comes in and says, "My name is Cohen, but how did you know about my relatives in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="372">And we said, "Somebody was just here two days ago and he's asking us." </sentence><sentence id="373">And that's -- was his first knowledge that he -- that brother had survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: In those early days, everybody was doing it on his own. </sentence><sentence id="391">People would come back to their <span class="populated place">hometowns</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, there was no <span class="spatial object">public transportation</span> and they would often walk and thumb rides and whatnot from the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, to get back to <span class="country">Poland</span>, to try to find their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="392">And then they would find that there was nobody left there and -- and  0 they turned around and came back into occupied <span class="country">Germany</span>, where there were American organizations that could help them go to <span class="country">Palestine</span> or to the <span class="country">States</span>, to find relatives. </sentence><sentence id="393">I mean there was a s -- quite a lot of that by the survivors, trying to find each other. </sentence><sentence id="394">And Larry Lebetsky ran this <span class="building">tracing bureau</span> in our <span class="building">office</span> to try to contact people together. </sentence><sentence id="395">How he did it, the details of it, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="396">But he -- he was competent and I'm sure we -- we did a lot of that successfully. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: As I said, we could not have brought in supplies, so all we could do was help out with things like uniting families, helping people to migrate, getting them visas to the <span class="country">States</span> and we had people in the <span class="country">States</span> that we could contact. </sentence><sentence id="411">We also tried to furnish some social amenities. </sentence><sentence id="412">For example, we decided one day -- there was a <span class="dlf">c-central</span> -- there was a c -- there were committees. </sentence><sentence id="413">You'd put a bunch of Jews in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> and you've got <span class="building">UNRA</span> and whatnot, but you're soon going to have a <span class="building">Jewish committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">And there was a central committee of -- of surviving Jews in <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">The head of which was a Dr. Chaim Greenberg, he was actually a medical doctor and oh, there's a wonderful <span class="building">monastery</span> that became a -- a place for surviving Jewish DP's, where he was and that was a -- a big function and to the extent that we could bring in supplies to supplement what was available. </sentence><sentence id="416">The <span class="building">JDC</span> brought in a -- a -- a lot of supplies, I think from the <span class="region">Scandinavian countries</span> in those early days, when it was important to have. </sentence><sentence id="417">And we had packages -- we -- from <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, from <span class="region">Scandinavia</span> and in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, it became an advantage. </sentence><sentence id="418">Under the Nazis, you didn't want to proclaim your Jewishness, if you were living as a Jew -- living in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> instead of having been deported, you had been hiding or whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="419">And y-you -- you had people who were 50 percent Jewish, 25 percent Jewish, who'd been in hiding, or they didn't have food cards because they didn't want to proclaim. </sentence><sentence id="420">So they -- life would have been sort of difficult for them and these <span class="spatial object">packages</span>, but there became a question of how did you identify yourself, how could you claim you were a b -- you were a Jew, if -- because everybody now wanted to -- the irony of ironies, everybody in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> now wanted to -- if they were even an eighth Jewish, they -- they proclaimed it and they -- they wanted to get these -- and we had the phrase, "Packett Yim." </sentence><sentence id="421">Package Jews, [inaudible]. </sentence><sentence id="422">They -- and it was understandable. </sentence><sentence id="423">What got me off on that? </sentence><sentence id="424">What could the <span class="building">JDC</span> do? </sentence><sentence id="425">Well, we -- we could supplement and we could help with migration. </sentence><sentence id="426">We could help with tracing, Larry Lebetsky did that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="590">A: To my <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="591">There had been criticism by visiting delegations of the army and UNRA's performances in the immediate post-war period, where these <span class="populated place">displaced person's camps</span> were terribly overcrowded and lacking in supplies. </sentence><sentence id="592">And this army West Pointer, I think he was a colonel, a young, lean Texan, who was in charge of something in that <span class="region">area</span> and i- it -- I wrote somewhere that it was really unfair to put this burden on these army guys, who were not trained at all in this kind of stuff and -- and this officer came in after the criticism had gone to the <span class="country">States</span> and Eisenhower then visited the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, because of the word of the overcrowded conditions and -- and a lot had been done in -- in -- in that week. </sentence><sentence id="593">And he came in to my <span class="building">office</span> and he said, "Do you agree that we've done a lot in this past week?" </sentence><sentence id="594">And I said, "Yes, you have." </sentence><sentence id="595">And he said, "Would you make a public statement to that effect?" </sentence><sentence id="596">And I said, "That's not for me, I'm just a lowly figure here in this <span class="building">office</span>," and I could imagine if this would be used -- it was just one thing and there was such legitimate outrage at the -- the dawning awareness of what had happened to the Jews and how little was being done to help the survivors in those early days. </sentence><sentence id="597">And to indicate that in one place -- to counter that by saying there's been some improvement in one, small segment, was something I felt would not be my job, as a -- just a director in <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">But they -- they did, I mean, they got on the ball, after the -- the initial period of inaction, when there was so much criticism. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="661"> A Well, it's hard to separate in my mind, the Eisenhower-Patton visit, which was some months after my first arrival there. </sentence><sentence id="662">Conditions, I think, on my first exposure to <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> were worse than -- I mean th-they gradually improved, but it was overcrowded. </sentence><sentence id="663"><span class="spatial object">Bunks</span> -- it had been just sort of a -- a <span class="populated place">military camp</span> with <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> from the <span class="interior space">floor</span> to the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span> and -- and it was -- there just wasn't enough <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">And supplies were inadequate and people expected that we, as the Joint Distribution Committee, would come in -- I mean this was the big Jewish relief organization, going back to 1910 or so, the European Jews knew about their -- their Joint, it wasn't called the <span class="building">JDC</span>, it was the <span class="building">Joint</span>. </sentence><sentence id="665">And they expected that we would come in and <span class="env feature">reef</span> -- after -- after everything they'd been through, surely the <span class="building">Joint</span> would -- would now -- could perform it's traditional role. </sentence><sentence id="666">But we couldn't and -- and I've forgotten the phrase we use, but they mimicked it -- they even quoted us unfavorably, "Here's what the <span class="building">Joint</span> says," or -- and -- but we couldn't do any more than just be there as a physical presence in those very early days to -- it -- it had some morale value, when they hadn't seen anything except their <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> persecutors or Germans, or Poles, to see and American team of Jews -- or headed by somebody like myself. </sentence><sentence id="667">It -- it was a -- a sort of an emotional catharsis for a lot of those people in those early days, too. </sentence><sentence id="668">And later I'll -- I'Il see what I have left in my <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="669">The JDC made it -- took a picture of me, which they used for -- or maybe it was the j -- united UJA putting a -- trying out a shoe on a little girl who was raggedly dressed and this became -- I think it was on the fr-front page of the Jewish exfonit in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="670">The -- but it -- it -- there was a -- a -- and you know I had not been strongly Jewish identified, but this -- this awakened not a -- not only identification, but anger that so little was being done, or anger over what had been done. </sentence><sentence id="671">And the -- and it's -- I'd never hidden my Jewishness and I certainly, even though I hadn't been much of a Jew in the <span class="country">States</span> -- a Rosh Hashonah Jew and I didn't do anything in <span class="building">Jewish organizations</span> in those early years, I -- I -- I never attempted to escape or hide my Jewishness. </sentence><sentence id="672">So it was clearly an emotional experience. </sentence><sentence id="673">The -- identifying with these people. </sentence><sentence id="674"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="689">Q: Why couldn't you do more for them, initially? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="691">A: Well, the <span class="building">JDC</span> had not been able to bring supplies during the war. </sentence><sentence id="692">Under the Nazis you couldn't bring anything in. </sentence><sentence id="693">And in -- in the post-war period, or the period after <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was liberated, the -- they just -- the shipping was not available. </sentence><sentence id="694">We did bring some things from <span class="country">Norway</span> and some things from <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but the war with <span class="country">Japan</span> was still going on and it was very -- th-the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were being used to transport troops and whatnot to the - - in the <span class="env feature">Pacific</span> to the battle -- the expected forthcoming battle with -- with <span class="country">Japan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">I -- I don't remember precisely why we couldn't do more. </sentence><sentence id="696">I do know the -- the expressions of disappointment and anger that the <span class="building">American Joint</span> could do so little for these survivors in that immediate period. </sentence><sentence id="697">That's -- that was before we even -- you know that -- that load of packages that we brought in from <span class="country">Switzerland</span> or from <span class="country">Norway</span>, were just packages. </sentence><sentence id="698">They weren't the basic food supplies that these people needed. </sentence><sentence id="699">And clothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: But when you saw these people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: But when I saw them -- I was not in any of those <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> immediately after the war. </sentence><sentence id="716">The one -- the only one that is -- not even a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it was a -- well, there was <span class="populated place">Wittenau</span>, but in the immediate liberation period, I don't think I saw any of these skeletal survivors. </sentence><sentence id="717">I did see more of them when I went back into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="718">At <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>, people were still coming in from the <span class="region">east</span>, but eve -- but even by then they were no longer the emaciated <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> figures that we associate with that immediate post-war period. </sentence><sentence id="719">But I certainly identified with them and felt that all of this could have happened to me if my parents hadn't migrated. </sentence><sentence id="720">I-It's not only the Jewishness that came to the surface but the whole American upbringing of believing in justice and fair play and fighting for the underdog, which was something I grew up with. </sentence><sentence id="721">I read a lot of fiction and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="722">I had this sympathy for the underdog, wherever it came from. </sentence><sentence id="723">And that plus the Jewish identification made this quite an emotional catharsis kind of thing for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="910">A: Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="911">I -- I didn't feel that I could comply with the wishes of this <span class="populated place">West Point</span> Lieutenant Colonel or if that -- to send out an official statement as a representative of the JDC, that all was well, or that things had greatly improved. </sentence><sentence id="912">I said, "That's something -- th-that's only something that the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> would authorize," and to give the impression that all -- th-this could be interpreted as meaning that the army had discharged it's responsibilities and all was well, when in fact that was not true. </sentence><sentence id="913">And the army -- I -- I was never critical of the army, I felt th-they were simply not equipped, not trained to be relief workers, particularly for this unprecedented situation of highly -- the people were distraught, as they were beginning to realize what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="914">And they were unwilling to stay in <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they -- some of them immediately started to do black marketing and we had a situation in which -- a friend of mine, later he came to <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, I -- I don't think he's a-around any more, who was one of the people -- he was a part of the camp -- the people elected their own camp committee in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="915">Elected them, picked them or somehow. </sentence><sentence id="916">People who were going to be there for awhile and Joe Lifshitz, who later came to <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span> had it -- was a member of that committee and the -- and they acquired -- I think they -- some guns or something. </sentence><sentence id="917">They -- as a police organization they had to have some -- some firearms. </sentence><sentence id="918">And the army somehow learned that these difficult people or -- had armaments and they raided <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> in the middle of the night, rousted everybody out, to find these armaments. </sentence><sentence id="919">And they arrested these several people who were on the <span class="building">camp committee</span> and it was so stupid, I mean it was so reminiscent of what these people had suffered under -- under the -- the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="920">And -- and then to arrest some of them for having unauthorized -- I remembered there was a military judge, a military government or an army judge, before whom they were brought and I went with them to this judge, who was a very decent man and I -- I said, "Look,  1 your honor, this is ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="921">You know, these people are our friends, they're our allies." </sentence><sentence id="922">And -- you know, he -- he -- he immediately agreed and he discharged them, but the army had been so stupid in arresting these people and treating them as though they were just like some Germans who were somehow violating the regulations. </sentence><sentence id="923">And -- so that was something -- one -- one instance. </sentence><sentence id="924">But I was -- there was this Major Fisher at -- third army. </sentence><sentence id="925">Eisen -- Patton's army was the famous third army and they -- their <span class="building">headquarters</span> were just outside of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and they had -- th-th-they were in charge of -- of these <span class="region">areas</span> where these <span class="populated place">camps</span> were and f -- I went over to this guy, Major Fisher, in Patton's <span class="building">headquarters</span>, who was presumably in charge of this sort of thing and I said, "Look, can't you do something to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>? </sentence><sentence id="926">It's terrible. </sentence><sentence id="927">The -- after what these people have been through." </sentence><sentence id="928">And I'd been driving through <span class="region">Bavaria</span> to try to find a place that -- a <span class="dlf">farm</span> or a <span class="populated place">German army camp</span> or something that could be used and there is this <span class="populated place">Wulfratshausen</span> -- what did I -- did I say there was another name for it? </sentence><sentence id="929">Did I mention that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: [inaudible] <span class="populated place">hausen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: Anyway, which is not far from <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>, which is a series of small <span class="building">buildings</span> with <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span> and whatnot, which the -- the Germans had used for, I think army people and the -- there were Polish officers, or members -- Poles, who had somehow taken control of that and were living there. </sentence><sentence id="953">And -- and it was outrageous that these Poles, many of whom had fled because of their -- not only bec -- some because they didn't want to live under the Russians, but others because they were afraid they'd be made to pay for their anti-Jewish and whatnot actions under the Nazis -- their collaborations. </sentence><sentence id="954">And -- and I -- I said to Fisher, "Can't we use this <span class="populated place">Wulfratshausen c-camp</span>, with it's wonderful facilities, to siphon off this overcrowding at -- at -- in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="955">And he brushed me aside and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="956">Then came the day when Eisenhower and Patton were visiting and there was the conversation where Eisenhower -- where they saw the -- the <span class="spatial object">sewing machines</span> without <span class="dlf">bases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="957">And we were walking away and they were talking about how overcrowded it was and this f -- that was when I heard Fisher for the first time say, "Oh, by the way generals, we're about to relieve this overcrowding by this new <span class="populated place">Jewish displaced person's camp</span>, which we are just opening in <span class="populated place">Wulfratshausen</span>." </sentence><sentence id="958">And that was -- up to then he had firmly refused to entertain that idea and I-I heard it for the first time when he felt that he had a problem and he'd better try to do something to protect himself. </sentence><sentence id="959">So that was something I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="968">Q: Now, at this -- at this point in time, was <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> mixed Jewish and non-Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="970">A: No, no, it -- it became all Jewish fairly -- fairly soon after -- oh, I don't know, after the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="971">The -- it was just so plain that you couldn't keep them in -- Jews and non-Jews together in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">First because of the Jewish needs and second because of the hostility the Jews felt towards the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="973">They -- and they, as I say -- and many of those Poles included people who had come voluntarily to <span class="country">Germany</span> to work for the Germans in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="974"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="980">Q: So this happened before Eisenhower came over there? </sentence><sentence id="981">He came in September. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="984"> A Of "45. </sentence><sentence id="985">Yeah, I sus -- well, but it was in this visit by Eisenhower and Patton, where Fisher, for the first time, mentioned that <span class="populated place">Wulfratshausen</span> was now going to be used for Jewish DP's, but when were the Polish DP's moved out? </sentence><sentence id="986">Somewhere around that time. </sentence><sentence id="987">It -- it was just clear you couldn't kee -- I think they were only together for a short time after the war in the same <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="988">I-It was very clear you couldn't keep them -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="994">Q: And it was Jewish DP's who were moved to <span class="populated place">Wulfratshausen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: Yeah, that's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="999">What other improvements do you think were a result of the Eisenhower visit? </sentence><sentence id="1000">Or of the Harrison report for that matter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: Ah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1005">I -- I spoke to Earl Harrison, a Philadelphian and connected with <span class="populated place">Wilosco</span>, I believe, at <span class="populated place">Penn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1006">On his way -- he and Joe Schwartz made this visit to <span class="country">Germany</span> in the period after the war and they stopped off at the <span class="building">JDC office</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, where I was then located and I -- I think I -- well, Schwartz didn't -- I had some meeting with -- with Harrison where I -- I think I told him what to -- or suggested what to look for and just told him whatever I could, whatever he might ask me about his forthcoming visit. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Now it was that visit that -- was that where they recommended that X number of people be sent to <span class="country">Palestine</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1008">Was that -- yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But I only saw him in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, I did not -- either it was before I'd gone back into <span class="country">Germany</span> or after I'd come out, I've forgotten when, but I definitely spoke to him in -- in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, on his way into <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1010">The -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of the impact of both Harrison's visit and Eisenhower's visit and how it enabled you to make some improvements, if -- if at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: Yeah, I don't think -- I don't know, I don't think the Harrison visit, as such, made a difference. </sentence><sentence id="1021">But the Eisenhower visit did, because it was right after the Eisenhower visit that this -- oh, what was his name -- this colonel -- this <span class="region">Texas</span> fighting officer came in and said -- to my <span class="building">office</span> and said, "My career is in the army, I -- I've fought valiantly in -- in the war and now my reputation is being jeopardized by this criticism of these conditions in my <span class="region">area</span> -- in my <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And -- tell me what I should do -- tell me what I can do. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I -- I -- I don't want this hang -- this hanging over me or ruining my record and I-I'1l do whatever I can." </sentence><sentence id="1024">And -- and I f -- I can't remember what I told him precisely. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I guess he did not have any supplies, but I -- it was -- it was a friendly meeting, I sympathized with him. </sentence><sentence id="1026">He hadn't been trained for this sort of thing and -- and I sympathized with Patton too. </sentence><sentence id="1027">I mean these were my friends, they had fought the Nazis and I didn't want to see them -- and I just felt they weren't trained for this sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: So when he said, "What can I do to keep my reputation intact," what -- what did you say? </sentence><sentence id="1037"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: I -- I must have said, "Well, if there's any way you can help us get more supplies and to create more <span class="populated place">camps</span> to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1041">And I know I traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="1042">I went th-through <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span>, <span class="region">parts of Bavaria</span> at that point, looking for a possible place that we could set up another <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> and the -- and I -- this parenthetically, I would stop at military government officers -- <span class="building">offices</span>, through these other parts of <span class="country">Germany</span>, not just <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span> and in one of them, the military government officer in charge of this question was R.W. Fleming, Robin W. Fleming, who had been f -- he was later the president of the <span class="building">University of Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Oh -- umnot much more important job later. </sentence><sentence id="1044">He was a friend of mine, we had shared <span class="building">offices</span> together in the <span class="building">War Labor Board</span> and so I -- he was as surprised to see me as I was to see his name and -- but I was looking for <span class="region">areas</span> and I asked him t -- if he had any suggestions that could be used to set up a new displaced person's camp, to relieve the -- the overcrowding at <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> and I just don't remember how that worked out -- whether UNRA created another <span class="building">facility</span> to relieve the overcrowding at <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> or whether people just left. </sentence><sentence id="1045">They didn't want to stay in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> of course, they wanted to get to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And there was this other <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> that I think might have been created to relieve the overcrowding at <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But there was some improvement, I don't remember the details, nor my -- my role. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: What -- you had mentioned <span class="building">Black Market</span> activities. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Was there a lot of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1060">A: Oh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1061">The -- there was a lot of it by everybody, but -- in that -- in the post- war period. </sentence><sentence id="1062">The -- there were Jews living in regular -- out of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, they had managed to establish themselves in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and -- where they had some money and they didn't -- if you could avoid living in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, you of course, did and there were these people living in <span class="interior space">apartments</span> and whatnot in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and for awhile we had an -- a <span class="building">JDC office</span> in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> on <span class="dlf">Kaunenstrasser</span> -- K-a-u-n. And black marketing was rife. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I suspect it always is where you have this kind of a -- a rigorously controlled economy, with great shortages. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And the -- and there were, I'm sure, Jewish black marketers and some of them were probably living in <span class="populated place">Feldifing</span> and I don't know, I think they lived in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> mostly. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And I don't remember defending anybody who was arrested for black marketing. </sentence><sentence id="1066">The only <span class="building">court</span> appearance I remember was for these -- the camp committee guys, who had firearms and were arrested. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1074">Q: So there wasn't much effort to control this <span class="building">black market</span> activity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1076">A: No and I don't know how -- oh, I'm sure the army made efforts and there may have been some arrests I didn't know about. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I -- I wasn't in charge of all -- of all of the Jews of <span class="region">Bavaria</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1080">Q: Another <span class="region">area</span> that's -- I'm curious about, there was a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, not a DP ca -- you know, not a [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: The Centralle Committee of Liberated Jews of <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span> was the committee that had established itself. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Central Committee of Liberated Jews of <span class="region">Bavaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1090">A doctor Greenberg, I believe, was the chairman. </sentence><sentence id="1091">He was a medical doctor and -- who had somehow survived and -- there were people who were in fairly good physical condition and maybe they'd lived in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> or something of that sort and they had decent clothing and -- and Dr. Greenberg went to <span class="country">Palestine</span> before too long, but he was just a natural leader and he was the leader of this Central Committee, and there were several other people whose names I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1092">But they were located in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and maybe in the same <span class="building">building</span> where we had our <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I certainly would have wanted to help them to the extent that I could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1100">Q: Was there a relationship between the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and the <span class="populated place">DP community</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1102">A: The German Jewish community in -- which I was more familiar with in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> than in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> was composed of people who were 100 percent Jewish, people who were 75, 50, 25 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1103">There was a whole <span class="region">range</span> and of course the -- the 25 percenters were persecuted much less than the 100 percenters. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I mean, they were not sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1105">They might have had reduced rations, but they had more than the 50 or 75.Everything was, you know, German -- meticulously worked out. </sentence><sentence id="1106">If you -- if you ca -- you got a better card if you were only a 25 percent Jew than if you were a 75 percent Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I remember that and the -- so there was -- no, wait a minute, no. </sentence><sentence id="1108">It's the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="1109">People suddenly proclaimed their Jewishness because -- there was, I know, some sort of a <span class="spatial object">table</span> and I guess people -- if you got more as a 75 percenter or even a 100 percenter, people were now emerging and claiming to be Jews because they wanted the favorable treatment of supplies and getting more food, getting packetten -- packages. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: The eastern European Jews -- the -- there had traditionally certainly been a distinction, culturally, whatnot, between the German Jews and the Austume, that's what they were called. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And when the war ended, eastern European Jews were in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and <span class="region">Bavaria</span> not only from having survived the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but they were now pouring in to get out of <span class="country">Poland</span>, as the Russians prepared to take over all of <span class="country">Poland</span> and -- and irony of ironies, the place they ran for refuge and escape was <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Voluntarily coming into the <span class="country">Germany</span> that had so destroyed the -- the -- the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And th -- and <span class="country">Germany</span> became a haven -- primarily the <span class="region">American occupied areas</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1584">A: Around "47, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1585">That's -- and I stayed in <span class="populated place">New York</span> from "47 to "51 or so, working for the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> on various things, including the <span class="building">Claims Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1586">The people -- did I describe that, the -- the -- there were, in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, I think that I must have started this -- there were people who had jewelry, who had dollars and the JDC, under Gussic had a program in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1587">What had been in the JDC program in -- in <span class="country">Poland</span> before the war and <span class="populated place">Gussic</span> borrowed from -- in <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Gussic</span> and -- to bring in supplies and things for the people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1588">Needed money, needed -- and he would borrow jewelry and money and whatnot from people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, so he could bring in supplies from outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and -- but he owed those people and after the war, there were people who had some sort of writing -- wh -- they came to the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and they said, "My uncle or my brother or I loaned money to the <span class="building">JDC</span> in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span> that -- and I was glad to do it, I could get -- I felt safe I'd be paid -- repaid someday," and w -- but we couldn't just automatically honor every claim, people could -- there could be fraud, so we set up a -- the JDC in <span class="populated place">New York</span> set up a Claims Committee, and I, as the JDC's counsel in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, worked with that Claims Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And that was an interesting experience -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1610">Q: Through the -- through the <span class="building">Joint</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1612">A: That was a really interesting experience. </sentence><sentence id="1613">The -- the <span class="building">JDC</span> had borrowed, in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Gussic</span> and his -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1616">Q: All right, you -- actually you had explained this, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1618">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1619">All right, so now we have to pay back these loans and the records are poor and the <span class="building">JDC</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> is beginning to get requests for repayment, either by the people that loaned the money directly, or the jewelry or whatnot, or relatives, and relatives who -- who only heard that their father or brother or uncle had loaned something to the <span class="building">JDC</span>, they had nothing in writing. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Those relatives had died and they just felt that while they were glad to make contributions and so forth, to the United Jewish Appeal, if these were loans, it was supposed to be repaid, as was promised at the time, they would like to have repayments. </sentence><sentence id="1621">The <span class="building">Joint</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> recognized the validity of that position, but it wasn't about to give away stuff or recognize fraudulent claims. </sentence><sentence id="1622">So it appointed a <span class="building">Claims Commission</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1623">The chairman's name escapes me at the moment, but there was a chairman and I think two people, one of them a lawyer -- Saul -- Saul something was the chairman. </sentence><sentence id="1624">I got the first name. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And I worked with them, I was then the <span class="building">JDC</span>'s <span class="building">house</span> counsel. </sentence><sentence id="1626">I had come back, I wasn't ready to go back -- come back to my old career and I wanted to stay in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and so Moe Levitt hired me and he needed -- he -- my legal background was attractive to him because the <span class="building">JDC</span> was just now getting into restitution and reparations and he felt that having a lawyer in -- in the <span class="building">JDC headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> would be a good idea and I -- I -- I wanted to s-stay in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, for whatever the reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And for about -- I think four years, that I lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, from "47 to "51, I worked for the JDC and th-the Claims Committee was one of the as -- working with the Claims Committee was one aspect of my work for the JDC and it -- it was really an interesting, challenging kind of -- what do you do? </sentence><sentence id="1628">You've got -- you know you borrowed from people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, you know that you offered to repay them and yet here are people without proof, they only heard from their relatives or they had -- they had -- th -- there was not -- know diday were no records and so we set up this <span class="building">Claims Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Saul -- Saul what's his name and somebody named Stuart, to constitute a <span class="building">Claims Commission</span> to pass on these claims. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And we interviewed people, we looked at whatever records and I did -- I was sort of the staff person for that committee. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And -- and we paid back some claims. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Not in full, it was -- sorry -- number usually partial payment. </sentence><sentence id="1633">But these were legitimate claims and at the same time, we had to be protected against  5 unverifiable or fraudulent claims. </sentence><sentence id="1634">So I did that with the <span class="building">JDC</span> for just -- I don't know how long. </sentence><sentence id="1635">When I was just living in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1654">Q: And then did that -- did that than grow into a larger <span class="building">restitution organization</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1656">A: Well, then -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1658">Q: Wait a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1660">A: Then, separately, there was this restitution program. </sentence><sentence id="1661">The -- as though -- programs were set up for claims by -- from the Germans, to <span class="dlf">property</span> th-that had been taken away by the Germans and the allies set up s -- 1 mean the Americans, the British were less interested in it, I think and I don't remember what the Russians had -- we had four powers, but the Americans did something to help people claim back either what the Germans had confiscated or which they had left behind. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And then there was the whole business of what do you do with heirless Jewish property left in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1663">That were -- these were -- this was property that was going to remain in the hands of the Germans, if the su -- nothing was done and it would remain in the hands in those cases, where the Germans had been most successful in destroying the Jews, because there were no heirs. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So where they had been most successful, they would be rewarded by retaining the <span class="dlf">property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1665">Well, obviously this was unacceptable, so an organization was created, called the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, to reclaim heirless <span class="dlf">Jewish property</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Meant primarily the <span class="region">American occupied areas</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And I worked with earso as we called it, as did Mikania Robinson, who was with the World Jewish Congress, stationed in -- in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1668">The two of us really did the organizing of that program and then in <span class="country">Germany</span>, Benjamin Firenze, who had re-remained in <span class="country">Germany</span> after the Nuremberg Trials, where he had worked with Maxwell Taylor. </sentence><sentence id="1669">Ben either went back into <span class="country">Germany</span> or stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And he undertook a program to find heirless Jewish property in -- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And -- and then we made claims for the -- the heirless property in -- in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, which is only recently surfaced. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I'm -- I don't know why, I don't re-remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="1673">But I was -- I definitely worked with the <span class="building">Jewish Restitution Successor Organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I helped establish it with Mikania Robinson and in the <span class="building">State Department</span> recognized it as -- which didn't come easy, some of the old line <span class="building">State Department</span> types did not like the idea, but this became the official Jewish Restitution Successor Organization for heirless Jewish property that was unclaimed, anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="1675">And it was used to -- the proceeds were used for <span class="country">Israel</span> -- <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Now, the Swiss have recently -- what is it that the Swiss have done recently? </sentence><sentence id="1677">They've just recently acknowledged that there is heirless Jewish property in their hands, that the Jews who were being deported and whatnot, people transferred their assets to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and no one ever claimed them because their families were wiped out and there were no records and the Swiss, I think, had hoped just to keep it, because there were no claimants and now there is some sort of effort. </sentence><sentence id="1678">But the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization did not -- I don't think -- function in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, it just functioned in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And Benjamin Firenze ran the program from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and I ran it from the <span class="building">JDC offices</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I -- I worked on it with Robinson. </sentence><sentence id="1681"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1706">A: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1707">We -- <span class="populated place">Firenze</span> did, I'm sure, a great job of finding heirless <span class="dlf">Jewish property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Ha -- it's a needle in a haystack, in a sense. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I mean, how do -- you have records, I guess, but who were the -- the Jewish -- in heirless cases, there was -- I mean, if there were any relatives who had claims, you had something to go on, but without heirs, I just don't remember how he -- he operated, how he found <span class="dlf">property</span>, but he found property. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And the odinor government was -- I mean that was -- h-he was a good person and they cooperated in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1711">The -- but I -- I -- I'm not su -- seven hundred million dollars, does that sound right for the value of the heirless Jewish property? </sentence><sentence id="1712">Most of which was used for <span class="country">Palestine</span>, I'm pretty sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1720">Q: Must have been hard to corroborate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1727">The -- it was a hit and miss sort of thing, as I recall, but gee, I'm not too clear on the details of -- of earso. </sentence><sentence id="1728"><span class="populated place">Firenze</span> would -- would have a -- he -- did you say he's been interviewed? </sentence><sentence id="1729">Yeah, he would certainly know more about that. </sentence><sentence id="1730">And there was a guy that worked with him who later took my job at the -- succeeded me at the <span class="building">Joint</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, <span class="populated place">Kaden</span>, <span class="populated place">Kazen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1731">Can't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1740">A: Oh, he's -- he's great. </sentence><sentence id="1741">I'd love to see him. </sentence><sentence id="1742">He was extremely able, very bright and energetic. </sentence><sentence id="1743">A little guy, he's oh, about five two or so and -- but much bigger, in reality. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And I guess he's practicing law in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> or -- years ago I had some contact with him, but we've had no -- no reason to be in contact with each other. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Wonderful, wonderful person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1752">Q: Let me ask you, sort of on a <span class="interior space">personal level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1753">The impact all these experiences have had on you, have they changed you? </sentence><sentence id="1754">Did they change you, I should say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1758">A: Well, at the time, I-I certainly don't -- they caused this strong re-identification with my background, my heritage. </sentence><sentence id="1759">I'm a pretty proud Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1760">I mean I think we have a wonderful history and I'm very happy to be part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1761">The -- go back these thousands of years and we've survived, we haven't disappeared in -- in the general population. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And I think the Orthodox Jews deserve most of the credit for that, during long periods when the -- that was the only f-faith. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And they went through a heck of a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I'm not observant, I -- but I -- I feel very strongly my identification. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I'm proud of it and my kids -- well I -- I mean my grandchildren got Bar Mitzvahed, my son celeb-celebrates the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="1766">My two  7 daughters certainly are very clear in their identification. </sentence><sentence id="1767">My oldest son is just a wandering minstrel type. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I mean he doesn't really have any identification, but -- and -- and -- I think it's -- I mean we -- we could have done with fewer Holocaust, but it's absolutely remarkable the way this group gets up from the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and continues to battle for it's survival and existence and -- and takes pride in being part of this extraordinary tradition. </sentence><sentence id="1769">It would have been much easier to disappear and fewer people would have died. </sentence><sentence id="1770">But I think the world would be a lot poorer if there were no Jews left. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1800">A: First "m -- you know, I'm very pleased that you are doing what you're doing. </sentence><sentence id="1801">I -- I mean, too many things of historical significance get lost and certainly the personal experiences of people like myself get lost. </sentence><sentence id="1802">And I've done a -- a certain amount of memoir keeping, but it -- it's -- it's inadequate coverag -- I'm trying to cover my whole life and there a whole lot of people who -- whose experiences may be lost. </sentence><sentence id="1803">I -- I was thinking of the -- the people in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they -- are they -- is there still a <span class="building">Jewish community</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1804">I guess there is. </sentence><sentence id="1805">The current leaders -- but I'1l -- Ill always remember that experience. </sentence><sentence id="1806">I'm lucky to have had these experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1814">Q: The only other thing I can think of is that earlier you said that when you came back from Europe, you were -- I don't know if obsessed is the right word, but -- but this was all you could think about -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1818">Q: -- and talk about. </sentence><sentence id="1819">Maybe you can elaborate on -- on that impact, cause that seems pretty [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1822">A: Yeah, I got sort of diverted. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I -- I remember aw -- aw -- I mean I had these non-Jewish friends, close friends, I -- roommates and whatnot, in -- in the <span class="building">War Labor Board</span> and I'm ca -- I came back in early "51, to <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, to -- and I -- I mean those friends included  8 Walter Philips, who was the <span class="populated place">city</span>'s Commissioner of Commerce and City Representative under Mayor Joe Clark. </sentence><sentence id="1824">And Scotty Crawford, who was a roommate of mine in the War Labor Board days and they wanted to know what had happened to me while I was away and I remember feeling I was more than happy to tell them about my experiences, but I do remember feeling great anger at the <span class="region">outside world</span> at what had been done to my co- religionist fellow Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1825">The -- the killing of children, it was just something I could not get over. </sentence><sentence id="1826">And so, for a long time after I came back, I -- I had this sort of can -- this reawakened sense of identification. </sentence><sentence id="1827">I've never been very religious. </sentence><sentence id="1828">We've always observed the high holidays and that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="1829">And I've -- th-the children involved in -- made aware of the fact that they are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1830">And that's -- that's my life today, I -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
