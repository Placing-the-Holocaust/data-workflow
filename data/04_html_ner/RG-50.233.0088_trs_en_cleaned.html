<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="4">On my birth certificate also there's a swastika. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father said because of the situation we couldn't afford it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Was he able to continue practicing medicine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well that's an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn't do very much. </sentence><sentence id="16">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better. </sentence><sentence id="17">So we stayed in <span class="country">Germany</span> until 1939 which isn't to say that we didn't want to leave earlier. </sentence><sentence id="18">After Kristallnacht I don't think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">I wouldn't say the fate of all Jews because it wasn't known at that time. </sentence><sentence id="20">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in <span class="populated place">Essen</span> alone with my grandfather, my father's father, while they were getting ready in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, they bought all this <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="21">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in <span class="populated place">Essen</span> or my grandparents in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> while they would leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: So your grandfather in <span class="populated place">Essen</span>, would that be on your father's side of the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: One of the stories that is told, that my father told me is that when I was a toddler we were in the <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span> and there were a lot of men with their swastikas and we were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="36">My father was trying to keep a very low profile and me being this curious little kid I started asking all about those signs that I was seeing. </sentence><sentence id="37">In a loud voice Papa [vas iss dos] and my father tried to explain very quietly so that I wouldn't cause a commotion and nobody would notice us. </sentence><sentence id="38">And I said [very indistinct] and I just kept on and on and he wasn't able to let me know enough that I had to keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="39">So finally he took me and we got out of the <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span> because he was afraid that we would get in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="40">My father was also in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">In the early days the Nazis were imprisoning a lot of people and it seems to me from what he told me he was put in because he was vice-president of the B'nai Brith chapter. </sentence><sentence id="42">So they were ransoming until they got all the money he was there. </sentence><sentence id="43">So he was there maybe two days or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="44">But he was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Two days in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: So the fact that he was a war veteran and a physician didn't make any difference? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: At that point it didn't matter anymore. </sentence><sentence id="72">At that point Hitler had taken over the army. </sentence><sentence id="73">And so the army was powerless. </sentence></p></dialogue>
