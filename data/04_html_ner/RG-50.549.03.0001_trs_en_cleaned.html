<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I was elected by the <span class="building">United Nations</span> on March second of 2000. </sentence><sentence id="13">And it's interesting, the -- it's an election both by the <span class="building">security council</span> and the <span class="building">general assembly</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">By both <span class="spatial object">bodies</span>, voting separately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="18">Q: And now you live in <span class="populated place">The Hague</span>, or in [indecipherable] for good? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: Well, until my -- my term is up and -- but it seemed to u -- to my wife and me important that we be here in <span class="populated place">town</span> while the <span class="building">court</span> -- and -- and there is so much business now that one really couldn't afford to be living in the <span class="country">United States</span> and be sitting on this <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">It's basic -- it is a <span class="building">permanent court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">And life in <span class="populated place">The Hague</span> is -- it's new for us, but very exciting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="23"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="24">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="25"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="26"> Interview with Thomas Buergenthal , February 27, 2001 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What -- do you consider this -- this new work, or this job as sort of a crowning continuation of your very distinguished career in international law, and international human rights, or is it also -- or is it a difference -- somewhat different direction? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: In many ways it's -- it's a different direction. </sentence><sentence id="29">I've -- as you know, I -- I was a judge on the <span class="building">inter-American court</span> of human rights. </sentence><sentence id="30">I've also sat on the <span class="building">UN Human Rights Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And thi -- this is very much an strictly <span class="building">international court</span>, but human rights issues can arise, but a lot of other cases come as well. </sentence><sentence id="32">So, f-for an international lawyer like me, this is a <span class="building">dream court</span>, and a dream come true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: Is it in some sense a relief not to be related so closely to very painful experiences, to -- or is it -- what do you mean when you say a dream? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: It's a dream in the sense that I think there isn't an international lawyer who wouldn't want to be on this <span class="building">court</span>, because it is really -- i-it's like being on the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> of the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">This is the <span class="building">court</span> that determines what is and what is not international law. </sentence><sentence id="42">Not that we are that im-important, but in -- in terms of those of us who believe in international law, and -- and practice international law, this is the -- the <span class="populated place">Mecca</span> to which you look. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Is it strange, or is it strangely appropriate that you are now living and working in <span class="country">Europe</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="73">My wife and I have always said that we -- that we could live almost ev - - anyplace, but I -- I think as we get older we probably should be a little more restrictive. </sentence><sentence id="74">But -- but it's certainly a -- a -- one -- one couldn't ask for a more enjoyable environment. </sentence><sentence id="75">We miss our children, we miss our grandchildren, we have eight grandchildren and they keep coming, so that part. </sentence><sentence id="76">But life here, and the <span class="dlf">working environment</span> is certainly wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="77">I miss my students, actually. </sentence><sentence id="78">I don't miss exams, I don't miss that part, but I miss not having classes and seminars. </sentence><sentence id="79">Because this existence here, to some extent is quite lonely. </sentence><sentence id="80">Like many other judicial -- many other <span class="building">courts</span> have this -- judges have that same experience. </sentence><sentence id="81">You work basically by yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: I guess my question was also aimed a little bit at knowing your background, that you originally came from Europe and now that you live in Europe again, did you ever have the desire never to live in Europe again or is it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="94"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="95">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="96"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="97"> Interview with Thomas Buergenthal deg February 27, 2001 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: No, we -- w-we -- I've come back many a time. </sentence><sentence id="99">I didn't think that I was going to live here. </sentence><sentence id="100">I -- I once had a possibility, it looked like a possibility to -- to serve on the <span class="building">European court</span> of human rights, and we debated the issue of whether we would live in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="101">But it never seemed like a difficult choice if one had -- if the -- if what one was asked to do was interesting enough, the -- the <span class="interior space">living environment</span> didn't play that much of a role. </sentence><sentence id="102">But I must say, one couldn't really ask for a nicer place to be than here in the -- in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Now I would like to go back into the past, and I would like to ask you about the -- the time when you came over to <span class="country">America</span>, about the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> trip, what you remember. </sentence><sentence id="109">You were 17 at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Why were you supposed to -- I -- were ev -- was everybody supposed to -- to work there? </sentence><sentence id="141">Was it because you didn't have money for the fare, or wa -- just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: It was strange, we got on the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and people were told they had to scrub the <span class="interior space">decks</span>, paint the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and do all these things. </sentence><sentence id="143">But they needed people who could annou -- make announcements in different languages and so I volunteered for that. </sentence><sentence id="144">That's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Looks like you're a survivor of [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: It -- it was -- it -- well, at least it kept me above <span class="interior space">deck</span>, which -- which was nicer then, because the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="147">One thing that we were all served American food, of course, for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal, these single cereal things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="150">None of us knew what to do with that, and so after we ate breakfast, we hi -- we carry -- walked around with these <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> and thought that that was dessert. </sentence><sentence id="151">That's what I remember from my <span class="spatial object">ship</span> experience. </sentence><sentence id="152">But arriving in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, you know, the -- and we -- We S -- we Sat -- we actually arrived in the evening, so we -- we weren't unloaded, couldn't disembark until the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="153">And to see <span class="populated place">New York</span> with the -- all the lights and everything, was quite -- i-in some ways exciting, in some ways it brought back memories of the past, and I -- "ve often thought about that -- that moment, and it's -- it's further and further away now, I had to reread what I had written at -- at that moment about it. </sentence><sentence id="154">But I think -- when I saw the lights, I thought of the <span class="building">crematories</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="155"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="156">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="157"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158"> Interview with Thomas Buergenthal deg February 27, 2001 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: You -- you did write an article for -- for a -- could you s-say that you wrote an article about a <span class="building">newspaper</span>, or something? </sentence><sentence id="160">Or several people actually put together a <span class="spatial object">newspaper</span>, right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes, wh-what we did on this <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, we put together a newspaper in all the languages that were represented on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, and I think there must have been 37 different languages. </sentence><sentence id="162">Some had to be handwritten because there were no -- no <span class="spatial object">typewriters</span> in those languages. </sentence><sentence id="163">I -- I wrote it in German. </sentence></p></dialogue>

of that. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And the issue at that point was debated whether to have a <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> or

five years there were more than eight million people that had come to the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1535">So I think it's had a tremendous impact. </sentence><sentence id="1536">That Committee on Conscience was something that was very close to my heart, because I feel very strongly that the <span class="building">museum</span> shouldn't be just
