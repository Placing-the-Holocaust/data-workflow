<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: That was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: That was in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, right. </sentence><sentence id="153">Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found my brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="154">However, I looked for him, and I couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="155">Neither did I find <span class="populated place">Aroush</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">And Aroush -- I remember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="157">We were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated. </sentence><sentence id="158">Now we -- I mentioned that Dave was in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> when I was in my quest to look for Lolec and Aroush, I went to <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">In <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>, I worked afterwards in a -- in a dep -- ina This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="160">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="161"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 8 place where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W- A, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food. </sentence><sentence id="162">So I worked there for a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia. </sentence><sentence id="163">He was working for <span class="building">UNRRA</span>, and he was visiting the <span class="building">distribution centers</span>, so I have a picture of him, and -- and when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the unbelief in his face. </sentence><sentence id="164">He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very unpleasantly impressed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So, he had only limited information of what -- what had happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face that he just couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="181">I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he has to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so many people. </sentence><sentence id="182">And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now, as the time passes by, to tell you the truth, it's much more for me to comprehend how all this was possible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let's say, of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="184">And now, when I was making that tape, I didn't mention that a person whom I approach to ask for my mother, going on my side of the <span class="dlf">line</span>, which meant work, I didn't realize then that it meant life, it was Mengele, and the -- in my husband's ta -- tape, it's mentioned that it was Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="185">Now, we are in <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="186">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="187">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="188"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="189"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Wh-Why was it -- why was it that you went in your search for your family to <span class="populated place">Hanover</span>, because there are -- were more resources to find -- wa -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet. </sentence><sentence id="192">You know, it was just by talking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really up, but it -- all the search which I made, was in vain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: What -- what time was that now? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it's mentioned the tape, we had a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> in our <span class="interior

if we wouldn't have gone to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would we get food? </sentence><sentence id="1420">And of course, we didn't know, because there were actually <span class="dlf">graves</span> prepared for the people who were designated to clean the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>.

</sentence><sentence id="1430">And, so it's a great pain that he didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman, never complained either. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And -- and w-which other memories? </sentence><sentence id="1433">Course I remember, yeah, there was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes, and the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to stop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs.Cohen. </sentence><sentence id="1434">She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me. </sentence><sentence id="1435">She was very often whipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection even with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I can stretch better, really, as time progresses. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I became stronger, emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So, when these memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because there is still so much I have to do right now. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And the -- for instance, I learned yoga actually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from <span class="country">India</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And then for about 20 years, I couldn't do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which didn't nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Now, when my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1441">Then she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein from <span class="populated place">New York</span>, which was called networking, which is actually they just touch certain points, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but I'll tell you anyhow about it. </sentence><sentence id="1442">One time, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1443">It

id="1445">And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it's getting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started doing yoga. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And actually my yoga is improving as | -- I don't know whether I mentioned it before. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me awfully good feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which stretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And I guess also the nutrition which I practice. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio -- hemiopathy -- homeopathy. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And it was actually discovered in <span class="country">Germany</span>, about more than 200 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And these remedies are also very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Now, in order to know which vitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by chiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing. </sentence><sentence id="1454">The people who do it are kinesthiologists. </sentence><sentence id="1455">That's how they call themself. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Now, one chiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I'm trying to teach others, but I don't know why, I am not successful. </sentence><sentence id="1457">I only was able to teach my grandson. </sentence><sentence id="1458">He just was so impressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such. </sentence><sentence id="1459">If we put into our bodies, whether it's a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is good for us, it strengthens our muscles. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And the opposite if it's not good for us, it weakens our muscles.

the same can be used with the fingers, which I -- which I use, and I'm pretty accurate at it. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Now this was helping me very much with my husband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it's a great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Now, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and he -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a <span class="spatial object">machine</span> which he uses, but where I went to him one time, and I show him that I can do muscle testing, he says, "You don't need to come to me any more." </sentence><sentence id="1469">And I don't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
