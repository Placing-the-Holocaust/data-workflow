<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: How large was the <span class="populated place">town</span> approximately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Twenty, thirty thousand, just about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: So it was a good size <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">It wasn't a small <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: It was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, yeah, but it was a very typical <span class="populated place">shtetl</span> as they call it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Was there a large <span class="building">Jewish community</span> there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes very large and very active, large, I don't know probably several thousand Jews and there was a <span class="building">Jewish day school</span> they called *<span class="populated place">Tarbut</span> and there was a society, I guess, the Kahila that governed the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">There were several different <span class="building">synagogues</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">There was a rabbi and that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Were your parents religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: They were traditional but they were quote emancipated unquote. </sentence><sentence id="53">They were not very religious, they were traditional. </sentence><sentence id="54">I knew who I was, I knew my identity. </sentence><sentence id="55">We observed all the holidays and that's another thing I remember. </sentence><sentence id="56">Once before Passover I was given a little Star of David and a gold chain and I lost the Star of David and there were about twenty people at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and this is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was made to crawl on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> to find my little <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span> which they found. </sentence><sentence id="57">But I don't remember going to <span class="building">synagogue</span> every Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="58">No, we didn't do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of <span class="country">Poland</span> by the Germans in 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well before the Germans invaded my <span class="populated place">town</span> the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> took over because <span class="country">Poland</span> was partitioned in two. </sentence><sentence id="69">The <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> became the property of the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and we fell into that category. </sentence><sentence id="70">So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="71">They came in with their <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and with their soldiers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Did they come in on the first or did they come in a few weeks later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="78"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: They came in maybe a week or so later and I remember long, long processions. </sentence><sentence id="80">At that time we lived in a big, big <span class="building">house</span> on the main fashionable <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of <span class="country">Poland</span> trying to get away from the Germans and we didn't understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="82">They came in with <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and with soldiers but very little bloodshed. </sentence><sentence id="83">There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal. </sentence><sentence id="84">I personally did not realize what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="85">I knew there was a change of government. </sentence><sentence id="86">The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became <span class="country">Russian</span> instead of Polish. </sentence><sentence id="87">But again that was not much of a problem because in our <span class="region">area</span> everyone was either bi or tri-lingual. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was a little difficult in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="89">A lot of people lost their jobs and all. </sentence><sentence id="90">My father did not. </sentence><sentence id="91">They kept him on and he continued in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">There was one change which I just realized a few days ago. </sentence><sentence id="93">He used to also teach in <span class="populated place">Kracow</span>, I don't what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped. </sentence><sentence id="94">Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over. </sentence><sentence id="95">But other than that our life did not change that much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: You stayed in the same <span class="building">house</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: We stayed in the same <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">You see we were not materialistically, we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the intellectual group in the <span class="populated place">town</span> so our life has not changed much. </sentence><sentence id="117">This went on for not quite two years. </sentence><sentence id="118">Our <span class="building">schools</span> didn't lose a beat. </sentence><sentence id="119">The only thing is that the official language changed into <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Were you taught Russian in the <span class="building">schools</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: And were the <span class="building">businesses</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span> nationalized, that kind of thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Well you know what was happening and again this is all in retrospect which I didn't realize. </sentence><sentence id="132">Some people would disappear in the middle of the night and not be heard from again. </sentence><sentence id="133">And these were probably the people that they considered capitalists. </sentence><sentence id="134">These were business people who owned <span class="building">businesses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">Yes, I guess the <span class="building">businesses</span> changed hands so to speak and all of a sudden there was a shortage of one item, two items, three items. </sentence><sentence id="136">Yes, definitely, the whole picture of the <span class="populated place">town</span> did change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Can I back up just a little bit before the invasion? </sentence><sentence id="144">Do you remember your father, your family in general being concerned about the Germans coming to power, the Nazis coming to power and becoming more powerful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="148">This was not discussed in front of me but I know my father had a fantastic <span class="interior space">library</span> in his little <span class="interior space">office</span> in our <span class="building">house</span> and now and again they would have meetings and they closed the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">A lot of people would come, a lot of his students and they would talk and then I would never see them again. </sentence><sentence id="150">And then I found that a lot of them emigrated in a clandestine way illegally. </sentence><sentence id="151">And a lot of them ended up, many as a matter of fact, ended up in what is now <span class="country">Israel</span> and some of them ended up in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">And some of them we never heard of again. </sentence><sentence id="153">But yes, there were many discussions and there were concerns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Now you said something about earlier when we spoke about trying to get out and go to the <span class="country">United States</span> your father..... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="163"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="164">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="165"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Yes, my father..... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: When did he try to do this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Well, it seems like all my life there was talk about it but I know that at one point, I don't know exactly, I think it was 1938, we all had to go to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and be interviewed or something and this was part of the process of getting ready to emigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: But the papers just didn't come through before the invasion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: I don't know what happened but apparently so, unfortunately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Was there anything, you know you talked about your life under the Soviets when they came in, I there anything else that strikes you about the Soviet rule about anything that you could remember that was very striking to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, I guess going to <span class="building">synagogue</span> was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent. </sentence><sentence id="179">It didn't affect any of my immediate friends so I am very hazy about it and I know that it was difficult and I know that they probably nationalized the <span class="building">businesses</span> and all but from my own personal point of view I cannot relate to it too much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: You made mention about the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">Was there a conscious effort by the authorities to discourage religious practices? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: I don't know, I'm sure it was but it was done in a very subtle way and I think my father was conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that he is not supposed to go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> too often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: You said he was allowed to go to <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">Do you remember if he was allowed to travel freely in that way back or forth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but I don't think we traveled anyplace else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Why don't you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Well, that happened in the summer of "41. </sentence><sentence id="197">Again I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he started pursuing his evil plans by occupying the <span class="region">territories</span> first of <span class="country">Poland</span> and then going on to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">The Germans came, again it's almost like out of nowhere, again with <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp. </sentence><sentence id="199">To me it was an event of change, but in a way exciting. </sentence><sentence id="200">It's hard to say that but it was. </sentence><sentence id="201">They came in and we didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="202">I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings with us openly. </sentence><sentence id="203">Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="204">Why we didn't do it, I don't know. "" </sentence><sentence id="205">m sure it's very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you're on your own. </sentence><sentence id="206">I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn't go to <span class="country">America</span> for two reasons and this is my conjecture. </sentence><sentence id="207">One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father's heart really didn't belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then. </sentence><sentence id="208">They went to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="210">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="211"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Do you think he was advocating for many of them to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Oh, I know he did because we made a trip to <span class="country">Israel</span> in 1985 (decade is unclear) or so and I met some of his students. </sentence><sentence id="231">They organized an evening to honor the memory of my parents, especially my father, their mentor, and they told me that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Did they remember you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Yes, they remembered me as a little pain in the neck. </sentence><sentence id="237">Yes, they did. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I remembered some of them. </sentence><sentence id="239">Yes, my father was really an ardent Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="240">I didn't realize then, I didn't know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Did you know much of his activities in that <span class="dlf">vein</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: No, I know he was preoccupied with education and all. </sentence><sentence id="249">He had a number of doctorates from different places and that was his life. </sentence><sentence id="250">But the rest of it, no, I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="251">He was a wonderful father, he was very stern. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was discipline. </sentence><sentence id="253">We did not speak at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> until he spoke. </sentence><sentence id="254">But that was all right, we didn't know any different so that was okay. </sentence><sentence id="255">I think I digressed from something that you asked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: No, that's okay. </sentence><sentence id="265">We can get back to it. </sentence><sentence id="266">I've got a couple of other questions but I wanted to step back just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="267">I asked you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step back just a little bit if | could. </sentence><sentence id="268">Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans, the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Yes, I think so because there were all sorts of newspapers and the <span class="spatial object">radios</span> and the political situation was discussed constantly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Do you, now this is an interesting question because many people at the time especially historians speculate that some people in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> may not have known or tried to play down the fact that the Germans were going to invade. </sentence><sentence id="277">Do you remember if your father was concerned about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="281">I think he was always concerned with the world situation and they always, I mean at these discussions and these gatherings political situations were always discussed whether it was a concert or poetry reading or so but yes it was always discussed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: When the invasion happened in June of 41 do you remember how long it was after the invasion started that the Germans came into your <span class="populated place">town</span> or arrive in the <span class="region">area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: I would say within a week, not any longer than that. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was no bloodshed or anything. </sentence><sentence id="288">They just came in. </sentence><sentence id="289">In the very beginning, I don't know if it was the same day they marched in or the next day, all the Jews, right away they zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the <span class="building">marketplace</span> and right away they started with their decrees to strip us of all material possessions slowly but very systematically. </sentence><sentence id="290">The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had any material value, carpets, Persian carpets, you wouldn't imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the <span class="building">marketplace</span>, or whatever, I think it was the <span class="building">marketplace</span>, the Germans took that. </sentence><sentence id="291">And that went on for about a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="292">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="293"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection week. </sentence><sentence id="294">Then they went around with a list of people which tells me that the local inhabitants had to give them that list. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Somebody had to give them that list. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="308">They didn't know the names and they went for specific men. </sentence><sentence id="309">These men were all the leaders, the Jewish leaders in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">And of course my father was one of them and they took him away. </sentence><sentence id="311">Just like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: And that was within the first week of them being there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Within the first week or maybe the very beginning of the second week, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="320">There was so much chaos and so much confusion. </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't recall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and that was not even the real nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="322">But that's the way I lost my father. </sentence><sentence id="323">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="324">He saw them; he tried to run out through the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="325">The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">Now I find out that there was a big question mark. </sentence><sentence id="327">Some people told me that it's probable that they were all executed right there and there's supposed to be a <span class="interior space">mass grave</span> which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988. </sentence><sentence id="328">Or some of them did go to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">I searched in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> for any <span class="spatial object">sign</span>, lists and all. </sentence><sentence id="330">I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died. </sentence><sentence id="331">After they took away the leaders of our <span class="populated place">town</span> which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone. </sentence><sentence id="332">Then they, I don't know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our <span class="building">synagogues</span> and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: ...was taken out to watch it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: ..to watch it. </sentence><sentence id="350">They burned all our books of prayer, our Torahs, everything. </sentence><sentence id="351">And they did that in one day. </sentence><sentence id="352">Then we went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">Everyone who was fourteen years or older was ordered to work. </sentence><sentence id="354">In the morning they would gather in a certain place, my sister and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="355">I mean it was such a stupid, useless....most of the work was useless. </sentence><sentence id="356">My mother was digging <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="357">My sister at that point was also digging <span class="dlf">ditches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">Then, after a little while, every day there were different decrees and different orders, loudspeakers. </sentence><sentence id="359">Before the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was organized, one day a <span class="spatial object">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="building">house</span> and several Germans came out and they came up to the <span class="building">house</span> and asked where my father's library was and my father had a rare collection of first edition books and I mean that was his life's hobby (all the little money we had I think he spent on the rare books) and they knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="360">How did they know about it?Somebody told them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: And these were Germans who came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Germans, yes. </sentence><sentence id="377">And they cleaned out his <span class="building">library</span> which was stacked. </sentence><sentence id="378">My father's <span class="building">library</span> was a place where we had to wash our hands to go in. </sentence><sentence id="379">We were not allowed to touch the <span class="spatial object">books</span> without his permission. </sentence><sentence id="380">He really had a fantastic collection. </sentence><sentence id="381">But anyway they took it all, packed it in <span class="spatial object">boxes</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: This was after he had been taken way? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: At this point in time not long after the invasion do you remember if there was a differentiation between what we might call like German soldiers and maybe Nazi troops, that kind of thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="403">Do you remember that at all? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: They were just Germans to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: Do you remember when the Germans actually came into the <span class="populated place">town</span>, were there people who were happy to see them and not just because they were fascists but maybe against the communists or that kind..? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: Oh yes, they were lining the <span class="dlf">streets</span> with flowers and applauding, yes. </sentence><sentence id="417">Then after another few days there was an announcement in the middle of the day. </sentence><sentence id="418">That day nobody went to work because every day my sister and my mother were told to meet at six o'clock in the morning to go to work and they would be herded back in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="419">That day no work. </sentence><sentence id="420">I don't remember but in the morning, maybe ten or eleven o'clock there were loudspeakers going around and announcing the fact that we have to meet in the <span class="building">marketplace</span> within an hour and we can take with us what we want to take, what we can carry with us and that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="421">We grabbed whatever we could. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: And that was in the center of the <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Yes, and there we were marched into a very poor section of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, of the little <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="450">Mostly there were women and older men because the leaders were taken away, about three hundred of them or so. </sentence><sentence id="451">And that's the way the <span

finished off with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and there were two <span class="dlf">gates</span>, one in the front and one in the back. </sentence><sentence id="453">Everyone who entered had to have a written permit. </sentence><sentence id="454">In the morning the people who worked were marched out and they were marched back in in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="455">The place was

</sentence><sentence id="461">The rations were very meager but if on didn't work, there was no ration. </sentence><sentence id="462">So I did not receive a ration and my mother and my sister had to share. </sentence><sentence id="463">I mean they didn't have to but they shared their rations with me. </sentence><sentence id="464">In the beginning people still managed not to give all their material possessions to the Germans so there were some opportunities to barter on the outside and bring in some milk and bread and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="465">And that's the way we survived. </sentence><sentence id="466">My mother and a few other of the women organized a clandestine <span class="building">school</span> for children like myself because we were really left with no supervision and nothing to do and they managed to get some <span class="building">school</span> supplies from the outside by trading rings or gold or whatever people had. </sentence><sentence id="467">So for a while we had a wonderful <span class="building">school</span> in the evening in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">We, I mean kids, really looked forward to it. </sentence><sentence id="469">They read books and we sang songs and we colored and did all sorts of little stupid things just to occupy our minds but it was very good for us. </sentence><sentence id="470">But it did not last very long. </sentence><sentence id="471">After a few months that sort of dissipated and it disappeared because people didn't have any more to trade for supplies plus the fact that winter set in and there was a lot of cold and illness and starvation and mostly everyone was just concentrating on being able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="472">In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> we were ordered to wear a Star of David, a yellow patch, on the front of our clothing and on the back of our clothing. </sentence><sentence id="473">Even within the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> you couldn't move without having that <span class="dlf">patch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">It was a very difficult thing and even as young as I was I realized that we were separated from the rest of humankind because we were different. </sentence><sentence id="475">We were not as good as anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="476">And that's a very demoralizing thing to live with. </sentence><sentence id="477">Most of all I think we were preoccupied with being hungry. </sentence><sentence id="478">Hunger is something very hard to describe. </sentence><sentence id="479">It's so paradoxical now. </sentence><sentence id="480">Everyone is on diets and we say we mustn't eat so much, cholesterol, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="481">But real hunger is so painful. </sentence><sentence id="482">It absorbs or it takes over your entire being. </sentence><sentence id="483">I don't remember what I ate yesterday but those years are etched in my memory. </sentence><sentence id="484">They were indelible. </sentence><sentence id="485">I remember I was so hungry that I would do anything to get something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="486">So many times even though I promised my mother I wouldn't do it, I would sneak out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Did a lot of people do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn't work, there was nothing to do all day long and all you could think of is how hungry you were. </sentence><sentence id="531">And so we did. </sentence><sentence id="532">We had an ingenious, as a matter of fact two places in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where we dug <span class="dlf">holes</span> and camouflaged them and that was not through the <span class="dlf">gates</span> so we would go out, sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and then we'd go back the same way. </sentence><sentence id="533">It was difficult and we were very obvious. </sentence><sentence id="534">We were recognized that we were not the same as the people on the outside because our clothing and we were dirty and we were unkempt and all that but we didn't care, we were so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="535">And some people on the outside, I say the <span class="region">outside</span>, the Ukrainians and the Poles were good to us. </sentence><sentence id="536">Others were not. </sentence><sentence id="537">If you were caught on the outside it was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="538">I did it a lot of times and I was not caught. </sentence><sentence id="539">I'd bring an <span class="building">egg home</span> to share with my family. </sentence><sentence id="540">I would bring a slice of bread or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="541">One time I did go out and I managed to get two eggs for a little ring and I got it out of my clothing and I was getting back and I was almost at the place where I would crawl in the <span class="dlf">hole</span> and get back and this Ukrainian militia man caught me. </sentence><sentence id="542">He started yelling at me and he searched me. </sentence><sentence id="543">I had a <span class="spatial object">dress</span> with puff sleeves and I put one here and one in here. </sentence><sentence id="544">He found the eggs and he threw them on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> and made me kneel down and rub my face in the eggs and screamed at me and said get back where you belong and I don't want to hear from you anymore, I don't want to see you anymore. </sentence><sentence id="545">So I guess he was a gentle person because he could have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="546">He didn't. </sentence><sentence id="547">But I didn't give away the <span class="region">hiding place</span> either. </sentence><sentence id="548">He marched me to the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and pushed me in and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="549">I had scrapes on my face and whatever but that didn't count. </sentence><sentence id="550">A few days later as a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="551">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="552"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection matter of fact a dear friend of mine, she was about eleven a little older than I at that point, and she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she never made it back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and they shot her right on the spot and they dragged her body right into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and they wouldn't allow the burial committee, because they had a committee for that, they wouldn't allow them to bury her for a week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: As a warning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: Yes, there were so many not warnings but I mean sadistic things. </sentence><sentence id="580">One time, I mean I could go on for days, one time there were three fellows who made their way from work, young fellows as a matter of fact, and they tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="581">And they caught them, three young fellows, I knew one of them, I didn't know the other two and they gathered us, the <span class="building">market</span> wasn't part of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and they made us watch when they hung them, three and then they let them hang there for several days. </sentence><sentence id="582">And each day the people who would go out to work had to march around. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="603">Q: They were keeping them busy, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="605">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="606">But my sister managed to get into an old <span class="building">warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="607">These were mostly young women who were knitting and crocheting clothing articles for the soldiers on the front. </sentence><sentence id="608">That was a very good job because it was <span class="interior space">indoors</span> so that was good. </sentence><sentence id="609">But I remember one day she was not feeling well. </sentence><sentence id="610">She couldn't go to work so it was decided that I would take her place. </sentence><sentence id="611">So I took her card. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="621">A: About eleven. </sentence><sentence id="622">But people didn't care as long as I had the papers. </sentence><sentence id="623">All the Jewish people knew but nobody would say anything. </sentence><sentence id="624">So I went there and they showed me where her <span class="spatial object">seat</span> was, the <span class="spatial object">bench</span> and I don't even remember what she was knitting. </sentence><sentence id="625">It wasn't crocheting, it was knitting, a scarf or a sweater. </sentence><sentence id="626">No, it couldn't have been a sweater because I wouldn't know how to do that but a scarf I did know and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="627">And I started knitting and all of a sudden I felt someone was looking at me, watching me and there was this mean looking German going around and just looking. </sentence><sentence id="628">And he stood behind me for a while and observed me and apparently I wasn't doing it fast enough or whatever and he got very angry with me. </sentence><sentence id="629">He started screaming dunner vetter and started cursing. </sentence><sentence id="630">And I didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="631">I kept doing what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="632">Finally I didn't please him obviously. </sentence><sentence id="633">He grabbed the needles out of my hand and stuck one of them in my finger and this is what it is now. </sentence><sentence id="634">I passed out and that was my experience taking my sister's place. </sentence><sentence id="635">In the beginning of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> there was like a little <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">And there was still one doctor left. </sentence><sentence id="637">And I remember his name, Dr. Grossfeld. </sentence><sentence id="638">He tried to do his best to help people but that again didn't last long. </sentence><sentence id="639">Pretty soon there was no more <span class="building">hospital</span>, there were no more supplies and he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="640">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="641"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="642">That's another thing that was happening in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">Every now and then at no specific time for no reason obviously a <span class="spatial object">van</span> would come or a big <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they would grab people just.... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: Indiscriminately, babies, little kids, old people, anybody. </sentence><sentence id="671">They would just grab them, put them in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">And you never heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="673">Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those actions where they would come and just grab people indiscriminately. </sentence><sentence id="674">That's why there was also such a demoralizing feeling. </sentence><sentence id="675">One never knew, I never knew if I would see my mother and my sister again because these actions could occur during work or after work or before work or anytime. </sentence><sentence id="676">And that uncertainty too was very, very difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="684">Q: If you weren't going out and trying to get food or something how did you spend your days in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> while they were at work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="686">A: Just sitting or walking with my friends and talking about food. </sentence><sentence id="687">That was all we talked about. </sentence><sentence id="688">At that point somebody asked me, well didn't you talk about your Dad. </sentence><sentence id="689">He was taken. </sentence><sentence id="690">Well, my mother was really in retrospect when I think of it a phenomenal person. </sentence><sentence id="691">She never let us give up hope. </sentence><sentence id="692">She would always talk about plans -- how we would celebrate when Daddy came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">I didn't think it was that unusual but she turned gray overnight when they took my father away. </sentence><sentence id="694">Overnight. </sentence><sentence id="695">She woke up -- she was completely gray. </sentence><sentence id="696">I guess she knew deep in her soul that my father never would come back. </sentence><sentence id="697">Yet she wouldn't let us give up hope. </sentence><sentence id="698">It was a very difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="699">But again when I look at it from today's perspective it wasn't so bad for me because I still had my mother and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="700">At that point their love and our caring for each other compensated for all the physical atrocities, and they were atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="701">We were cold; we were hungry; we were not well; we were uncertain of out tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="702">It was almost as if you lived in suspension from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="703">And that's the way we coped. </sentence><sentence id="704">It was really terrible when you think of coming from a fairly advanced civilized life to living in one <span class="interior space">room</span> with three other families, sharing the whole <span class="building">house</span>, that was a big -- I think a <span class="building">three story house</span>, we share one <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and one <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> for the entire <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Yes, early spring of 42. </sentence><sentence id="745">We were ordered to move again. </sentence><sentence id="746">Grab what you can whatever you have and meet in the <span class="region">central place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="747">That was not the <span class="building">marketplace</span> but in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="748">What happened was that they decided our numbers had dwindled and they didn't need such a spacious place as we had there and they moved us to a smaller <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and that was really one of the shabbiest parts of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">Nobody lived there for years. </sentence><sentence id="750">However there was one redeeming This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="751">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="752"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection feature in that new <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="753">It was again surrounded by high <span class="dlf">fence</span> and <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and all these goodies. </sentence><sentence id="754">But one side of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was right next to the <span class="env feature">river</span> and our assigned place to live was in the little <span class="building">shack</span> right on the <span class="env feature">river</span> and that was not fenced in. </sentence><sentence id="755">It was really even worse and smaller than the place we lived before but it was on the <span class="env feature">river</span> and it was important to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: Why was that important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: Because it was open and it wasn't guarded. </sentence><sentence id="772">My mother was rather happy with that. </sentence><sentence id="773">When we moved we were again with different people and again there wasn't enough <span class="interior space">room</span> to sleep us all on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> so we had to build like <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> so there were three in a row stacked up. </sentence><sentence id="774">And then life went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, no newspaper, no mail, we were completely cut off from the world, the people who were going out to work would gather some information, rumors from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="775">Somehow rumors begin to float in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that they were going to kill us all soon. </sentence><sentence id="776">There were also visible signs. </sentence><sentence id="777">There were more Ukrainian militia in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and there were more Germans within the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="778">They would just march around with their high boots, all dressed up and spit when they'd see you and make you walk on the <span class="dlf">road</span> not on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">And then my mother apparently, I don't know if she started earlier, but that's when she shared it with my sister and me, that she started looking for some places where we could hide. </sentence><sentence id="780">For a long time she said she couldn't find, make any connection on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="781">Finally one day in the spring she came back and she was very excited. </sentence><sentence id="782">And she said she found two places. </sentence><sentence id="783">She couldn't find one hiding place for three but she found two. </sentence><sentence id="784">One farmer was willing to take two people, obviously for money and another one was willing to take one. </sentence><sentence id="785">And there was her Solomon's decision -- who will go where. </sentence><sentence id="786">Well my mother decided since my sister was four years older than I she could manage by herself and my mother and I would go to the second place. </sentence><sentence id="787">The farmer who agreed to hide my mother and me was known to us. </sentence><sentence id="788">He was on the other side of the <span class="env feature">river</span> and before the war my mother would get, many times she would get dairy products, milk and cheese and butter from this farmer's place and it sounded very logical to me. </sentence><sentence id="789">How she did connect with them I don't know but she did. </sentence><sentence id="790">She was not happy but she was satisfied that she was able to accomplish that. </sentence><sentence id="791">And we just waited for the time that she would say when we should do it. </sentence><sentence id="792">And that time came in early August. </sentence></p></dialogue>
