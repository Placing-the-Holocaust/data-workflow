<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: It...it was until...until year "45. </sentence><sentence id="519">And uh from the beginning, I was uh (pause) didn't have any special job, just just straightening the uh <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="520">But later on, by sheer incident [NB: accident], they were looking for somebody who would who who could paint uh...who could paint the arbeit..--ph), who was a uh SS man who took uh who took care that people would be working or what kind of recommend they got their kommando and so on. </sentence><sentence id="521">How how would...where they would be working. </sentence><sentence id="522">And uh uh since I was... by sheer incident or luck, I I got some pencil and some piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="523">And I painted the SS man; because he was always riding a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, and I I painted him. </sentence><sentence id="524">This really should have been some gift to him, ona on aa <span class="spatial object">bike</span>...like for children, on a <span class="spatial object">tricycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525">Of course, this was a joke. </sentence><sentence id="526">And if he didn't take it as such, you likely could have been destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="527">And...but luckily, it didn't happen; and uh he was very happy with it, and I got a job in a in a uh <span class="building">barrack</span> where there were painters who had painted. </sentence><sentence id="528">And also they worked in a in a in a <span class="building">building</span> where...where they were making numbers for for prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="529">So the the first thing, for about a week or two weeks, I was making numbers for for prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="530">And these will take quite nice job. </sentence><sentence id="531">Later on, I was uh I was uh replaced by uh by a by a German uh German opera singer from <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="532">His name was Kiep (ph); and because he was German he he got the better kind of a job. </sentence><sentence id="533">But...and I was...but I was told in the evening, if I want to I can come by my free will... can paint still the number. </sentence><sentence id="534">Which was a very good thing to do, because what happened uh--not that every every every haftling or every prisoner had to have...had to have a number--but the number was extremely important because if it was stamped, it was a big number. </sentence><sentence id="535">But you could have a smaller number done by hand, and the smaller numbers meant you became...you were more or less prominent. </sentence><sentence id="536">The SS knew about it, that it is uh that uh something like that exist. </sentence><sentence id="537">But somehow they did let it go, and people were very often treated according to what kind of a number they had. </sentence><sentence id="538">What I did, I used to come then. </sentence><sentence id="539">And in the evening, when I was...after after work, and work and worked there probably two hours. </sentence><sentence id="540">For that, I got more soup. </sentence><sentence id="541">And uh having more soup was a quite...a quite uh, I think, important; because you lived a little bit better. </sentence><sentence id="542">Not only that, you could...that I could uh have twice as much, but I could have...

Uh, I don't know if I should have said, perhaps, that I got uh uh I got a <span class="spatial object">Czech kapo</span> for whom I made a uh number. </sentence><sentence id="576">And he was...he was a communist; and I asked him if I could work for him. </sentence><sentence id="577">And uh the <span class="spatial object">Czech kapo</span> uh was quite good man. </sentence><sentence id="578">He he didn't beat his people, and uh it it did. </sentence><sentence id="579">And I got...he got the first kommando; and the first kommando was divided among people who worked in the in the <span class="building">electro magazine</span>, part of them, and the second part were...were the...the musicians. </sentence><sentence id="580">The musicians were many of outstanding musicians who played all over <span class="country">Europe</span>, but there they were playing only for people who were working in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="581">So they gave their coming in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="582">And since they were quite prominent people--meaning that they had a better clothes a little bit--we had a little bit better clothes just the same as they did. </sentence><sentence id="583">Uh and uh what...what happened was uh many different events did perhaps the kapo in the in the in the <span class="building">Malerei</span> [NB: <span class="building">paintshop</span>, or <span class="building">artists" studio</span>], where they make where they were making the the uh uh (pause) ...the numbers. </sentence><sentence id="584">He was... he was changed from uh...from uh...because he was half Jewish, and they had uh they they were told in the cases they would prefer to be Germans. </sentence><sentence id="585">They would have the possibility to become if they would also; and uh there was not everybody... Uh, no, wanted say that uh it was there was perhaps a <span class="building">bordello</span> in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">I mean, these were the funniest things what what happened too. </sentence><sentence id="587">Not only the horrible things. </sentence><sentence id="588">And then he became a German the next day, for which he could go to the <span class="building">bordello</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">And uh there...there, he told to to the girls there. </sentence><sentence id="590">And he suddenly discovered that she's from the same <span class="populated place">city</span>, and they know each other; and he didn't perform as he should. </sentence><sentence id="591">So the SS man started to scream at him. </sentence><sentence id="592">And uh anyhow nothing happened; but I mean just as a funny thing, what what which were happening there. </sentence><sentence id="593">Uh another thing is, there was even also an opera in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, for... Not for everybody, but more or less for the prominents of the...of the prisoners, and the SS. </sentence><sentence id="594">And the operetta was "Rosamonte." </sentence><sentence id="595">And uh I had another friend who was uh painter, who became also the kapo of the painters. </sentence><sentence id="596">He painted like in... like a magician some pictures; and nobody didn't know what was what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="597">I mean, what was on on on it. </sentence><sentence id="598">And then he turned it around, and he painted the whole thing upside down. </sentence><sentence id="599">And he painted some pictures, you know. </sentence><sentence id="600">Another funny thing was when uh they were uh uh uh... Pardon me...(pause) I wanted to say, there was a dentist and uh he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="601">And one day, there were...there were...there were SS men going with one of those prostitutes, and he had to have his teeth uh redone or something. </sentence><sentence id="602">He had to... Anyhow, he was sitting there; and the prisoner told him--the SS man--he should open his mouth, which he did, and keep it like that. </sentence><sentence id="603">The girl was in the...in the other <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="604">And uh so they...so the <span class="spatial object">haftling</span> went to to to the girl. </sentence><sentence id="605">They had their business done, and the SS man was still sitting there with with his mouth open. </sentence><sentence id="606">Another SS man walked by and looked at it, and he started of course to scream. </sentence><sentence id="607">I don't know what really happened to the prisoner, but this was kind of a funny thing what happened. </sentence><sentence id="608">On the other hand, horrible things did...did happen. </sentence><sentence id="609">If somebody did escape, there was uh uh... Did happen a couple of times that people did escape, but very seldom anybody was saved. </sentence><sentence id="610">But anyhow we had to stand for, of course, for hours until the guy was caught. </sentence><sentence id="611">And it took hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="612">Anyhow, they caught the man. </sentence><sentence id="613">And uh all...we we were standing there, and he was he was sitting on the edge of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">They poured cold water on him. </sentence><sentence id="615">And it was, you know, in January. </sentence><sentence id="616">You can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="617">He didn't last too long, but he he froze to death. </sentence><sentence id="618">And the all...all kommandos, all the haftlings had to walk in front of him and uh see the the...how how horrible the end is for anybody who tries...who tries to to escape. </sentence><sentence id="619">And there were various people who did try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="620">And I think some did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="669">Q: Well, as we speak of escape, perhaps you can recall how you left the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, <span class="populated place">Buna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="670">And how you eventually found your way to freedom. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: Uh to get out of <span class="populated place">Buna</span>, uh this was uh on the 18th of January. </sentence><sentence id="674">It was freezing, and uh the Russians were coming much closer to <span class="populated place">Buna</span> than the Germans expected. </sentence><sentence id="675">They were doomed. </sentence><sentence id="676">And uh actually what happened, my...where I was working in the <span class="building">electro magazine</span>--this was where the Czech kapo existed--uh, the situation was quite good, at least for me. </sentence><sentence id="677">And I could...[ had enough of food that I could uh for for lunch or something, that I could also get couple more uh prisoners who would...who got some soup and so on. </sentence><sentence id="678">Because I was working there in the <span class="building">office</span>, which was uh very uh uh... I mean, it was an excellent job to have under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="679">The only way probably how how I did survive, because I was in the <span class="building">office</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="680">In the <span class="building">office</span>, I could uh uh...1 could quite uh move around. </sentence><sentence id="681">And I also painted some pictures for the uh for the civilians there. </sentence><sentence id="682">Because there were civilians uh and uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q: When the Germans realized that the Russians were getting closer... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: ...what did they do at that point that allowed you to leave <span class="populated place">Buna</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: They...they didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="700">I mean, uh the Germans... they said, "Alright. </sentence><sentence id="701">Pack your things, and let's go!" </sentence><sentence id="702">But because uh, I... had many uh...L...I knew many of the civilians in the... in the...in the job, they called me on the side and they gave me some some bread and some butter and uh uh they gave me goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="703">And this was the only thing they could do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: And then you started to walk... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: And then we started to walk to <span class="populated place">Gleiwitz</span>." </sentence><sentence id="712">The the thing is that generally prisoners had a long coats, which were... | mean, they were very poor quality; uh but the striped coat... But I had only a short one since I didn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="713">And what was prohibited, I had under the uh some uh some pieces of of rags or whatever sewn in the coat. </sentence><sentence id="714">So it was a short one, but it was it was twice as warm as the others. </sentence><sentence id="715">And uh... &gt; Subcamp of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, located in <span class="region">Upper Silesia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: But we had...we had to walk, we had to walk, and... Which was very difficult; because not only that many prisoners couldn't stand it any more and died on the <span class="dlf">road</span> and were shot, but many SS men did the same, too. </sentence><sentence id="731">So it was not only the...it was not only the prisoners who were who were under such a stress. </sentence><sentence id="732">Even the elderly SS couldn't...couldn't...couldn't stand it themselves. </sentence><sentence id="733">We got to <span class="populated place">Gleiwitz</span>, and in ... There was a pandemonium, really; because nobody didn't know what was happening and they did not know whether should people should con...continue with with their <span class="spatial object">kommandos</span> as they were or not. </sentence><sentence id="734">And I...after two days... Well, I was not really deranged...doesn't seem like anybody else decided I had to move, so I did. </sentence><sentence id="735">And moved with them. </sentence><sentence id="736">We got on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="737">And on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we traveled for about ten days. </sentence><sentence id="738">The only thing is uh the bread what I had from the from the people in the uh in the <span class="building">electro magazine</span>, where I used to work; and then what we got on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="739">And on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, we had only some a half of a loaf and some marmalade, and this was it. </sentence><sentence id="740">And the <span class="env feature">water</span>, we didn't get; because it was in January, and what we got was only when the snow was coming down and we we had some uh some water. </sentence><sentence id="741">I was still in a pretty reasonably good shape, because I had some bread and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
