</sentence><sentence id="1072">I hit him once right, and then upper cut his left. </sentence><sentence id="1073">He fell down like a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1074">I felt I have such power because this was death -- life or death. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And I was so angry. </sentence><sentence id="1076">I was said to him, "You dirty pig! </sentence><sentence id="1077">You will get what you deserve! </sentence><sentence id="1078">I could kill you right now," I said, "but I will not do this. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I will not make my hands dirty." </sentence><sentence id="1080">And I turn around and I was going on the <span class="dlf">hill</span>  1 the <span class="dlf">street</span> down. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I was not running. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And then, in the last minute, I start to run away. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And I came to my wife at night. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I was out after 10:00, and she was, "What's happen?" </sentence><sentence id="1085">And I told her the story. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And I was all night staying there. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And next

came, said, "Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1091">No nothing, and nobody." </sentence><sentence id="1092">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1093">You know, quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And in the evening, I was going back to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And when I was jumping through the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, I heard shooting -- [Imitating shooting sound].And I went myself, and then I saw, look what's happen. </sentence><sentence id="1096">There are another like SS man or maybe not SS man, but he was a

</sentence><sentence id="1099">She was still alive, and he was taking off her shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1100">He killed her because he felt she was a Jewish person. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They found her. </sentence><sentence id="1102">Anyway, I went to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And I came to there, and I was there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1104">Then her sister always was with her and counting, and I came back. </sentence><sentence id="1105">I talked to my wife was yet to find a place to hide, because in this place we cannot stay. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I said, "I have to come with my brother, with his fiancee, and my friend and his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Would be about five to seven people." </sentence><sentence id="1108">And so we organized. </sentence><sentence id="1109">She's under -- "The beginning," she said, "it will be very hard." </sentence><sentence id="1110">So I said, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1111">We have to do this." </sentence><sentence id="1112">So she was looking, and she find on the <span class="env feature">hill</span> is like a side <span class="dlf">street</span> on the border of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1113">The name of <span class="dlf">Tatarska (ph) Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And this was like a nice small <span class="building">cottage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And I came with her once there before she made the arrangement. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And I said, "This is perfect for this purpose." </sentence><sentence id="1117">So she make the whole thing legal. </sentence><sentence id="1118">She says she make -- she get the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And when she moved there, I came there with my friend. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And first we were looking around; and I think, "We have to make a <span class="building">bunker</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1121">So under her <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, I cut a piece of <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1122">We start to digging <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">We were digging, and she was taking in the evening in a <span class="spatial object">sack</span> this <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And there was some <span class="env feature">trees</span>, and between them she was putting the, the, you know, the <span class="env feature">soil</span>, so nobody would see the <span class="env feature">soil</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And we make such in that two could stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1126">The <span class="interior space">attic</span> was too open. </sentence><sentence id="1127">And there was like a ladder from the <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1128">There was a <span class="dlf">hole</span> between <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So I was thinking, "Later." </sentence><sentence id="1130">But for first thing, I said, "Instead of sit in the open <span class="interior space">attic</span>, maybe we will be there." </sentence><sentence id="1131">But then came the father of, the father of the girl, and, and came another, my friend. </sentence><sentence id="1132">So was a little more people. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And I...I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I said, "Now we have to go <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> because we cannot be in the <span class="dlf">hole</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1135">So we are, we are sitting in the open <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And then I told to my wife, "Look, maybe we will find an old wood, something that we can call and make a first <span class="dlf">row</span> similar to this round wood." </sentence><sentence id="1137">This would be nothing new. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I said, "We will make a false <span class="dlf">wall</span>, do something." </sentence><sentence id="1139">Was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1140">She was running around many places, and then she find somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And they brought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So they left this. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And she brought this little by little inside. </sentence><sentence id="1144">The neighbors was asking, "What?" </sentence><sentence id="1145">She said, "No, for I like to cut this and cut for wintertime." </sentence><sentence id="1146">So was not for -- not I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1147">Then when she brought the -- we measured everything. </sentence><sentence id="1148">We cut it by little and we make numbers that everything will fit. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Then we have to nail this. </sentence><sentence id="1150">There will be noise. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So I advised my wife  2 make washing, laundry -- everything. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you will put them in <span class="interior space">attic</span>, you will hang them and they will dry. </sentence><sentence id="1153">The, the, you know, the washed <span class="spatial object">laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1154">So that. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the ropes, we know they, they were fast. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Then we put a little also outside, and if you put everything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like is dirt and, and from the spiders. </sentence><sentence id="1157">The -- took from our place they put another place. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Was look exactly like old thing. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And this the, the <span class="interior space">attic</span> was shut in maybe like two <span class="dlf">yards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I make sure of it. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And I make, make the <span class="dlf">roof</span> was going on an angle, so I make a small <span class="dlf">door</span>, so that I can every time open, watch and close right away if somebody will come. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And I was this what I have my curved spine. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if somebody not come. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And it's hard to know. </sentence><sentence id="1165">We were there. </sentence><sentence id="1166">It was very fine. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And then the people that come, little by little, from ghetto-- then my brother and his wife, they came, the last ones. </sentence><sentence id="1168">But so other people, they came little by little. </sentence><sentence id="1169">There was story how they were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1170">But my wife, I think she thought about
