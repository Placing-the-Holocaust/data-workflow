<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after Kristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> and stayed with your sister for about a week, who was living there. </sentence><sentence id="2">What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My family was, my whole family was in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">My brother who had run away from <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> had also come to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, so they were all in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was also in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> and we were living in the same <span class="building">house</span> where we had lived before. </sentence><sentence id="13">We were searching the <span class="building">house</span> and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the whole <span class="building">house</span> in order and we were living there and repairing as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="14">In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: And what were the results of that effort? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no place, we like to help you, but we can't. </sentence><sentence id="22">Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), <span class="region">Saskatchewan</span>, if he could do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="23">This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of Parliament in <span class="country">Canada</span> and find how to get us special permission. </sentence><sentence id="24">And he would then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to <span class="dlf">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">After a few weeks, we got this landing card. </sentence><sentence id="26">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="27">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="28"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Now the question was to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">You needed first of all, permission from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things. </sentence><sentence id="30">But first of all we had to get tickets to go to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which is a <span class="building">shipping company</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they were all booked up for two years. </sentence><sentence id="32">We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> again and <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> had that, <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> had a connection with British Airline, with the British, not airline, with the <span class="dlf">British shipping line</span>, the <span class="dlf">Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(ph) line</span> and he met a man from there and he said he would get us <span class="dlf">passage</span> to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">However, to get there, we needed first to go by <span class="spatial object">ferry boat</span>, from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> to <span class="country">England</span> and from <span class="country">England</span> to <span class="populated place">Southampton</span>, we would take a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">When the <span class="spatial object">landing cart</span> came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="36">But we needed money for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="37">In order to do this, we had to sell our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">Now there was one woman, woman, who the Nazi's  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection right away." </sentence><sentence id="39">So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the <span class="building">train station</span> and the next <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going at 12 at night, so I took that <span class="spatial object">night train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">But it was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">It was what we call a <span class="spatial object">express train</span>, where there is a <span class="interior space">hallway</span> at the side and then there are <span class="interior space">cabins</span> in there. </sentence><sentence id="42">So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, it wasn't my first time in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. </sentence><sentence id="44">I came to the <span class="dlf">Brandenberger(ph) gate</span>, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization, I came to the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, <span class="country">Estonia</span> and <span class="country">Latvia</span>, to the <span class="region">Baltic states</span> and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">Then they would recognize us and they would go there. </sentence><sentence id="46">So the whole day we were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that time, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in <span class="country">Latvia</span>, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and they came out. </sentence><sentence id="47">However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered <span class="country">Estonia</span> and <span class="country">Latvia</span> and <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have. </sentence><sentence id="48">So that was in January. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. </sentence><sentence id="80">First of all, were you at this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="83"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="84">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="85"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="86"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: And in terms of this operation in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, what was this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) <span class="country">Israel</span> and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="92">Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake, because especially the <span class="region">South American countries</span>, <span class="region">Latin American countries</span> were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, "Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out." </sentence><sentence id="93">So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that <span class="building">company</span>, to that <span class="country">country</span> and they were all working together. </sentence><sentence id="94">Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that <span class="country">country</span> because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">But the Nazi's were very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they measured them all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: This organization that you were working with in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, was this in place for years, was this an outgrowth of political organizations you were involved with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. </sentence><sentence id="104">They were more or less a Jewish more,  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="105"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="107">I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. </sentence><sentence id="108">They had such an organization in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) <span class="country">Israel</span> and I joined him. </sentence><sentence id="109">So I was already affiliated with this organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to <span class="country">Israel</span>, mainly at that time, you see and also religiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more religious instead of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was a question of assimilation. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was a question of assimilation, emancipation. </sentence><sentence id="119">That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: And you felt that was important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="127">Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the <span class="building">school</span> days, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to <span class="building">school</span> any more on Shabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation marks, more German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came from a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish  http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="133"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done, because the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had the final solution, you see and they didn't want them to _in there, they said, "The world does not take them, the world does not want them." </sentence><sentence id="135">As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another <span class="country">country</span> was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these people go and go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my organization in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has names, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave them different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. </sentence><sentence id="145">So that's how they were choosing them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: So you helped whoever you could? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Whoever, yeah, . </sentence><sentence id="151"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on this one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them go, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="153">And then I went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">I was still in contact with them afterwards, but this was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that day and made it all final, in one day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Busy day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: So you went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: I went back to <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span> in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="166">My brother who were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> and they had sent him to the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">First he was in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> and from <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, somehow, they arranged with the <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, I don't know who, how, but he was in the <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">So one night, they knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and I looked out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> and I made myself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, "What can I lose?" </sentence><sentence id="169">I go <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, I open up. </sentence><sentence id="170">I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph), his name. </sentence><sentence id="171">I said to them, "Don't you know that he is in the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="172">He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. </sentence><sentence id="173">They came through, they put upside-down the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said, "You should have known that he is in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> in the <span class="building">hospital</span>." </sentence><sentence id="174">He said, "Yeah, excuse me" and they left. </sentence><sentence id="175">But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="176">They could always come in, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179"> middle of the night and knock at the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, we had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, to the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, which was about, by <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="181">So this was 1939, in January. </sentence><sentence id="182">In February, the congregation in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, the Jewish congregation in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no place any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> and they had already left this <span class="building">house</span> in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> congregation. </sentence><sentence id="183">I met him later on in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">But this was a <span class="building">house</span> in the old <span class="populated place">city</span> and there were maybe 20 families living in this <span class="building">house</span> now, besides that's the office of the congregation, was also in this <span class="building">house</span> and we organized it. </sentence><sentence id="185">So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="186">Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I knew a little bit of English, not too much. </sentence><sentence id="187">Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this. </sentence><sentence id="188">Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in Weisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="189">Number four, we wanted to make a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> again because the children did not go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">I can speak about this later. </sentence><sentence id="191">And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> to be a contact , going to  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="192"> Many people in <span class="country">Germany</span>, most people, most Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span>, did not live in the big <span class="populated place">cities</span>, they lived in small <span class="populated place">hamlets</span>, how do you call it, <span class="populated place">villages</span> and they came then to the bigger <span class="populated place">cities</span> to be safer. </sentence><sentence id="193">So they appointed me and I went to the <span class="building">Gestapo</span> and I never knew whether I would come out because ___-- <span class="building">Gestapo</span> was a big <span class="building">building</span> which had no sign outside. </sentence><sentence id="194">You didn't know that it was a <span class="building">Gestapo building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was in a section of <span class="populated place">Bremen</span>, they had and <span class="populated place">Bremen</span> was a <span class="populated place">medieval city</span> and it had a <span class="dlf">trench</span> around it and around the <span class="dlf">trench</span> was a <span class="dlf">street</span> which was called Amvahl(ph), it means ___ in the war, there used to be war in medieval <span class="country">Germany</span>, the <span class="populated place">cities</span> had a <span class="dlf">wall</span> around it and when I came there I had to push a button on top and the <span class="dlf">door</span> would open and I would go in. </sentence><sentence id="196">And when I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence, schweigne(ph), quiet. </sentence><sentence id="197">And then someone would tell me, "Come <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>." </sentence><sentence id="198">I didn't know who it was, but I went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">So I went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, I went into this <span class="building">office</span> and it was all clattered around with all kinds of things and this man was sitting there and his name was Mr. Parchman, | still remember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobody, an illiterate person . </sentence><sentence id="200">And he said to me,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, "I want this person to get out, can you get him out, will you let him out?" </sentence><sentence id="201">And that was the main purpose in the first part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">Sometimes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, "What's he going to do, where's he going to go," so forth. </sentence><sentence id="203">The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was to have permission to make a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, because the children didn't have any more <span class="building">school</span>, they were forbidden to go in <span class="building">German school</span>, even in <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, no <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">So what do we want to teach them in the <span class="building">schools</span>? </sentence><sentence id="205">I want to teach them how to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> as quick as possible, because that's what you want. </sentence><sentence id="206">So what would he teach them? </sentence><sentence id="207">I will teach them English and geography and certain things which they might be able to use after the emigrate and also I will teach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see they have to be strong when they leave. </sentence><sentence id="208">So they went on, they said, "We have no place for German children and besides," says, "when do you want to teach the children?" </sentence><sentence id="209">In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he told me, because then German children are being taught and German children cannot be taught at the same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="210">So I, I negotiated with him for a long time and he didn't want to give us a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> or a place, then I said to him, "What about a place," and I found a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1209">A: No, because I met her when we were still in <span class="country">Germany</span>, she did not remember this, but I did, do. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Because when I was in <span class="country">Germany</span> and I was going to the <span class="building">Wurzberger school</span>, to the <span class="building">seminary</span>, at one time, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the question was, do you want Spanish or French. </sentence><sentence id="1211">The majority wanted Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="1212">After the majority wanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I had had correspondence with <span class="country">Spain</span>, a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course. </sentence><sentence id="1214">So I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in <span class="populated place">Wurzburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And in order to make it applicable and have people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big <span class="interior space">auditorium</span> and she was one of the students there. </sentence><sentence id="1216">She didn't even know that. </sentence><sentence id="1217">And then we met again when we came to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1227">Q: Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from one <span class="region">area</span> in Europe, later marry somebody from that same <span class="region">area of Europe</span> and I'm wondering if there's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was American, or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1229">A: No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who, with whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually, culturally and so forth and when I came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, my wife had an aunt there who knew this This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1230">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1231"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 family, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1232">In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was killed in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so that's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1242">A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is true, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless someone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to <span class="country">Iran</span>, or go to other place and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Also I liked her family and the family gave me some, something, yeah, helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1246">Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being surprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in <span class="country">Europe</span> and they didn't care and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want to spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
