<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Well, when the war broke out -- this was almost the beginning of a <span class="building">school</span> year when the war broke out, and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the Germans entered <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was with my family and I didn't understand what was happening until, until I heard that Jewish males are, are running away towards the <span class="dlf">eastern border</span> and two of my uncles and my father got ready to leave. </sentence><sentence id="55">My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care of the family. </sentence><sentence id="56">They were going to leave, going towards the <span class="region">east</span>, away from the Germans  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and that's when it dawned on me that something is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="57">But the Germans came in and immediate- immediately did not happen anything, like the same week, did not. </sentence><sentence id="58">But in a very short time, things started happening -- for the whole population and not only for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="59">It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="60">Orders came out almost daily: "You mustn't do this, you mustn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="61">You have to give up your <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, your gold, your things. </sentence><sentence id="62">You're not allowed to go here or there." </sentence><sentence id="63">Everyday something new, for the whole population, and it began being really bad for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="64">They were singled out. </sentence><sentence id="65">We had to wear armbands, white armbands with a blue Star of David to identify ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="66"><span class="building">Jewish stores</span> had to be identified. </sentence><sentence id="67">People who lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> used to use their Jewish name in a, in a Polish version, and this was forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="68">You had to show your real Jewish name for easy identification and, therefore, persecution, beatings, and, and sending -- being sent out to, "To work," so they said, and just beatings. </sentence><sentence id="69">And then Jews were not allowed to walk on the on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>, only in the middle of the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">It became worse and worse daily. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: How did it affect you as a little girl? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his <span class="building">house</span> and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family. </sentence><sentence id="93">Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there. </sentence><sentence id="94">We started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children died from hunger or were caught and killed. </sentence><sentence id="95">I never knew what happened, just that they didn't show. </sentence><sentence id="96">But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher, Professor Rozycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody would see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each other, and one day I was on my way and a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> away somebody stopped me and said, "Are you going to <span class="building">Professor Rezycki</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="97">and I didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="98">And they said, "Don't go there." </sentence><sentence id="99">So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the Germans came, raided his <span class="building">house</span>, killed all the males in the family. </sentence><sentence id="100">Even his father-in- law, who was in a <span class="spatial object">wheelchair</span>, was thrown out of the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">I don't remember how I got <span class="building">home</span>, but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a young girl what -- that something is happening. </sentence><sentence id="102">I looked around and people were on the <span class="dlf">street</span> covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread. </sentence><sentence id="103">I was always fed, so I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion. </sentence><sentence id="104">But the, the view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad. </sentence><sentence id="105">I had more time to look around and see it. </sentence><sentence id="106">When I was busy in <span class="building">school</span>, I was busy. </sentence><sentence id="107">We had <span class="spatial object">classes</span> the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy. </sentence><sentence id="108">But then when this was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything. </sentence><sentence id="109">I lost my friends to hunger. </sentence><sentence id="110">I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>, <span class="spatial object">hand carriage</span>, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="111">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="112"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="113">There was a former teacher, Pani? </sentence><sentence id="114">Kaminska, who was our music teacher in <span class="building">school</span> and she tried to form a, a choir under those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="115">It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit, and how people know that when you're learning, when you're "doing," you can, you can withstand hardship. </sentence><sentence id="116">May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to continue. </sentence><sentence id="117">You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your being cold, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="118">And we tried very hard, but it became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="119">It became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="120">Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into certain <span class="dlf">streets</span> or rather remove themselves from certain <span class="dlf">streets</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and there were some <span class="dlf">streets</span> that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were allowed to -- my parents had a <span class="building">store</span> right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, so in order to move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the <span class="building">store</span> and little by little we would carry to the new so-called <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">And one day before we knew it, we woke up and the <span class="dlf">gates</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were closed, everybody trapped. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many people walking in. </sentence><sentence id="124">Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller <span class="region">area</span> and also there were people brought in from other places into <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>, and therefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and there was nothing that anybody can do. </sentence><sentence id="125">Now the Germans daily would go out and catch people in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, take them to what they called the <span class="dlf">Umschlagplatz</span>*, put them in <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and send them out. </sentence><sentence id="126">As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a husband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the Germans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that <span class="building">Umschlagplatz</span> will be treated well and sent to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for the duration of the war. </sentence><sentence id="127">My aunt packed for them their belongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="128">Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people are not being sent to work. </sentence><sentence id="129">And you know, nobody wanted to believe. </sentence><sentence id="130">People were...started jumping off <span class="spatial object">trains</span> if they could. </sentence><sentence id="131">Whether they get shot or not, they tried. </sentence><sentence id="132">And more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to <span class="populated place">camps</span> and never heard from afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="133">To me, it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="134">Nobody told me anything, but I could hear the adults talking among themselves. </sentence><sentence id="135">So it became worse and worse and then after they caught everybody in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, they started clearing out <span class="building">building</span> by <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">They made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched away. </sentence><sentence id="137">They also organized some <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">I remember I -- I was in one. </sentence><sentence id="139">I always looked older than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I worked. </sentence><sentence id="140">This was after they took my parents away. </sentence><sentence id="141"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Back up a little bit and tell us what happened to your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Well, my parents...my parents perished separately. </sentence><sentence id="197">They -- when the Germans organized <span class="building">factories</span>, everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they marched off everybody from the <span class="building">factory</span> and that's how my father got caught. </sentence><sentence id="198">He went to work, never came back. </sentence><sentence id="199">The whole group was marched to <span class="building">Umschlagplatz</span> and sent away. </sentence><sentence id="200">My mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some food for the family and she got caught on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and sent to <span class="building">Umschlagplatz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">Never saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="202">Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after that. </sentence><sentence id="203">And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my aunt, and my aunt's little boy. </sentence><sentence id="204">We were living in <span class="populated place">Muranowska</span>, and one day when the Germans came in to look for us, we had, we had hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="205">We had -- well, I have to go back and describe the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="206">In this <span class="building">building</span>, like in many <span class="building">buildings</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, the <span class="dlf">outside walls</span> are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually underneath a <span class="dlf">window</span> there would be a little <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span> that served as a <span class="spatial object">refrigerator</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="building">buildings</span> were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the <span class="dlf">walls</span> are very wide. </sentence><sentence id="208">We were, we were in such a <span class="building">building</span> and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span> underneath the <span class="dlf">window</span>, and I put a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> in front of it so nobody notices there is a <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">Then there was a <span class="spatial object">folding bed</span> that folded up to look like a <span class="spatial object">table</span> with a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span> inside and my sister went inside, and I folded the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and hide in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>, but by the time all that was done there was no time to go to the <span class="interior space">attic</span>, so I went to the little <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> which had a <span class="spatial object">shelf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Where I sit now across was a <span class="spatial object">shelf</span>, up high, and on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> that they had a <span class="spatial object">ladder</span> standing there for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="212">I jumped on top of the <span class="spatial object">shelf</span> in the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and there was the bulb, the light. </sentence><sentence id="213">I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure that my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. </sentence><sentence id="214">Well, the Germans came in and they found my sister....So that's how I lost my parents and my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: What did you do when the Germans left? </sentence><sentence id="235">They had taken your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="239">We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see through a little <span class="spatial object">ventilator</span> that was in the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard from neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure. </sentence><sentence id="240">Over the years I've been trying to find her. </sentence><sentence id="241">You know, just, just the possibility...right? </sentence><sentence id="242">Nobody told me for sure. </sentence><sentence id="243">So that's how I lost them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: What happened after that incident? </sentence><sentence id="251">Where did you go? </sentence><sentence id="252">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was with him in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> all the time. </sentence><sentence id="257">They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="258">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="259"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection together with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be done and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> somewhere, very inexpensive with one <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle, came out to live in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: How -- can you explain how did they find it? </sentence><sentence id="271">They were not allowed to go out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to labor. </sentence><sentence id="275">There were <span class="building">factories</span> -- there were places where, outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, where Jews were marched to every morning and brought back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> every night, and they worked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you could. </sentence><sentence id="276">I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was watching and for some money would let somebody out. </sentence><sentence id="277">I haven't witnessed it that but just heard. </sentence><sentence id="278">I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people. </sentence><sentence id="279">They were going to, to a <span class="building">factory</span> that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who had a <span class="building">factory</span> of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that they kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to work. </sentence><sentence id="280">They probably switched their <span class="spatial object">chandeliers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">They didn't do <span class="spatial object">chandeliers</span>, only did other things in there, but it was still something. </sentence><sentence id="282">So the groups were coming in and out and he could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife. </sentence><sentence id="283">My uncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia had brothers there who apparently helped them find an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and it was all in Aunt Zosia's name. </sentence><sentence id="284">That's why it was a small <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and they made a <span class="dlf">double wall</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="285">In the little <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> they made a <span class="dlf">double wall</span> and that's where later on my grandmother went out this way into that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">My uncle came to pick them up, and then my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of "39 just before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="287">And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my other aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband and son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle came to take her out, and she refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="288">Apparently, she knew there were rumors, must have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be there and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did not want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="289">Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
