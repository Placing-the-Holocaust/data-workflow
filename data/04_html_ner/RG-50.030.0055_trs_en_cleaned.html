<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="77">And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="78">Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was on a Sunday morning. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for my...for the uniforms of my basketball team. </sentence><sentence id="81">I was about |4years and I was...at 4:00 in the morning when I was extremely tired I went to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">And at 6:00 in the morning, I was woken and told that the <span class="country">Germany</span> invaded <span class="country">Russia</span> and they're going to be in our <span class="populated place">town</span> any day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. </sentence><sentence id="83">So we had a horse and <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="85">And we just started toward <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a day or so to get to a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">I believe that <span class="populated place">town</span> was where my father was born and I think it was named...I'm not really very sure. </sentence><sentence id="88">And that is when the Germans met us and the <span class="dlf">border</span> was closed, and there was no need to go any further. </sentence><sentence id="89">So we walked into the first abandoned <span class="building">home</span> we found, probably was a <span class="building">Jewish home</span>, other people who ran away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. </sentence><sentence id="90">And in the meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the <span class="dlf">doors</span>, vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe. </sentence><sentence id="91">They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="92">So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they asked...uh...what time it was. </sentence><sentence id="93">One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. </sentence><sentence id="94">They said, "Well, give me that watch immediately." </sentence><sentence id="95">And my brother kind of resisted, so when the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. </sentence><sentence id="96">And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang around. </sentence><sentence id="97">There was no use to stay in that little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">We still had our horse, our <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and some of our belongings and we headed back <span class="building">home</span> back to <span class="populated place">Panemon</span>, through <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">On the <span class="dlf">road</span>, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And they just kept us there for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="101">We...we spent a few nights there I believe outside on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, <span class="env feature">sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">It wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="103">It wasn't cold...cold. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was summertime. </sentence><sentence id="105">And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. </sentence><sentence id="106">But after that I remember...1 believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="107">Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the <span class="building">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="country">Lithuanian</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Well, the <span class="dlf">Seventh port</span> was, I believe, an <span class="building">army base</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="145">It may have been some kind of a <span class="dlf">military defense area</span> or something like that, but it was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh...I remember that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my father on my one side, and my mother and I...they took us in another <span class="region">area</span> of the <span class="building">Seventh Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">I was 11 years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="148">And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I...1 remember that right before they took us to the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span>, and the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span> was a similar place as the <span class="building">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, they had given them an order to some of the younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side, and I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or 16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over. </sentence><sentence id="149">I don't know, he probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do 60.And...uh...they didn't let him

to...to...uh...his mother. </sentence><sentence id="152">And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there. </sentence><sentence id="153">All the men were shot, but my father was not there. </sentence><sentence id="154">This is another long story. </sentence><sentence id="155">My father was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. </sentence><sentence id="156">I believe when <span class="country">Lithuania</span> in 1916 or something like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">And while <span class="country">Lithuania</span> was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in certain prominent Close Lithuanian life. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were ...and they were honored many times. </sentence><sentence id="159">My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="160">Uh...So before they told all the youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="161">Every man who was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh., </sentence><sentence id="162">soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of there. </sentence><sentence id="163">And indeed, they did. </sentence><sentence id="164">They took them to a different place, which was called the...the <span class="building">Yellow Prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">They called it the <span class="building">Yellow Prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I know that

the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that <span class="building">prison</span> I remember. </sentence><sentence id="170">And later on when we were released from the <span class="populated place">Ninth Fort</span>, after being there...uh...and..-uh...my father came <span class="building">home</span> one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. </sentence><sentence id="171">He was in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family. </sentence><sentence id="173">He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back." </sentence><sentence id="174">And my father came to visit us. </sentence><sentence id="175">He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="176">She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place. </sentence><sentence id="177">We knew about that. </sentence><sentence id="178">And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were shot. </sentence><sentence id="180">We heard all kinds of stories. </sentence><sentence id="181">Who knows why? </sentence><sentence id="182">But, we really don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="183">We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="184">Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">They...when the orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their <span class="populated place">towns</span>...their <span class="populated place">towns</span> and <span class="building">homes</span> and belongings.
