<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well, uh, I had a reputation as a track athlete from <span class="building">high school</span> and, uh, it was expected that I'd go out for the track team and, uh, so I did. </sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, I ran the first indoor season after my freshman football season. </sentence><sentence id="235">I played freshman football in the fall, which, uh, went right into the track season, <span class="dlf">indoor track</span>, and I used to practice on an outdoor <span class="dlf">board track</span> around the <span class="env feature">snow banks</span> of <span class="populated place">Syracuse</span>, <span class="populated place">New York</span> and, uh, uh, and I was easily the best sprinter in the <span class="building">school</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="236">We had a great quarter-miler at that time, a fellow named Eddie O'Brien, who was the national six-hundred yard champion. </sentence><sentence id="237">He too made the Olympic team in 1936 as a quarter-miler. </sentence><sentence id="238">And, uh, he and I were the two best runners in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">I was a sprinter and he was a middle-distance runner. </sentence><sentence id="240">And so I, uh, competed in the indoor track meets, uh, and I had some fair success. </sentence><sentence id="241">I, uh, won medals in the Melrose Games and the New York AC Meet and the, uh, uh, IC four A's, uh, at the, uh, Knights of Columbus Meet. </sentence><sentence id="242">Uh, I was invited down to run in the <span class="building">Sugar Bowl Track Meet</span>, and, uh, I competed, uh, that freshman year, uh, successfully. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: how did the Olympics come into the picture? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Well, after that, uh, uh, spring season of <span class="dlf">track and field</span> where I ran, uh, inter...intramural competition, and I couldn't compete for the varsity in those years because, uh, uh, freshmen were ineligible for inter-collegiate sports in those years--you had to be in <span class="building">school</span> for your freshmen year and then compete, uh, in varsity sports starting in your sophomore year. </sentence><sentence id="256">So I, uh, uh, I ran on the freshman meets and I won all the meets and I, uh, uh, set track records at <span class="populated place">Syracuse</span> and at <span class="populated place">Cornell</span>, where I ran in the indoor meet and, uh, various places. </sentence><sentence id="257">Uh, outdoors I began to win, uh, uh, more important races like the Metropolitan Senior Championships in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, uh, where I beat a great black sprinter. </sentence><sentence id="258">I beat <span class="populated place">Ben Johnson</span> for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="259">Ben John...not the same Ben Johnson of, uh, the 1988 Olympic games, but, uh, an earlier Ben  Johnson who ran for <span class="country">Columbia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">And he was the world's fastest human indoors. </sentence><sentence id="261">He set a world's record for, uh, sixty yards indoors. </sentence><sentence id="262">I couldn't beat him at sixty, but I did beat him at a hundred. </sentence><sentence id="263">And after I beat him for the Senior Metropolitan Championships in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I realized I had a chance to make the <span class="building">Olympic Team</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">Because Ben was one of the best sprinters in the...in the world, and beating him, uh, made me think that I had a chance for the team. </sentence><sentence id="265">And, uh, having, uh, won that race, I was invited to compete in the, uh, Regional Championships for the final Olympic Trials. </sentence><sentence id="266">The Regional Trials took place up at <span class="populated place">Harvard</span>, uh, and I won up there as well. </sentence><sentence id="267">I beat Johnson again up there, along with, uh, oh, uh, uh, Billy Hopkins of <span class="region">Virginia</span>" and, uh, uh, a fellow named, uh, Edgar Mason of <span class="populated place">Pittsburgh</span>." </sentence><sentence id="268">And, uh, I was the best sprinter in the <span class="populated place">Aast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Jesse Owens won in the <span class="region">Middle West</span>, and, uh, Ralph Metcalfe won in the Far, uh, <span class="region">Middle West</span>, and, uh, Frank Wykoff won on the <span class="region">Pacific coast</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And by qualifying for the final in those regional meets, I qualified for the Olympic Final Trials at <span class="dlf">Randall's Island</span> [<span class="building">Stadium</span>], in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">When they were held, uh, uh, I, uh, finished third in one trial heat to qualify for the final. </sentence><sentence id="272">And then, in the final, I ran ..(laughter), uh, in the final; we drew for <span class="dlf">lanes</span>--they hand out a pill or, uh, uh, round marbles which have numbers on them. </sentence><sentence id="273">And you reach into a <span class="spatial object">box</span> and you pick out the the marble, and that's your <span class="dlf">lane</span> number. </sentence><sentence id="274">And I had <span class="dlf">lane</span> number five; and, uh, as I, with my little trowel, garden trowel, began to dig my <span class="dlf">starting hole</span>.... In those days, you didn't use starting blocks. </sentence><sentence id="275">You used, you dug a <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I looked in <span class="dlf">lane number six</span>, and there was Ralph Metcalfe, the world's fastest human in "33 and "34 and "35. </sentence><sentence id="277">And on my left, was Jesse Owens. </sentence><sentence id="278">So here I was in <span class="dlf">lane number five</span>; and lane number four was Jesse and in <span class="dlf">lane number six</span> was Ralph, which was just as well. </sentence><sentence id="279">And, uh, we raced, and, uh, uh, they won. ( </sentence><sentence id="280">Laughter) I thought I finished third, but, uh, the judges thought otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="281">Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, they gave me fifth, finally. </sentence><sentence id="282">But in films of the race--and there was no photo finish in those years--uh, Bud Greenspan, the <span class="building">Olympic cinema</span> photographer has films of that particular race. </sentence><sentence id="283">And, uh, I clearly finished fourth, but they gave Foy Draper of <span class="region">Southern California</span>" fourth, and me fifth. </sentence><sentence id="284">And I thought I was in a dead heat with Frank Wykoff, who finished third. </sentence><sentence id="285">Uh, as a matter of fact, right after the race, Ted Husing--the great broadcaster--uh, called all the sprinters over, introduced Jesse, interviewed him; interviewed Ralph, who finished second; and then introduced me, Marty Glickman, who finished third, the kid from <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">He said, "Oops, just a moment...uh, they're placing Frank Wykoff third. </sentence><sentence id="287">And here's Frank." </sentence><sentence id="288">And interviewed Frank. " </sentence><sentence id="289">And, uh, now here's Marty. </sentence><sentence id="290">Oops! </sentence><sentence id="291">Just a moment. </sentence><sentence id="292">Uh, they put <span class="building">Foy Draper</span> fourth. </sentence><sentence id="293">And now Marty is fifth." </sentence><sentence id="294">Which was still all right with me, although I was slightly disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="295">I was on the team. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was going to be on the relay team. </sentence><sentence id="297">Uh, Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff were out of <span class="region">Southern California</span>, the <span class="building">University of Southern California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">And their <span class="spatial object">coach</span> was, uh, a power in the <span class="dlf">track world</span>; and I remember his pushing his way in among the officials as they determined the order of the finish. </sentence><sentence id="299">And, uh, where I was originally placed third, uh, suddenly <span class="building">Wykoff</span> was placed third and I was relegated to fourth. </sentence><sentence id="300">William B. Hopkins, from the University of Virginia.2 Edgar D.

A few days before, three days before the, uh, trials in the relay--to keep the three sprinters sharp who had not competed in the one hundred-meter race--as, uh, Owens, Metcalfe and Wykoff had competed; and they finished first, second and fourth. </sentence><sentence id="586">Uh, a Dutchman named Oosendork (ph) from <span class="country">Holland</span> was third, a shoulder ahead of Frank Wykoff. </sentence><sentence id="587">Uh, to keep, uh, Sam and me and Foy Draper sharp, we ran a one hundred-meter run in the <span class="populated place">Olympic Village</span> under race conditions with a German starter.

and in that meeting, the morning of the day we were supposed to run, Sam and I were told, with the others present, that we were going to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph <span class="populated place">Metcalfe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="597">And the reason we were being replaced was that the Germans were hiding their best sprinters and saving them to upset the American team in the four hundred-meter relay. </sentence><sentence id="598">Uh, when I heard that, being a brash eighteen year old, I said, "Hey, Coach, it's not possible. </sentence><sentence id="599">In order to be a world class sprinter, you must run in world-class competition. </sentence><sentence id="600">You can't hide world-class sprinters." </sentence><sentence id="601">Nevertheless, said the two <span class="spatial object">coaches</span>, "there is a strong rumor to that effect and so Jesse and Ralph are going to replace you and Sam." </sentence><sentence id="602">There was no question that Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe were faster than Sam and I, by a <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">Unquestionably. </sentence><sentence id="604">But we had practiced passing the baton for the two weeks we were in <span class="country">Europe</span>, uh, during the course of the games, the four hundred-meter relay coming near, near the end of the <span class="dlf">track</span> competition. </sentence><sentence id="605">We'd practiced passing the baton amongst, uh, uh, Foy Draper, uh, Frank Wykoff, Sam Stoller and myself. </sentence><sentence id="606">And, uh, Jesse and Ralph had not even touched the baton until they ran that afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="607">Jesse said in that meeting, "Coach, I've won my three gold medals: the hundred, the two hundred and the long jump. </sentence><sentence id="608">I've had it. </sentence><sentence id="609">I'm tired. </sentence><sentence id="610">Let Marty and Sam run. </sentence><sentence id="611">They deserve it." </sentence><sentence id="612">And Dean Cromwell, the <span class="region">Southern California</span> coach, pointed his finger at him and said, "You'll do as you're told!" </sentence><sentence id="613">And in those days, Black athletes did as they were told. </sentence><sentence id="614">So did all athletes, for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="615">So Jesse volunteered not to run. </sentence><sentence id="616">I'd always loved the man and respected him throughout my complete association with him; but for that moment...from, from that moment on, I mean, I practically revered the guy, for volunteering not to run. </sentence><sentence id="617">But, uh, the <span class="spatial object">coach</span> said, "Do as you're told." </sentence><sentence id="618">And, uh, the relay was composed of Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, uh, Foy Draper and, uh, Frank Wykoff. </sentence><sentence id="619">Unusual, too, in that they had Jesse Owens leading off. </sentence><sentence id="620">He was not the best starter. </sentence><sentence id="621">And they had Frank Wykoff of <span class="region">Southern California</span> cross the <span class="dlf">finish line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">"Cause he was from <span class="region">Southern California</span>, and he was white. </sentence><sentence id="623">Uh, Foy Draper ran third. </sentence><sentence id="624">Ralph Metcalfe ran second. </sentence><sentence id="625">So the two Black men ran first and second; and by the time Foy Draper got the baton, they were twelve to fifteen yards out in front. </sentence><sentence id="626">In that meeting, being as fresh as I was, I said, "Coach, we won that race, no matter who runs, by fifteen yards." </sentence><sentence id="627">And we did win by fifteen yards. </sentence><sentence id="628">The Germans didn't finish second or third. </sentence><sentence id="629">They finished fourth. </sentence><sentence id="630">They were completely out of it. </sentence><sentence id="631">A fellow named Eric Bochmeyer was their best sprinter. </sentence><sentence id="632">I mentioned that he finished fifth in the final of the one hundred-meter run. </sentence><sentence id="633">In post-Olympic competition, in which I competed, I beat Bochmeyer, and he was the best they had. </sentence><sentence id="634">I also beat Wykoff in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, in a track meet held in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="635">And, uh, I'd beaten <span class="populated place">Draper</span> just a few days previously, anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="636">And so had Sam beaten <span class="populated place">Draper</span>. </sentence><sentence id="637">If Sam, I and Wykoff ran three races, there could be three different winners. </sentence><sentence id="638">We were that close. </sentence><sentence id="639">Uh, we were good. </sentence><sentence id="640">We were world class sprinters. </sentence><sentence id="641">Uh, all three of us could beat Foy, Foy Draper;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="742">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
