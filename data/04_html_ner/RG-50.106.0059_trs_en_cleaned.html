<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: And your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: My mother was also Welsh. </sentence><sentence id="103">Her name was Mary Elizabeth Peugh {ph}. </sentence><sentence id="104">And she was a very good singer. </sentence><sentence id="105">In fact, she and my father met, I think, when -- at a temperance meeting, you know, against drinking, where she was a soloist and he was a speaker. </sentence><sentence id="106">And that was in <span class="country">Wales</span> many, many years ago. </sentence><sentence id="107">And, well, she had a major job, obviously, was bringing up The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="108">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="109">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="110">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.eae rights ee eee RSSRE BPS <span class="env feature">Sea</span> IS: Memorial MussH ase ection eb yal dest aeues: lntgimalien abgubgcess and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 5 a family. </sentence><sentence id="111">She had four children under three, twins and two more right off just after they were married. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then there was a <span class="dlf">gap</span> and then four more, so she was busy. </sentence><sentence id="113">And she was also very active in the life of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: So what was the atmosphere in your <span class="building">home</span> like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Very much family oriented. </sentence><sentence id="137">I want to divert, I think one of the great tragedies of today's life is the fact that so many kids grow up without families. </sentence><sentence id="138">I can't imagine not having grown up in a family, as part of a family. </sentence><sentence id="139">And, obviously, when I was -- by the time was five or six my oldest brothers had already gone off to <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">But we all came back for Christmas, and I can still remember the family gatherings at Christmas and other special occasions. </sentence><sentence id="141">My two sisters ran a <span class="building">private school</span> and two of my brothers also became ministers and the other brother was a businessman and then there was me. </sentence><sentence id="142">And, well, we lived through some difficult times. </sentence><sentence id="143">A minister's salary, I don't know about nowadays, but in those days was not very adequate. </sentence><sentence id="144">And we lived through First, when I was born in 1914, right at the beginning of the First World War, and so my father had to bring up eight children. </sentence><sentence id="145">And so we were all very busy. </sentence><sentence id="146">My sisters realized that being two ladies amongst -- two girls amongst -- with six boys, that unless they put their foot down very early on they would finish up by being kind of housekeepers. </sentence><sentence id="147">So we all had duties, somebody had to do the washing out, somebody else had to clean all the shoes, somebody else had to make the <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">And we were a fairly close-knit family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: And did you have chores also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Oh, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="179">You have to wash up. </sentence><sentence id="180">They say that the male members of my generation of our family were marvelous husbands because they all had this training from their sisters. </sentence><sentence id="181">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="182">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="183">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="184">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.eae rights ee eee RSSRE BPS <span class="env feature">Sea</span> IS: Memorial MussH ase ection eb yal dest aeues: lntgimalien abgubgcess and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="206">It was a -- it was a very good experience, one I wouldn't have missed. </sentence><sentence id="207">It was a very tough experience because when you are at a <span class="building">boarding school</span> away from your parents, a long way away from your parents, <span class="building">school</span> discipline is quite tough, but as I say, I wouldn't have missed it. </sentence><sentence id="208">And then I -- when I came back to -- to when I finished <span class="building">school</span>, I went into business and worked for a big international company, Kelly's Directory of Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers of the World. </sentence><sentence id="209">And then I worked for one of the big <span class="building">building societies</span>, I think they are called <span class="building">mortgage and loan societies</span> here. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Oh, I went through -- I graduated from this <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">In those days, going to one of those <span class="building">schools</span> was considered very adequate education. </sentence><sentence id="232">Some of the -- can I stop fora minute? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: About eight years in -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: My last job was in a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Guildford</span> in <span class="populated place">Surrey</span> in <span class="country">England</span>, and it was with the <span class="building">Abbey Road Building Society</span> where I worked as a bookkeeper -- sorry -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: You were about 25 years old then when the war started? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="278">And before the war started I had been involved somewhat with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War. </sentence><sentence id="279">And, in fact, my wife is a Basque from the north of <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="280">When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the British government sent over a mission to bring over children from <span class="country">Spain</span> to <span class="country">England</span> to look after them while the war was going on. </sentence><sentence id="281">The idea was that it would be a temporary arrangement. </sentence><sentence id="282">And with every 40 children they sent one teacher. </sentence><sentence id="283">And they asked various <span class="populated place">cities</span> all over <span class="country">England</span> if they would take one group of these children. </sentence><sentence id="284">And the <span class="populated place">city</span> where I was working, <span class="populated place">Guildford</span>, said they would take a group. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they asked for volunteers, and I volunteered to help prepare the <span class="building">hostel</span> where the kids were going to live. </sentence><sentence id="286">And then later they asked me if I would go and live in the <span class="building">hostel</span>, because there were 40 children and two girls, two teachers, a teacher and a teacher's aid. </sentence><sentence id="287">And there were a lot of chores to do about the <span class="building">house</span>, and they wanted some manpower, so they asked me to go live in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">I went to live in the The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="289">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="290">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="291">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.eae rights ee eee RSSRE BPS <span class="env feature">Sea</span> IS: Memorial MussH ase ection eb yal dest aeues: lntgimalien abgubgcess and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 8 <span class="building">house</span> and went to the <span class="building">office</span> every day as usual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Now, was this your first association with the Quakers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Yeah, uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Had you done other kinds of volunteer -- other volunteer work similar to that </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="327"> previously? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: But that had some special appeal to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Well, I was there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="333">The children came to <span class="populated place">Guildford</span>, and then one of my friends was a Quaker, who was very much involved in developing this project. </sentence><sentence id="334">And he said, you know, we need somebody to help, how about it? </sentence><sentence id="335">And I said, fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: So it was through a friend in large part? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: A friend, yes. </sentence><sentence id="345">So then also I had some kind of sympathy with the Quaker point of view. </sentence><sentence id="346">In fact, I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the <span class="env feature">land</span> when I was called up, and had in the meantime registered with the Quakers as a volunteer for any work they wanted me to do. </sentence><sentence id="347">And in 1944 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Could you -- could we back up? </sentence><sentence id="355">Could you say a little bit more about the working on </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: So you did that in what capacity? </sentence><sentence id="388">Was it a <span class="building">government unit</span> that you were with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Well, no, they gave me so many days to find a job on the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: And I went to one of the local farmers and he looked at me in my <span class="building">office</span> clothes and kind of grinned and he said, well, I disagree with you, but I need -- we need workers, and if you want to come and work for me, you can. </sentence><sentence id="396">But you are going to have to work as a -- just like a laborer. </sentence><sentence id="397">There is no fancy business. </sentence><sentence id="398">And so I did. </sentence><sentence id="399">I worked on the <span class="env feature">land</span> and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: Was that a difficult decision for you to make? </sentence><sentence id="409">To take that course? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: Yeah, because -- because lots of people that I very greatly admired disagreed with me. </sentence><sentence id="413">My own family -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Your family disagreed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: Well, they didn't support me. </sentence><sentence id="419">I mean, my brother-in-law was an officer in the Army and my brothers were both ministers at that time, and so that one of my brothers was working for the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="420">So I was the only one who became a conscientious objector and went to a <span class="building">tribunal</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="421">But the family were very supportive, again, they didn't agree with me, but that didn't affect their affection for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Was there -- did you have anybody or any people who did agree with you and could </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="432"> support you with their agreement? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: Well, of course, a lot of the Quakers were passivists. </sentence><sentence id="434">And on the <span class="env feature">land</span>, I was working on The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="435">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="436">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="437">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.eae rights ee eee RSSRE BPS <span class="env feature">Sea</span> IS: Memorial MussH ase ection eb yal dest aeues: lntgimalien abgubgcess and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 10 this big <span class="dlf">farm</span> and there were quite a lot of other conscientious objectors all working on the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">And so that, well, you weren't entirely alone. </sentence><sentence id="439">On the other hand, there were a lot of people who very vehemently disagreed with us and didn't -- didn't bother to hide their feelings. </sentence><sentence id="440">Indeed, when I got married, in those days accommodation was very difficult and you were appointed places to live. </sentence><sentence id="441">That is to say, if you couldn't find a place -- and teachers had a priority. </sentence><sentence id="442">And my wife was teaching in the <span class="building">nursery school</span> for little children, so she had a priority and she got a place, found a place. </sentence><sentence id="443">But when we went there, the landlady said -- looked at me and said I understand you are a conscientious objector, and I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="444">And she said, well, you're not going to live in my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="445">And so we had to go find somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="446">But -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="476">Not a lot, but enough to make you realize that you were in an awkward position. </sentence><sentence id="477">And it was a difficult -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: Excuse me -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: It was an awkward situation, after all. </sentence><sentence id="485">It was what everybody felt was a very just war. </sentence><sentence id="486">I felt the cause was just, I just didn't believe that war would ever answer it. </sentence><sentence id="487">And so that you are living in -- <span class="country">England</span> was in a pretty rough position from the beginning, the first few years. </sentence><sentence id="488">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="489">We had all sorts of, you know, military preparations fora possible invasion going on, so that kind of mindset. </sentence><sentence id="490">But I just went out and worked and did my job on the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">And in the meantime I had, as I said, registered with the Quakers that I was on their list of potential volunteers. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: The mission for the children was arranged by the Basque government, and in conjunction with and in response to this invitation from <span class="country">England</span> they would take these children. </sentence><sentence id="575">And so Juanita was just finishing her career, her education as a teacher, and so she volunteered to come with the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="628">Q: What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: It was wonderful, because they did everything -- their objective was not to make you into a highly-skilled technician or anything like that, but to make you into a person who could cope with things without the usual facilities. </sentence><sentence id="631">So, I mean, they had the -- in the team there were social workers and people like that. </sentence><sentence id="632">But the training was more to teach you how to cope with new situations. </sentence><sentence id="633">So they had a lot of, kind of, make-believe. </sentence><sentence id="634">We lived in a big <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="populated place">Hampstead</span> and they would -- one day they would decide that this <span class="building">house</span> was a <span class="building">refugee center</span> and that thousands of refugees were coming out of <span class="country">Germany</span> and they had to be taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="635">So half the team would be the people looking after the <span class="building">house</span> and the other half of the team would be the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="636">And they were instructed to behave like people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken. </sentence><sentence id="637">And our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it was really very useful. </sentence><sentence id="638">Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there is no -- the <span class="building">house</span> is being destroyed and so we have got to make do. </sentence><sentence id="639">And so we were shoved out in the <span class="interior space">garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="640">And in the <span class="interior space">garden</span> there were just a few vegetables that have to be in the <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and we were told to find a way of keeping ourselves alive for the day. </sentence><sentence id="641">We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> because there were no <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="642">And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things that you had never done before, and not running away from the job. </sentence><sentence id="643">And that certainly was very useful. </sentence><sentence id="644">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="645">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="646">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="647">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.eae rights ee eee RSSRE BPS <span class="env feature">Sea</span> IS: Memorial MussH ase ection eb yal dest aeues: lntgimalien abgubgcess and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 14 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="690">Q: So you started together from the beginning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: Yeah, we started together as kind of a miscellaneous group, but then they gradually selected the people that were going to be on the team. </sentence><sentence id="693">And then we went on training as a team and we were supposed to go to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="698">Q: Before we do that, as part of the training was religion a big part or any part of the </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="700"> training? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Quaker -- Quaker practices were part of the training. </sentence><sentence id="702">We went -- in our team, I think there were only two Quakers, people who were -- people who were members of a <span class="building">Friends Meeting</span>. </sentence><sentence id="703">The rest of us were Baptists, Congregationalists, Jews and -- but we did have -- we started all our like team meetings, discussion groups, with a fairly long period of silence, which is, you know, the way the Quakers generally prepare themselves for -- in their <span class="building">religious service</span>. </sentence><sentence id="704">So we were very much aware that we represented the Quakers and that we would be expected to behave like -- carry out the principles of the Friends. </sentence><sentence id="705">And this did -- this was an important factor because subsequently when we were working in <span class="country">Germany</span> under the -- while the war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would think would be the appropriate thing to do weren't quite the same. </sentence><sentence id="706">And so we had to face up to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="866">Q: Hugh Jenkins, tape one, side B. You were saying that you arrived in <span class="populated place">Belson</span> on April -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="868">A: Sunday, April the 22nd. </sentence><sentence id="869">The <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I think, was -- had been found just about a week before. </sentence><sentence id="870">And that's the day -- I arrived in <span class="populated place">Belson</span> on Saturday, on Saturday evening. </sentence><sentence id="871">And then on Sunday, when we got ourselves a place to park ourselves, I went into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> on Sunday, the 21st -- the 22nd to Camp No. </sentence><sentence id="872">211, which was the place where they had kept all the children. </sentence><sentence id="873">One of the magnificent things about the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was the fact that -- well, let me go back a bit. </sentence><sentence id="874">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was in terrible state because it had, by lack of concern and so forth, it had been allowed to get into a horrible condition. </sentence><sentence id="875">It was originally a <span class="populated place">camp</span> for about 3,000 people and there were about 50,000 people in there. </sentence><sentence id="876">There were, I think, 600 people in a <span class="building">hut</span> that was designed for 50 and they were layered. </sentence><sentence id="877">But despite that, and then as the last days before the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was overtaken, everything broke down, food, no food supply, no water supply. </sentence><sentence id="878">And -- but despite that, the people had put the children -- the inmates, not the -- the authorities, had put the children all into one <span class="building">barrack</span> where they could look after them specially. </sentence><sentence id="879">And whereas in those last days it was a kind of every man for himself as far as food was concerned, they made sure that the children were looked after as best as they could in those terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="880">And my first job was to drive an <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> down into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and start getting the children out. </sentence><sentence id="881">The arrangement was that about three miles up the <span class="dlf">road</span> from the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, there was a big <span class="building">German Army establishment</span> which, of course, was empty and -- but it had big <span class="building">concrete buildings</span>, you know, <span class="building">barracks</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="882">So that was made into a <span class="building">reception center</span>. </sentence><sentence id="883">And the -- between the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and the <span class="populated place">new camp</span>, there was what was known as a kind of <span class="spatial object">human laundry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="884">And we had -- the <span class="spatial object">ambulances</span> were divided into two groups.

a <span class="building">stable</span>. </sentence><sentence id="889">But there they had set up a whole -- an arrangement for disinfecting and cleaning people up and so on. </sentence><sentence id="890">And then the other side of this place there were clean <span class="spatial object">ambulances</span> which were going from the -- from this place to the new -- to the new <span class="building">establishment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="891">So that there was a kind of an insulation between the diseases and the lice and everything that the people, that the <span class="populated place">camp</span> inmates had, that were all washed off and disinfected and stripped of their clothing and wrapped in a clean blanket. </sentence><sentence id="892">And then the other end of the -- the other side of the <span class="building">building</span>, they would be loaded into another <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> which took them to the -- to this new <span class="building">establishment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="893">So you had one series of <span class="spatial object">ambulances</span> going between the <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="961">And so that was my first job, going in and helping get these children out of the -- out of the -- then because I was the truck driver in charge of the big <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="962">Well, one of the things, when we first arrived there, the authorities would not allow the girls, the female members of the team to enter the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="963">There were seven girls and five men. </sentence><sentence id="964">But the men were all assigned to work in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and the girls were all assigned to work in the new, you know, <span class="building">reception center</span> in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1753">A: No, except a sense of desolation when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the Second World War didn't solve problems. </sentence><sentence id="1754">There are just as many problems in <span class="country">Europe</span>, people fighting each other. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So, obviously, there must be some other way. </sentence><sentence id="1756">But whatever the way was, it was too late to save all the people who were victims of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1757">But that may be rationalizing it, but, no, I still think, I still believe that war is not -- never will be an answer to our problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
