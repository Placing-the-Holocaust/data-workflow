<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="323">And that was the point at which our parents told us that we were -- no they didn't even tell us we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="324">That came later. </sentence><sentence id="325">No they just told us we had to move <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: But how did the authorities know. </sentence><sentence id="330">I just know if you ever asked your parents later why they then considered you Jewish in the sense that they didn't bring you up that way. </sentence><sentence id="331">You were christened. </sentence><sentence id="332">Why did they follow that edict if you were Christian? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: Do you know how they, I know this is they're telling you the story but how did they say that they knew that they didn't have a choice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Well I think you know my father in his job was well known as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="342">With a name like <span class="populated place">Friedenthal</span> you couldn't be anything else. </sentence><sentence id="343">And so no I mean it was known that they were Jewish by many people and -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="344">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="345"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Openly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Yeah, I don't think it was talked about but and my father had this, this view which I only learned only later but because he was, he had fought in the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="355">He had gotten the what, <span class="spatial object">Iron Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">And he had a high position in a well-known <span class="building">bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">And that nothing would happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="358">And of course initially nothing did. </sentence><sentence id="359">And that was probably because I don't know who the Interior Minister was at the time. </sentence><sentence id="360">But my, again this is something I had learned later was that, that he told Hitler that if he rounded up all the Jews in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> at once, the economy of the <span class="populated place">city</span> would collapse. </sentence><sentence id="361">And so he'd better do it slowly. </sentence><sentence id="362">And I think that gave my father a false sense of safety. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2226">Q: How did they know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2228">A: Well you know there was still communication between, well early on you know my two aunts were still in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and you could still get letters, cards through and I think everybody developed some, a code which made it clear. </sentence><sentence id="2229">So they knew. </sentence><sentence id="2230">And later on, yeah my mother's brother and his family went to <span class="country">Denmark</span> and they got news there quite often and would pass it on to us. </sentence><sentence id="2231">So that was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2245">She was not taken to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2246">But during that whole time I think I just did not want to have anything to do with being Jewish, with knowing about Jews, with anything. </sentence><sentence id="2247">I wanted to be British but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2248">Q: So you graduated in 46 you say or got your certificate? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: I got my <span class="building">school</span> certificate but then I went on to, at that point you can specialize. </sentence><sentence id="2250">You can decide what <span class="region">area</span> you want to do in <span class="building">university</span> and my sister had specialized in romance languages and I was good at those too but I decided that I didn't want to do the same thing she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And I had gotten, I enjoyed being outside and looking at the <span class="env feature">flowers</span> and insects and all those things. </sentence><sentence id="2252">So I decided I'd go into the sciences. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And so that was 45, 46. </sentence><sentence id="2254">46.I switched <span class="building">schools</span> and I went to <span class="populated place">Cambridge</span> to the <span class="building">high school</span>, my sister had been in the <span class="building">Per school</span> which was a very good <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2255">I spent you could spend two years or three years there but I was very young so I actually spent three years. </sentence><sentence id="2256">But also so that I hoped I would be able to get a state scholarship which would pay for everything when I went to <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2257">If I stayed the extra year and got a distinction in the <span class="region">area</span> that I wanted to go into. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And that worked out. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And I didn't apply, I applied to the two <span class="building">women's colleges</span> in <span class="building">Cambridge university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And then I applied to <span class="building">Bedford College</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2261">You didn't apply to many places in those days, very much. </sentence><sentence id="2262">And I got on the waiting list for <span class="populated place">Cambridge</span> and I mean fairly quickly got told that I had gotten in. </sentence><sentence id="2263">So I went to <span class="building">Cambridge University</span> and went to <span class="building">Girton College</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2264">That was great. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And particularly because virtually everything was paid for by the state and got a state scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="2266">Oh yes, but the problem then came. </sentence><sentence id="2267">In 1940, let's see where are we. </sentence><sentence id="2268">In 1948 my father went back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2269">My mother stayed in <span class="country">England</span> in <span class="populated place">St. Albans</span> cause she had gotten herself a job in working on <span class="dlf">interchange</span> with <span class="building">high school</span> German and English students. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And so she loved that job and she loved being independent. </sentence><sentence id="2271">But she stayed basically because I wasn't 18 yet. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And that anyhow didn't help because it turned out that they didn't want to leave me in <span class="country">England</span> without having citizenship because I was going to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Well my sister was there. </sentence><sentence id="2274">And so it turned out that you couldn't apply for citizenship until you were 21. </sentence><sentence id="2275">So then we went through this period where my headmistress, various other people wrote letters for me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2276">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2277"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection saying ok this, this girl is going to be 18 in May. </sentence><sentence id="2278">She will be alone in this <span class="country">country</span> with, her parents will be in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2279">And she will have absolutely no status whatsoever unless she can become a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="2280">And so eventually I became a citizen and when I turned 18. </sentence><sentence id="2281">They agreed that this was reasonable. </sentence><sentence id="2282">And then I applied for scholarships everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2283">And it was very funny because the county of <span class="populated place">Cambridge</span> also provided scholarships with a lot of money if you needed it. </sentence><sentence id="2284">And I was, I think my father said that he could provide 100 pounds a year or something. </sentence><sentence id="2285">And but that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And so I needed my board and <span class="interior space">room</span>, tuition and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And I got a state scholarship which actually paid for everything. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And I got a letter from the <span class="populated place">Cambridge county</span> congratulating me on getting state scholarship and they said and I have to tell you we are particularly grateful because you would have been by far the most expensive student we ever funded. </sentence><sentence id="2289">So which I thought was a very nice letter at the time.

a long time before I felt at all comfortable going there. </sentence><sentence id="2348">And you know the, I mean the Brits and as I say they gave me a wonderful education and I had three great years in <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2349">And I didn't have the problems that actually one of my best friends was Jewish and active in the <span class="building">student

id="2359">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And I was active in the student Christian movement. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And I didn't have the problem that well, I mean I had a slight problem that my sister had with who of course was four years old. </sentence><sentence id="2362">It was worse then. </sentence><sentence id="2363">That she, well I think one boyfriend was particularly bad but that she was I think very fond of. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And he of her. </sentence><sentence id="2365">And I think she said one day you know I'd really like to meet your parents. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And he said, no this is, unfortunately they have a real problem. </sentence><sentence id="2367">I can't take you <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2368">And I think that happened to her a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="2369">To me only once when I had a boyfriend and his, I think his brother came to <span class="populated place">town</span> and sister. </sentence><sentence id="2370">And well sister in law. </sentence><sentence id="2371">And they took us out for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="2372">And they you know it was a perfectly ok dinner but I didn't measure up. </sentence><sentence id="2373">So that was the end of that one. </sentence><sentence id="2374">So it's, I mean I, I think I had a love hate relationship with <span class="country">Great Britain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2375">And one of the conditions of my scholarship was that I had to teach for four years in <span class="building">high school</span> science, after I graduated. </sentence><sentence id="2376">So I spent a year in <span class="populated place">London</span>, getting a teaching diploma which I enjoyed. </sentence><sentence id="2377">And then I taught at <span class="building">Oxford high school</span> for four years. </sentence><sentence id="2378">And I liked teaching. </sentence><sentence id="2379">I still like teaching. </sentence><sentence id="2380">And it wasn't a hardship. </sentence><sentence id="2381">But when the four years were up, I decided that I needed to do something else and I needed to get out of <span class="country">Britain</span> and you know see what else was around to offer. </sentence><sentence id="2382">And I wanted to do graduate work in freshwater biology which I had studied to some extent and taken my senior year students to various what do you call them. </sentence><sentence id="2383"><span class="building">Field stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2384">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2385">And to do work there. </sentence><sentence id="2386">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="2387">So I applied to a number of <span
