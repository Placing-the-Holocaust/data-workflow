</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: I am Leslie Swift, speaking on behalf of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>, on September 20", in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and I am speaking to Benni Korzen. </sentence><sentence id="3">And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember -- I know you were very young at the time that all of this happened. </sentence><sentence id="4">Can you tell me a little bit, if anything, that you remember from before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao -- chaotic and unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been involved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="7">And so at -- at five and a half years, oh you know, I -- you're old enough to know what's going on, and I remember everything that I -- the highlights. </sentence><sentence id="8">But let me just go back and -- and also just explain that I was born in -- in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, and from ninet -- from April -- <span class="country">Denmark</span> was occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>, April of 1940, and for three years, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose -- knows about history, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish population of <span class="country">Denmark</span>, sort of alone. </sentence><sentence id="9">One reason was that the <span class="spatial object">German war machine</span>, you know, took advantage of the fact that in <span class="country">Denmark</span> there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho -- and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="10">So it made sense not to cause any trouble there. </sentence><sentence id="11">Then, something happened in August and September of  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen : September 18, 2015 deg43, as a result of which things changed. </sentence><sentence id="12">And essentially, orders came from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to round up and arrest all -- and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and bring them down to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">Anyway, the -- what -- what happened to me was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not knowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer -- they thought that would be the safer thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="14">And as it turned out, it -- you know, it -- it worked out. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one night somebody came and picked me up and took me acor -- you know, during the middle of the night, and I ended up on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and was sailed across to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, where my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="16">And we then ended up in <span class="populated place">Stockholm</span>, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">There are some details that -- that -- along the way that I think are important to nat -- to -- to know. </sentence><sentence id="18">What happened between 19 -- April "40, and August, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. </sentence><sentence id="19">Then, the -- basically Eichmann decided, and the order came from his <span class="building">office</span> to, you know, not -- no longer, you know, leave the Jews alone. </sentence><sentence id="20">What happened then factually, was that a low ranking -- I think he was a trade attache at the <span class="building">German embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, saw a telefax come in that wi-without any sp -- you know, that -- that gave him the information  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen deg September 18, 2015 that there was a -- a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="21">He decided, without telling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who -- whom he knew was -- wa-was, you know, a person who -- who would take that information. </sentence><sentence id="22">And that person took it to a high ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to happen. </sentence><sentence id="23">And the rabbi -- and the rabbi said, I don't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="24">And there -- th-the reason why he didn't believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had, from the time <span class="country">Denmark</span> was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to, nobody touches anybody, because -- as long as I'm the king. </sentence><sentence id="25">And -- and he would sort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride, through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, whenever he was then saluted by German soldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. </sentence><sentence id="26">And so, for three years -- three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing bad would happen. </sentence><sentence id="27">And that led to the rabbi's reaction. </sentence><sentence id="28">However, wi -- faced with the very sh -- harsh information, he then -- the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a certain sermon -- evening in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, word came out and spread like -- like i-i-instantly. </sentence><sentence id="29">The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">So it was a very easy way to -- through -- not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be reached. </sentence><sentence id="31">And that's -- that's when this come -- sort of chaotic and spontaneous --  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen deg September 18, 2015 well, it was spontaneous and -- but also, surrounded by chaos, because nobody had done anything of this nature before. </sentence><sentence id="33">That a rescue operation that then took ple -- the -- the major numbers of people who -- who were taken over, happened in October of 1943, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: But you didn't go until November, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: I didn't go until November, and stayed with his family, where -- where -- because the family had two daughters my age, I sort of -- I-- I -- as I remember that time, 1-it was an exciting time, because th-th-they -- they treated me as I -- I suddenly became a member of a new family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: And -- and there was a very nice <span class="building">house</span>, and so i-it was -- it was -- you know, I was kept away totally, from the reality of what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="42">So as -- continuing to speak about what you remember from that time, do you remember being taken to the <span class="building">house</span>, or -- I mean, do y -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: No, I remember being then taken from the <span class="building">house</span> in -- it was November 17", and the reason I know that date is that a very nice friend, a journalist, a Danish journ- journalist, dug up information that has to do with when we then -- when all these Danish Jews arrived in <span class="country">Sweden</span>, there was another sort of chaotic -- under the chaos of -- because nobody arrived in -- in -- at given points. </sentence><sentence id="44"> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: The -- the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> that took us over ranged from long <span class="spatial object">boats</span> to, you know, large <span class="spatial object">fishing trawlers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">And they ended up wherever they could. </sentence><sentence id="49">And wherever that happened, the Swedish police took notes, and you know, took the information who -- who -- who had arrived. </sentence><sentence id="50">And so, I have a copy of that, dated November the 18", where I, as a five and a half year old boy, described as -- with, you know, not able to speak Swedish, which I then le -- later learned -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Yeah, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: --cause I went to first grade there. </sentence><sentence id="53">And what I remember is that the night when I was picked up by two very nice people that I had never seen before, one of whom gave me a comic strip, a ba-- a--a-- was a-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: A comic book? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: A comic book. </sentence></p></dialogue>

in a <span class="building">local school</span>, first grade. </sentence><sentence id="85">And you know, that became a -- a new f -- lifestyle, that totally took me into a new world, and therefore, the war had sort of vanished completely from our lives -- from my life. </sentence><sentence id="86">Of course, in the case of my parents it was different, because my father was given the task as a -- as an attorney, to deal with <span class="populated place">settlements</span> by the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, the legal aspects of it. </sentence><sentence

id="96">And what had happened was that in 1940 -- and during the October days, when everybody tried to get across to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, they were captured, along with a group of -- of -- of people. </sentence><sentence id="97">They were -- they had been hiding in a small <span class="populated place">village</span> near the <span class="env feature">coast</span>, where  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 they were hoping to get off to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">And they were then taken down to the <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">And they stayed there until April

what -- what we -- to -- to finish that story, what happened was that the war ended, and May fifth, <span class="country">Denmark</span> was freed, and -- and open again. </sentence><sentence id="111">And very shortly thereafter, we returned from <span class="country">Sweden</span>, to -- to <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">And we found our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> pretty much exactly the way we had left it during those chaotic days, because a neighbor had taken care of it. </sentence><sentence id="113"> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: And can

door neighbor had -- there was a death in the family. </sentence><sentence id="119">An-Anyway, it -- it was a -- i-it -- it -- it was neighbors who took care of it. </sentence><sentence id="120">And I think that my parents were totally, you know, astounded that this -- and of course very happy, and -- and -- and so, in celebration, what they had brought back from <span class="country">Sweden</span> was a certain kind of chocolate that during the -- during the war in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, you know, you can't get chocolate, so what happened was there was a big party, where all the kids in -- in the -- in the <span class="building">complex</span> where we lived, were invited up, and it -- it was a sort of a -- it -- it was a party that took several days, that ended up -- that

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: And when did you come to the <span class="country">U.S.</span>, and how did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: That did not take place until 63. </sentence><sentence id="128">What happened was, before that, in ni -- in 1960, I star -- as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor -- I--I started working f--at a <span class="building">movie company</span> aa -- as a-- you know, a P.A, a production assistant. </sentence><sentence id="129">One day, arrived a crew of five people from <span class="building">CBS</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">They came to <span class="country">Denmark</span> in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="131">And so I was attached -- I--I spoke English, and I was attached to them as their sort of show -- their -- their guide. </sentence><sentence id="132">And what happened was, we went around  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="133"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen deg September 18, 2015 and interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the rescue operation. </sentence><sentence id="134">And a-at some point, we sat in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Elsinore</span>, which is on the coast, five miles across the <span class="env feature">water</span> from <span class="country">Sweden</span>, at the <span class="building">office</span> of a bookbinder, who -- whose last name is Kerr(ph). </sentence><sentence id="135">And he spoke not a word of English, so I not only had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">And that -- it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the information he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in Danish, listen, I'm -- I'm -- I'm busy, I'm a busy guy. </sentence><sentence id="137">Get these damn Americans out, I've had enough of them. </sentence><sentence id="138">Which was a -- which made it slightly tricky for me to translate, and I didn't quite know how to handle that. </sentence><sentence id="139">But I wa -- I was sort of saved by the bell, because in walk -- into his <span class="building">office</span> walked another man and -- and -- who was clearly a -- his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then introduced to all of us. </sentence><sentence id="140">And when it came to me, and -- and he heard my last name, he said, wait a minute, I -- I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="141">Then it turned out that wha -- what unfolded was sort of a-- a -- wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who came in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph) during the transportations, and what then ev -- developed was that it was on Kerr's(ph) <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that I had been taken across. </sentence><sentence id="142">And he was the one who said, if you puke, you go overboard. </sentence><sentence id="143">And so, all of this happened within two minutes. </sentence><sentence id="144">And h--  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen 8 September 18, 2015 and of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and [indecipherable] and -- and lunch, and stayed for hours. </sentence><sentence id="145">And then the next day, that story was then made part of the -- of -- of the documentary. </sentence><sentence id="146">And again, I was, because Kerr(ph) still didn't speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran -- translate everything he said. </sentence><sentence id="147">He then -- his story, as part of -- of -- of the people rescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he continued sailing across, even into 1943 - "44, the spring, in spite of the fact that it got increasingly difficult, because there were more and more <span class="spatial object">patrols boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">And so it was only on nights without any <span class="env feature">moon</span> that -- that he could cross without being seen. </sentence><sentence id="149">And what did help his -- his enterprise was that he went -- he was sort of a--a Scarlet Pimpernel of -- you know, he -- he didn't pay much attention to his own safety. </sentence><sentence id="150">He -- he -- he went from a very small <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, to a f -- pa -- bigger <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and by the time, in November of "43, he had a -- as, under the circumstance, a very fast <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944, and he spent a year in -- in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">He also, obviously, survived, because we had this wonderful lunch and thing in -- in -- in [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: And -- and -- and so, did -- did you talk at all about why he was motivated to do what he did? </sentence><sentence id="154"> ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Yes, we did, and his style was -- he said -- and I translated verbatim, and it ended up in the film, he said, I didn't rescue the Jews, or anybody, because I liked them. </sentence><sentence id="156">I did it because I hated the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="157">That was -- I mean, that -- that -- that was what he said. </sentence><sentence id="158">Obviously, there was more to it, but that was what came out of his mouth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Or he hated fascism, or he hated, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: -- the <span class="building">government</span>, or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's very interesting, and -- so, one question I had, just when reading your story was, when this documentary was made, was it because the Eichmann trial was going on, or was there any relationship to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: [have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, because what also happened was in October -- in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed -- ha-had crossed to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, and so those -- th- the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> then took care of -- had people such as -- on the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> it wa -- it was a-- an RAF pilot who had parachuted over <span class="country">Denmark</span>, and he had to get -- be gotten out. </sentence><sentence id="211">The <span class="building">Royal Air Force</span>, you know, the British air force. </sentence><sentence id="212">And there were some other people. </sentence><sentence id="213">So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the -- the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 <span class="dlf">crossing</span>, I -- I wi-- my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that -- that crossed th-the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">I -- and because it was sort of a--a very -- it was the first time I'd bid -- bid -- been on a -- on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> of that type. </sentence><sentence id="215">It may have been the first time I'd e-e -- been on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, ever. </sentence><sentence id="216">You know, as a five year -- and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and -- and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in -- in -- in October, where s- sometimes young children were a -- you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I guess th-the -- Mr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. </sentence><sentence id="218">I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to -- to, you know, give me an injection to -- for -- for me to keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="219">So, by the time we arrived in -- near <span class="populated place">Helsingborg</span> in <span class="country">Sweden</span>, which is across from the shortest distance from <span class="country">Denmark</span>, I've -- as we moved into the <span class="dlf">harbor</span>, along the -- the side, I-- I saw my father from the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and he was there with -- I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="220">So that's what I do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
