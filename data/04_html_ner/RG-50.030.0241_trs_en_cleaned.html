<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Well my name was Gerd G-E-R-D Sigmund(ph) von <span class="populated place">Halle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">Was born on December 2, 1922, in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I had one brother and his name was Hans Jtirgen(ph), and he was | year and nine months older than I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And what was your father's occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My father's occupation -- he was an architect, specializing in <span class="building">building department stores</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about your childhood while you were in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Well, it was a very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="20">My father was doing rather well as an architect. </sentence><sentence id="21">We lived in a upper middle class neighborhood in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">We went to <span class="building">public schools</span> there, and life was, was pretty nice although I understand when I was a baby, of course -- this was still -- we're talking about 1922, "23, there was, they had it was at the end of World War I and the inflation I understand from my mother that they bought a bottle of milk for a million marks and so on, so times were not that easy when I was a baby, but I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="23">And we went to <span class="building">public school</span>, went to what they call <span class="building">Oberrealschule</span>!, </sentence><sentence id="24">which you would call here a <span class="building">junior high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">And then Hitler well, of course, in 1930 and "31 and "32, Hitler became more popular and things became more difficult for the Jews although I was still a young child and not quite aware of everything that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="26">In 1933, Hitler came to power as Chancellor and then, of course, things changed very dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="27">I still remember being in <span class="building">junior high school</span> as an 11 year old and we had to learn how to give the Hitler salute. </sentence><sentence id="28">So here we were marching around in the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> giving the Hitler salute in the proper fashion. </sentence><sentence id="29">And whenever there was a holiday every <span class="building">house</span> had to display a flag. </sentence><sentence id="30">It was either the swastika flag or the <span class="spatial object">German flag</span> and we didn't display either one of them, but then we were told that we had to and so my father went out and he bought the German flag black, red and gold flag, and so we displayed that on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and my father was very much aware that there was no future for us. </sentence><sentence id="31">So since he had a sister married to a Dutchman in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, he decided to move to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">Furthermore, although we had been thinking in terms of going to <span class="country">America</span>, but <span class="country">America</span> in 1933 wasn't exactly <span class="dlf">streets</span> weren't lined with gold and I think <span class="country">America</span> didn't need a German architect at that particular time, so we moved to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33"><span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> in those days was an absolutely delightful place to live. </sentence><sentence id="34">I would say probably one of the most wonderful times of my life I've spent in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> as a young man. </sentence><sentence id="35">It was a very quiet, easy going lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="36">The Dutch were delightful people. </sentence><sentence id="37">Everything went very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="38">Everything was very neat. </sentence><sentence id="39">Everything was very clean. </sentence><sentence id="40">And so there we, we went to <span class="building">school</span> even though when we arrived there the <span class="building">Dutch schools</span> were way ahead of the <span class="building">German schools</span> and so I was -- and both my brother and I, we were both put back one class so we were put back one grade. </sentence><sentence id="41"><span class="country">Holland</span>, as I said, was, was delightful uneventful to a degree and, and we were not -- and of course, the <span class="env feature">war clouds</span> started gathering in the late "30s. </sentence><sentence id="42">And we were not too much worried about <span class="country">Holland</span> being -- becoming involved in the war because in the last war, that is, World War I, <span class="country">Holland</span> was neutral. </sentence><sentence id="43">And for whatever reason -- | can't give you the reason, but for whatever reason, we felt and the Dutch people felt that because we were neutral in World War I we probably will remain neutral in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="44">Needless to say, that did not turn out to be true and in May of 1940 the German army moved into <span class="country">Holland</span> and the war really was over before it even began because the whole Dutch army had to capitulate within a period of four or five days that we were no match for the German army who came in with a tremendous amount of air power etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="45">Being a Jew, of course, that was a very, very unsettling time for us. </sentence><sentence id="46">We didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="47">We saw the German army marching through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">For the first time in my life, I see the green uniforms which was the uniform of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="49">I'd never seen that before, and they marched through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and to be very honest, we were quite frightened by all of this. </sentence><sentence id="50">As it turned out, the first year of the occupation was completely uneventful. </sentence><sentence id="51">The Germans in that first year of occupation behaved almost unbelievably gentleman-like. </sentence><sentence id="52">They didn't bother anybody. </sentence><sentence id="53">There were no real problems. </sentence><sentence id="54">Until one day, a group of young Jews were arrested in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> just haphazardly. </sentence><sentence id="55">They were just taken off the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">There was no reason for it. </sentence><sentence id="57">And they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then followed by about a month or so later, there was -- I don't know whether it's exactly the way it happened, but there was an explosion in a <span class="building">German officer's club</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">Now whether it was an explosion or somebody let the soup boil over or whatever happened, I don't know what happened, but they decided to arrest 225 young German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="60">Not Dutch Jews, German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="61">And so one night I was coming <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">I came <span class="building">home</span> around four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="63">My brother was working, learning the metals trade, and my brother came <span class="building">home</span> about I would say around five-thirty. </sentence><sentence id="64">We lived on the <span class="interior space">ground floor</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and our <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> were outside on the <span class="dlf">window</span>, so people knew that we were <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">And the <span class="dlf">door</span> bell rang, and I never gave it a second thought and I walked up to the <span class="dlf">front door</span>, opened up the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and two men in brown leather coats pushed their way past me, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="66">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="67"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection went into the <span class="interior space">living room</span>, and came out with a list and they asked me whether anybody by the name of Hans Jiirgen(ph) von Halle lived here. </sentence><sentence id="68">Well, my brother was in the <span class="interior space">back room</span> and truthfully, I didn't know what to say, and before I could say anything my brother came out of the <span class="interior space">back room</span> and he wanted to know what was going on and they turned to him and said, "What's your name?" </sentence><sentence id="69">And he said, "My name is Hans Jiirgen(ph) von <span class="populated place">Halle</span>." </sentence><sentence id="70">And then they said, "Is there a <span class="populated place">Gerd Carl von Halle</span> here?" </sentence><sentence id="71">I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="72">They said, "What's your name." </sentence><sentence id="73">I said, "My name is Gerd Sigmund von Halle." </sentence><sentence id="74">They said, "Well, that must be the same one." </sentence><sentence id="75">So they put us under arrest and they pushed us out the <span class="dlf">front door</span> just the way we were. </sentence><sentence id="76">We did not have time to say goodbye to our parents. </sentence><sentence id="77">And they marched us from our <span class="building">house</span> to the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">Now when I say they marched us, we were not handcuffed. </sentence><sentence id="79">We were just -- my brother and I were just walking there individually, and these two Gestapo agents in their leather coats just followed behind about -- I don't know -- 20 feet behind, and all they did is tell us turn right, turn left, straight ahead. </sentence><sentence id="80">And so that if you had passed us by on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, you would never in a million years would you have known that these two young boys were under arrest. </sentence><sentence id="81">And we arrived at <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>, oh, I would say around five-thirty, six o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="82">And we were one of the last to arrive, and when I looked around I saw practically all of my friends were there. </sentence><sentence id="83">There were 226 young German Jews all lined up in that <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> which was a former <span class="building">girls school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">And we were lined up down in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, and we were shouted at and yelled at and, you know, we had to stand at attention. </sentence><sentence id="85">And we stood at attention from six o'clock until about midnight. </sentence><sentence id="86">And we weren't allowed to talk. </sentence><sentence id="87">We weren't allowed to move. </sentence><sentence id="88">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">And around midnight the commandant of the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> stepped forward and said, "Is there anybody here who has a serious and I mean serious illness to report?" </sentence><sentence id="90">And he explained that anybody who would be fooling him, he explained what the drastic consequences of that would be. </sentence><sentence id="91">My brother, who was standing next to me, pushed me sort of with his elbow and said, "Step forward." </sentence><sentence id="92">and I whispered back to him, I said, "What can I, what can I talk about ?" </sentence><sentence id="93">It so turned out as a child I was, I was not one of the strongest kids on the <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">I suffered a great deal from bronchitis which 5,000,000 other people suffer from, and my brother said to me, "Tell him you have TB?" </sentence><sentence id="95">I never had TB in my life, thank goodness. </sentence><sentence id="96">And I was very, very, very reluctant to step forward because I was afraid of the consequences because they told me what the consequences would be if you lied. </sentence><sentence id="97">But he sort of insisted on it, and since he was my older brother by a year and almost two years, I stepped forward and I had to go into he took me into a <span class="interior space">room</span> and he says, "What's the matter with you?" </sentence><sentence id="98">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And that's all he wanted to know and I -- he --I had to step back in <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">As it turned out, there was -- I said to you there was 220 -- there was 226 young German Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="100">And the order was to arrest these  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Jews between the ages of 16 and 21. </sentence><sentence id="101">Now, this -- there was one kid in this group of 226 who happened to be 15, and in typical German fashion when the order said 16 to 21, you only take people 16 to 21. </sentence><sentence id="102">This kid was 15 and, therefore, around midnight or thereabout, he was dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="103">The kid happened to be not a friend of mine, but he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="104">And he went directly from <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> to my parents" <span class="building">home</span>, told my parents what he saw. </sentence><sentence id="105">My parents could only put two and two together and surmised that probably what I told them that I suffer from TB They in turn went to my family physician, a Jewish Dutchman doctor by the name of Dr. Hertzberger. </sentence><sentence id="106">Dr. Hertzberger, when my parents told him what had happened wrote out a certificate which I gave to the <span class="building">museum</span>, which states that I am suffering from TB Now, so we're here now back in the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and around midnight or | o'clock in the morning we were transported from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> in <span class="spatial object">buses</span> to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Schoorl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">That's spelled S-C-H-O-O-R-L, which is near <span class="populated place">Alkmaar</span> in <span class="region">North Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">This was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> surrounded and protected by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="109">And we stayed there for approximately, oh, I would say, somewhere in the neighborhood of six to eight weeks. </sentence><sentence id="110">Our treatment now certainly wasn't good but it wasn't brutal to the degree that you know, we learned later on what happened in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">We were subjected to all the harassment and so on, but nobody was killed there. </sentence><sentence id="112">One day I was called into the <span class="building">commandant's office</span>, and as I went into the <span class="building">office</span> I snapped at attention and in front of his <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and I looked down on his <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and I saw a letter. </sentence><sentence id="113">I could see it even though it was upside down. </sentence><sentence id="114">I could see it was a letter of Dr. Hertzberger. </sentence><sentence id="115">And the commandant says to me, "What's wrong with you?" </sentence><sentence id="116">And I said to him, "I suffer from TB" And this man seemed to be the kind of individual that certainly did not want to be in the presence of anybody who had a contagious disease and he said to me, "Get out of here and get and get out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> immediately." </sentence><sentence id="117">So I ran back to my <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">I said goodbye to my brother who was with me there, and I was released that day. </sentence><sentence id="119">And now there were 224 boys left. </sentence><sentence id="120">These 224 boys that same day were sent from this <span class="populated place">local concentration camp</span> to probably one of the most infamous <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> of all called <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> in <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">I came back from <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">L arrived, I had no money. </sentence><sentence id="123">I hitchhiked my way back to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> from there, and I was very, very busy going around seeing all of the parents of my friends who had been there and telling everybody that everybody was doing well under the circumstances etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="124">We received a card from my brother from the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> which is -- now remember, we're talking about the year 1941. </sentence><sentence id="125">That was in the early part of the war. </sentence><sentence id="126">We received a letter, a post card from him, which was a sort of a printed post card. </sentence><sentence id="127">It just said, "T," then he filled in his name, "Hans Jiirgen von Halle, born May 7th, 1921, am in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> as of such and such a date as prisoner number so and so in <span class="building">barrack</span> number so and so, etcetera."" </sentence><sentence id="128">Now it was very unusual to receive a letter like this, but the reason why we received it because as I said before, it was still 1941. </sentence><sentence id="129">We also received two letters from him. </sentence><sentence id="130">The letters I also gave to the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">We were not a sentimental family. </sentence><sentence id="132">Somehow we were brought up in the -- I don't know how to put it. </sentence><sentence id="133">In the --well we were not brought up sentimentally. </sentence><sentence id="134">And when we saw the letter with my brother which started off-- he wrote in German because they had to pass the, the what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="135">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="136">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="137"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection The censor. </sentence><sentence id="138">He wrote in German, "Liebe, liebe, Eltern,&gt;" "Dear, dear parents." </sentence><sentence id="139">Now that is not the way my brother would speak. </sentence><sentence id="140">He does not say, "Dear, dear parent." </sentence><sentence id="141">That is not his language. </sentence><sentence id="142">And that was not my language. </sentence><sentence id="143">And then he goes through the letter and in the letter you can see -- when you read the letter, you can see the absolutely desperation that these boys were in, that he was in. </sentence><sentence id="144">We received two letters and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="145">Shortly after the last letter arrived, I got a--I don't remember whether it was a call or a notice from the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> that somebody from the family had to report to <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And my parents wanted to go and I didn't allow them to go and I went there. </sentence><sentence id="147">And what happened is they showed us a list of all 224 boys. </sentence><sentence id="148">Everyone of them had died of "pneumonia" quote unquote. </sentence><sentence id="149">Needless to say, from what I understand <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> was one of the most cruel <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">They didn't have a <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">They didn't have to have a <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">This was a <span class="dlf">stone quarry</span>, and from what I understand these boys were just lined up at the top of the <span class="dlf">quarry</span> and just pushed down into the <span class="dlf">quarry</span> which was -- whatever it was, a hundred feet lower below and just pushed to their death. </sentence><sentence id="153">Very efficient way of killing people without bullets, without gas, without anything. </sentence><sentence id="154">Well, I came back <span class="building">home</span> and this was probably one of the most difficult things for me to tell my parents that their -- let's see, my brother was maybe 21 or 20, he was 20 -- that their 20 year old son, six foot tall, broad shoulders, never been sick in his life, had died of pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="155">My, my mother who was the strong party in the family stood up very well. </sentence><sentence id="156">My father absolutely disintegrated. </sentence><sentence id="157">He absolutely disintegrated about the news. </sentence><sentence id="158">Couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="159">Couldn't hack it. </sentence><sentence id="160">And my mother really sort of was the, as you might say, the Starke*. </sentence><sentence id="161">And so that was the first chapter in the story. </sentence><sentence id="162">We then -- 1941 -- we then continued things -- after that, things moved quickly. </sentence><sentence id="163">We were of course Jews were not allowed to go on the <span class="spatial object">street car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">Jews were not allowed to have <span class="spatial object">radios</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">You had to turn them in. </sentence><sentence id="166">Jews weren't allowed to have silver. </sentence><sentence id="167">You had to turn them in. </sentence><sentence id="168">Then came the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="169">Everybody had to wear the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="170">And I'll tell you quite frankly, wearing a yellow star, even though I was certainly very proud to be a Jew, but going out into the <span class="dlf">street</span> with a star about the size this big with the word Jew or in Dutch J. ood?, </sentence><sentence id="171">J- O-O-D, printed on it is a very, very strange feeling. </sentence><sentence id="172">Very strange indeed. </sentence><sentence id="173">It's not the kind of a thing that, if you've never experienced it, it's like going on the <span class="dlf">street</span> today and saying I have, you know, I'm a prisoner or going out on the <span class="dlf">street</span> with a <span class="building">prison</span> uniform. </sentence><sentence id="174">It's almost the same comparison. </sentence><sentence id="175">More arrests and more arrests and more arrests and before you knew it, these friends were taken prisoners and these friends were taken prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="176">In the meantime, in order to be able to escape from deportation, I took a job learning the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection shoemaker's trade. </sentence><sentence id="177">You were becoming a shoemaker to the Jewish population and for a limited period of time that exempted you from being deported, so I became a shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="178">And realizing, of course, that this was strictly a limited kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="179">This was not going to be anything of longstanding and I one day, I said to my parents, "This can't go on. </sentence><sentence id="180">There are too many people have been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="181">Our turn, if it's not today, it will be tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="182">If it's not tomorrow, it will be next week. </sentence><sentence id="183">We have to get out of here." </sentence><sentence id="184">And so we decided one day, actually from one day to the next we decided to leave our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I want you to know that we just left the <span class="building">house</span> just the way it was, with the pictures on the walls and the food in the <span class="spatial object">refrigerator</span> and the clothes in the <span class="interior space">closet</span> and, and, and nothing was taken. </sentence><sentence id="186">The only thing we did is we gave the key to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to one of our neighbors who we knew and trusted and these were two ladies which I will come back to later on in my story. </sentence><sentence id="187">And they had a key to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">But we just left. </sentence><sentence id="189">I only attended <span class="building">college</span> for one year. </sentence><sentence id="190">And one of the college professors. </sentence><sentence id="191">His name was Mr. In't Hout, I-N-apostrophe-T H-O-U-T.In't Hout, that was his name. </sentence><sentence id="192">I called him and I told him what our situation was. </sentence><sentence id="193">And without blinking an eye, without hesitating for one minute, he says, "Come right over." </sentence><sentence id="194">And so we walked out of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and we went to Mr. In't Hout's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and it was just a small --was a family of four, a husband and wife and two children, a boy and girl about my age. </sentence><sentence id="195">And there was no <span class="interior space">room</span> for three people. </sentence><sentence id="196">There were only two -- it was, it was a three- bedroom <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and one <span class="interior space">room</span> was occupied by the parents and one <span class="interior space">room</span> was occupied by the girl and one <span class="interior space">room</span> was occupied by the boy, and what they did is they put the boy and the girl together in one <span class="interior space">room</span> and gave me the third <span class="interior space">room</span> and their brother-in-law took my parents. </sentence><sentence id="197">Now the problem was, now that we are no longer officially in residence in our regular <span class="building">home</span>, we now no longer have access to rationing cards. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="220">Mrs. Kahn(ph) went out the <span class="dlf">back door</span> into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">Mr.Kahn(ph) went into the

</sentence><sentence id="226">So what they did is they took all of the <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> from Mrs. Kahn(ph), Mr. and Mrs.Kahn(ph) and they put them into our <span

</sentence><sentence id="231">Because they themselves barricaded that one <span class="interior space">closet</span> and so that was the reason why they didn't get in there. </sentence><sentence id="232">They left with the prisoners, with my father, Mr. Kahn(ph) and the and the farmer, and they sealed the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">They sealed the <span class="interior space">room</span> in which my mother was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="234">The put a wax seal on it and they said they would be back two hours later to get, to get the

that point. </sentence><sentence id="237">My mother came out of the <span class="interior space">closet</span> and we are now discussing what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="238">We couldn't get out of the <span class="building">house</span> because the <span class="building">house</span> was surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="239">If there were 200 families -- if there were 200 people in the, in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, I think all 200 hundred were standing around the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">So there was no way to get her out through the <span class="dlf">window</span> or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="241">Beside the <span class="dlf">window</span> was up on the <span class="interior space">second

nothing, based on gut feeling if you want to call it, that I wanted her to go under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">So she went under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and I went back into my little hiding place there. </sentence><sentence id="246">And sure enough, couple of hours later they came back and they opened the <span

the <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>, put it on top of the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">Actually only two men came back. </sentence><sentence

<span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="254">And I remember like it was yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="255">I had the first electric razor that ever was made. </sentence><sentence id="256">Not that I was the first one, but it was one of the first <span class="spatial object">razors</span> ever made by Phillips. </sentence><sentence id="257">And all of a
