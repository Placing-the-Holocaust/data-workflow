<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: Tell me, what was your full name at birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Well, actually, it was Jean, J-e-a-n. Jean Ernest Dolibois, pronounced Dolibois in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> because it is a -- a French name. </sentence><sentence id="7">My father is Parisian -- Parisian ancestry, so in -- in <span class="country">Europe</span> it's <span class="populated place">Dolibois</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">But <span class="populated place">Dolibois</span> like <span class="region">Illinois</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span>, it makes it a lot easier, so that's just a -- but a -- when I became naturalized, I paid a dollar extra for the naturalization fee, to change the Jean, J-e-a-n, which would be pronounced Jean, to John, J-o-h-n. So at least my first name is still a -- Americanized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: And tell me what year you were born and where in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I was born in <span class="populated place">Luxembourg City</span>, actually a s-s -- the suburb <span class="populated place">Bonava</span>, of <span class="populated place">Luxembourg City</span>, on the <span class="dlf">avenue</span> -- on the <span class="dlf">Rue de Chicago</span>, predestination apparently. </sentence><sentence id="15">And the -- I was born on December fourth, 1918. </sentence><sentence id="16">My -- was immediately after -- shortly after the signing of the armistice and I was born the youngest of eight children. </sentence><sentence id="17">Unfortunately my mother died 10 days later. </sentence><sentence id="18">So my oldest sister Marie had to step in and -- and play the role of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="19">And she actually raised me. </sentence><sentence id="20">In fact, up until the day she died, I called her mom, you know, she was -- al-although she was my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: That's interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: But she actually is involved in my coming to the <span class="country">United States</span> as an immigrant. </sentence><sentence id="31">I don't know if you want to hear that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: Yeah, I do, I do, yes, I kn -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="33">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="34"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: -- romantic story, because it is that. </sentence><sentence id="36">Well after World War I, we did have American occupation troops in <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span> because the <span class="country">United States</span> -- the Americans had liberated <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span> from four years of occupation by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="37">So there were American troops stationed in <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span> and some Americans were billeted in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">And as things would happen, my sister was 19 years old, fell in love with one of the Americans, and they planned to get married, if -- when he got out of the service. </sentence><sentence id="39">But then I was born, my mother died, and my sister had to take care of the rest of the family and play the role of mother. </sentence><sentence id="40">So the American came back empty handed, but they corresponded with each other for 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="41">He came back in 1929 and married her and brought her to the <span class="country">United States</span>, to <span class="populated place">Akron</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">Meanwhile my brothers and si -- brothers and sisters had all grown up and married, and my father and I were all alone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">So my father, who had pretty good political sense, and could look across the <span class="env feature">Mosselle river</span> and see what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and he didn't see much of a future for -- for me, at least, in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, and he thought history could repeat itself, so he decided we ought to get out, come to the <span class="country">United States</span> and take advantage of the land of opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="44">And so my father and I came to the <span class="country">States</span> in 1931 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Let me ask you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: -- and joined my sister now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: -- I'm sure is a rare -- rare story. </sentence><sentence id="61">I -- 1 -- I understand from your autobiography that your -- your dad and you were quite different and your interest in education did not match his interest, is that true? </sentence><sentence id="62">Was that difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Yeah, my -- my father, who was a -- a very loving father and I respected him greatly, and -- and love him dearly, but he was not what we think of as a dad in the <span class="country">United States</span>, there. </sentence><sentence id="67">There was no such thing as going to a ballgame or even going on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="68">I don't remember my father ever taking me on a vacation trip or anything. </sentence><sentence id="69">He worked -- he worked hard, he was in the <span class="building">construction business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">But we had eight children, I was the -- the youngest of the eight and my father had been quite successful in business. </sentence><sentence id="71">All of my brothers, with one exception, all worked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="72">They all went into the building trade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and each one of them had a specialty and they worked in my father's company. </sentence><sentence id="73">And naturally that's what was in store for me. </sentence><sentence id="74">Well, for some reason or other I had different ideas, I'm -- I had ambitions. </sentence><sentence id="75">So when we came to the <span class="country">United States</span> my father resisted my interest in having an education, and he -- he liked to point out that he never went to <span class="building">college</span>, and he never even went to <span class="building">high school</span>, and he was a success in life, why did I want to waste my time? </sentence><sentence id="76">And he had peculiar ideas, and -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="77">Don't read so much, you" ll ge -- you" lI ruin your eyes. </sentence><sentence id="78">And he didn't even want me to have a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> because he said it was a useless article, y-you pump your legs off to give your rear end a ride, you know. </sentence><sentence id="79">But he had very narrow views about that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="80">But strangely enough, when I insisted and followed my own <span class="dlf">path</span>, he was the first one to step up front and point with pride. </sentence><sentence id="81">And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">He -- he took upon himself to let everybody know that -- when I became a valedictorian in <span class="building">high school</span>, he -- he patted himself on the back, too, it's -- it's a -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="83">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="84"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Do you think he was frightened in some way of the difference that -- how you were different from -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Of -- that's absolute -- that's absolutely right, he -- he -- he never adapted. </sentence><sentence id="106">And he made the sacrifice, coming to the <span class="country">United States</span>, for my sake. </sentence><sentence id="107">And I've always given him credit for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="111">But he never assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="112">He never wanted to be part of the -- he -- he didn't even bother to learn the language. </sentence><sentence id="113">He wanted to just remain what -- what he was. </sentence><sentence id="114">And proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="115">But -- and so I didn't fit that pattern, right, I created a pattern of my own. </sentence><sentence id="116">And naturally, with his old fashioned, basically <span class="dlf">European viewpoint</span>, he just didn't -- didn't see that. </sentence><sentence id="117">He couldn't agree with that. </sentence><sentence id="118">I mean, we didn't have any arguments about it, but he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da -- you don't need to do that, I never did it, look at me. </sentence><sentence id="119">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: And did your sister support your -- your doing what -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Oh yeah, she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own, because I -- I was - - made perfectly clear that I wasn't going to sponge off of my sister and her family. </sentence><sentence id="122">She had her - - her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline. </sentence><sentence id="123">And -- so it was still possible to do it in the <span class="country">United States</span> -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Did your dad work when he came over here, or did he stop working? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, he wa -- he was really -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="130">But he did work around the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">He would, you know, repair things for -- for people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing, and -- but we sold our <span class="building">family homestead</span> -- our <span class="building">family home</span>, and my father could pretty much live on that. </sentence><sentence id="132">He -- he was up in years, he was a -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: -- see, well it's the 50 -- he was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: 1872. </sentence><sentence id="147">Right, so he wasn't such a young -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: So, he was retired. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: And so. </sentence><sentence id="152">But he did manage to keep busy around the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and -- in <span class="populated place">Akron</span> and earn some pocket money and so forth, but there was never a -- never any want, I mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: So he never learned English? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: He never learned English? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: No, no, it -- he could -- he'd read the paper, at least he pretended to read, and he kept pretty much informed of what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="161">But there was a <span class="building">German church</span> in -- in <span class="populated place">Akron</span> that he went to. </sentence><sentence id="162">At least one sermon was preached in German in <span class="building">Saint Bernard church</span>, I recall. </sentence><sentence id="163">So he kept up his contacts that way, and he subscribed to a -- a <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> paper and a German paper. </sentence><sentence id="164">He could read German. </sentence><sentence id="165">Although he was born in f -- in <span class="country">France</span>, his French was not very good. </sentence><sentence id="166">He was primarily Germanic because his family had moved from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to the <span class="region">Saar Basin</span>, at the time that <span class="populated place">Saar</span> was still a part of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Of course, the <span class="region">Saar</span> went back and forth and one time German, then it was independent, and then it was again part of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">So in the <span class="region">Saar</span> almost everybody spoke French and German, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Did you like -- did you like the idea of coming to the <span class="country">United States</span>? </sentence><sentence id="188">Were you happy about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Well, I think -- you know, I wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> were American movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson. </sentence><sentence id="192">And the idea of cowboys and Indians appealed to me. </sentence><sentence id="193">There's an author that every boy in -- in <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>, and for that matter, I think in <span class="region">western Europe</span> reads as a boy and those are a series of novels about the American Indians and cowboys, written by Karl May. </sentence><sentence id="194">And everybody has read Karl May, as I did. </sentence><sentence id="195">And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life was like in <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">That part appealed to me very much, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, and the idea of also leaving all my friends, and the culture that I was used to in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, that created some problems, so I had a conflict. </sentence><sentence id="197">I was excited in one way, and another way a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it. </sentence><sentence id="208">So the -- I didn't want to leave, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Wh-When you came here in "31, it's two years prior to the Nazis taking over in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="210">When they take over in <span class="country">Germany</span>, does that impact you at all? </sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, you're still European in some way, so the consciousness of what's going on in Europe -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Oh, I think I was too young to be aware of -- of really what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="213">I don't think that I became particularly interested in what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="214">Wa -- once we got to the <span class="country">States</span>, I did, I think, what I now think every immigrant should do. </sentence><sentence id="215">First of all concentrate on learning the language, and I -- I couldn't speak a word of English, so I had work pretty hard, because I went to <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="building">public school</span>, and they immediately sent me back two years. </sentence><sentence id="216">I should have been in the eighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, but before that I -- they put me in <span class="building">kindergarten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="218">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="219"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And here I am 13 years old, and I'm in <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, the biggest boy in <span class="building">class</span>, but that was the only advantage. </sentence><sentence id="220">But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in <span class="building">kindergarten</span> and then a couple of more months in the <span class="building">third grade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And then moved me up to, finally, the sixth grade, and I went on from there. </sentence><sentence id="222">But I think I concentrated on becoming a Boy Scout, and becoming Americanized, and I -- I loved the Boy Scout experience. </sentence><sentence id="223">That contributed a great deal to my Americanization. </sentence><sentence id="224">And learning the language was -- was a challenge. </sentence><sentence id="225">And as I say, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential to become a part of the American scene, you know, you should. </sentence><sentence id="226">So I didn't -- I really sort of forgot all about <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> and -- to the point where even corresponding with my friends became secondary and I didn't do much of it any more. </sentence><sentence id="227">That all came back later, see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="246">But all of your brothers and sisters, except for Marie, are -- are in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1711">A: First of all, the more they were interrogated, the more important they were, because if -- if you had a lot of interrogations, in the eyes of the other prisoners, the enemy considered you a decision maker, you were obviously one of the top men. </sentence><sentence id="1712">If you were not interrogated at all, which was true of some of the people, I don't know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn't have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Nobody knew who they were. </sentence><sentence id="1714">But they had a uniform on and they happened to be at the wrong place at the right time and were taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they were with somebody, if they were in the presence of Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Like his -- his adjutant, or his aid. </sentence><sentence id="1716">They were all taken prisoner, unfortunately because they happened to be Goering's aid, but they had no intelligence value, and they were not permitted to continue to be his aid. </sentence><sentence id="1717">They just became ordinary prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1718">So we -- we had prisoners who -- who -- who just -- we didn't know why they were there, and they didn't know why they were there, and they wanted to be interrogated so they could -- they could at least feel that they were important. </sentence><sentence id="1719">That was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1720">The other thing was none of these prisoners presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none of them worked as part of a team, a united effort to protect each other. </sentence><sentence id="1721">They were all protecting This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1722">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1723"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 only themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Not a single one ever thought in terms of protecting the German general's staff, or protecting the -- the Nazi element, or the bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we had. </sentence><sentence id="1725">And those were the three categories that automatically they divided themselves into. </sentence><sentence id="1726">The general's staff pretty much stuck together socially in the <span class="building">prison</span>, in their -- their discussion groups and their cliques. </sentence><sentence id="1727">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1728">When they sat on the <span class="interior space">veranda</span> or in the <span class="interior space">lounge</span>, or when they ate together, they pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis pretty much stuck together. </sentence><sentence id="1729">And the same thing with the statesmen or the ministers and some of those. </sentence><sentence id="1730">So each one was out to save his own neck. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And they had grievances that went back to Hitler's time, back to 1934 - 35. </sentence><sentence id="1732">If Goering snubbed this particular general, this general now had an opportunity to spill the beans about Goering. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Petty stuff, but this is exactly what we wanted -- w-we wanted to hear. </sentence><sentence id="1734">So the socializing with each other and visiting with each other was all part of a interrogation scheme. </sentence><sentence id="1735">We had a conflict of our own, cause on one hand, there were five of us, five interrogators. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And we belonged to the Richie crowd, we were the trained military intelligence personnel. </sentence><sentence id="1737">We had nothing to do with the operation of the <span class="building">prison</span>, of how the prisoners were fed, or how they were housed or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1738">That was under the command of the -- of Colonel Andrews, Burton C.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1849">A: Well, he treat -- as far as he was concerned, they were prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1850">And one of my jobs -- Andrews took a personal liking to me, primarily because I knew my way around <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1851">So whenever we had a VIP visitor like General Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher officials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appointed tour guide. </sentence><sentence id="1852">So that became one of my functions. </sentence><sentence id="1853">In addition to what I had to do, I would take them around <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> and show them places. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Well, Andrews enjoyed that part of it himself because he would always go along and -- and I'd on a couple of occasions invited Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And bourbon was just not available anywhere, except as we got it in our liquor ration in <span class="populated place">Mondorf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1856">So every once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the few of us officers would get together and have a little party, and we invited Prince Felix to a couple of these affairs, which impressed Colonel Andrews very much. </sentence><sentence id="1857">So we finally got around to the point of where he saw our <span class="dlf">viewpoint</span> in addition to the official persuasion he got from above. </sentence><sentence id="1858">You know, we can't treat these people like convicted criminals serving their sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1859">We have to try them first, and before we can try them, we had to interrogate them, and -- and that public relations effort helped considerably. </sentence><sentence id="1860">It also resulted in my being at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> when I had done everything possible to avoid going to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, cause I was tired of the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1861">But once I arrived there on temporary duty, Andrews snagged me and he wouldn't let me go because he wanted me back on his staff again. </sentence><sentence id="1862">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1863">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for

</sentence><sentence id="1865">But he used me also to translate his messages to the -- the prisoners whenever -- for instance, when Streicher arrived, Doenitz refused on behalf of the other prisoners, to eat in the same <span class="interior space">dining room</span> with Streicher. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Well then Andrews wrote a message to be delivered to them, and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and -- which we told them it -- you have no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1867">I mean, he's your boy and you're going to eat with him whether you like it or not, cause you're all alike. </sentence><sentence id="1868">We're not looking at you as a grand admiral, or you as a Reichsmarshall. </sentence><sentence id="1869">We're looking at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and that's what <span class="building">Streicher</span> is, and you're going to eat in the same <span class="interior space">dining room</span>, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1870">That -- that's the kind of message that Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding crop that he carried all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1871">High polished boots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin" image of General Patton when it came to dress and bearing and he loved to play the commanding officer, which sometimes the Nazis u-used against all of us in a humorous sense. </sentence><sentence id="1872">For instance, one general, I forget what his name was, had not -- Andrews came walking into the <span class="interior space">room</span> and -- and the general didn't stand up and click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the <span class="interior space">basement room</span> which Andrews kept for solitary confinement. </sentence><sentence id="1873">And then he wrote an order that whenever he walked into a <span class="interior space">room</span> they were to stand up at attention and -- and salute him. </sentence><sentence id="1874">Well, they carried it to the other extreme so whenever any one of us entered the <span class="interior space">room</span> they did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And it got to be sort of humorous, here I was a first lieutenant and if they were all sitting on the vera -- <span class="interior space">veranda</span> in the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of these guys, and I would come back from lunch and walk it up -- they would all stand up and click their heels and bow, and say good afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And it got to be a joke until they got tired of it, but we had a -- light moments with them too. </sentence><sentence id="1877">But we did convince Andrews finally to let us do our -- our thing, as long as the prisoners didn't violate any of the rules he'd go along with it, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1878">It is

this collection 6 that was one of the challenges. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Other than that, our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of -- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pretended to be the welfare officer. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Well, I was the welfare officer because I made the rounds. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I would go from <span class="interior space">room</span> to <span class="interior space">room</span> and I would ask the prisoner how -- how are you today, and at first they were very busy writing letters to General Eisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they were heads of state, or former heads of state. </sentence><sentence id="1883">And they were complaining about their treatment and making demands. </sentence><sentence id="1884">And our job was to translate those letters, send them -- send them out through <span class="dlf">channels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And we never got any replies, I assume they're still going through <span class="dlf">channels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1886">But -- so if they had a letter that they wanted to write to someone, they would give it to me to translate for them, and send it on. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Or if they wanted to locate their family. </sentence><sentence id="1888">You know, I -- I don't know where my wife is, could you try to find out where she is? </sentence><sentence id="1889">And we would, which is very simple thing because for instance, a lot of them lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to them as the bunsin, the big -- the big boys -- a lot of the Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster. </sentence><sentence id="1890">Ma-Many of them had their <span class="building">villas</span> at <span class="populated place">Tegernsee</span> in <span class="region">Bavaria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1891">So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her, we could contact a <span class="building">military unit</span> of ours stationed near <span class="populated place">Tegernsee</span> and ask them to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And we got to the point where we could sometimes forward letters. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And that helped tremendously in getting their cooperation and telling me things that -- that we wanted to hear. </sentence><sentence id="1894">So I would make the rounds and -- and somebody would say, I don't have any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an extra ration of toothpaste, shampoo, or I have a dandruff problem. </sentence><sentence id="1895">Goering had a skin problem and he always -- he wanted special lotions and special soaps, which we couldn't furnish, but at least I listened to his complaints and -- and by listening and sympathizing with him, that -- that helped pave the way. </sentence><sentence id="1896">What happened then was that every one of us had a specialty. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I really specialized in the German general's staff. </sentence><sentence id="1898">The history of the German general's staff, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1899">This is a verbatim

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 So a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategies and organization and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1902">With the result that each one of the five of us would have only a certain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldn't get to know anything about any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Well, I was the welfare officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even though I never interrogated them. </sentence><sentence id="1904">But I would g-go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing, how do you feel? </sentence><sentence id="1905">And I would end up getting a lot of information that helped my performance, because I kept this gossip file about one s -- prisoner said about the other. </sentence><sentence id="1906">But one in particular stands out, was old <span class="building">Papa Schwartz</span>, <span class="building">Franz Xavier Schwartz</span>, was called <span class="building">Papa Schwartz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1907">He was the Nazi party treasurer. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Simple, kind old guy, really. </sentence><sentence id="1909">He didn't know what the score was. </sentence><sentence id="1910">But he was a very popular politician in <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span> and Hitler used him to collect the dues. </sentence><sentence id="1911">If you belong to the Nazi party, you paid yo-your party dues. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And that's all Schwartz did, he collected dues. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And now you think Nazi party treasurer would have been a very important guy, who certainly would have a lot to do with buying <span class="dlf">property</span> and -- and receiving big contributions. </sentence><sentence id="1914">That wasn't Schwartz's job, that was somebody else's responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1915">That was <span class="populated place">Funk</span>, and to a certain extent at first, <span class="building">Schacht</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1916">So Schwartz, I don't even know why we -- we brou -- he was never interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="1917">He really served no particular purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1918">And his son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr. </sentence><sentence id="1919">was the president of <span class="building">German breweries</span>, which really had no particular connection, but he did have a - - a paramilitary rank in th -- either the SS or the SA. </sentence><sentence id="1920">A lot of people, if you made a big contribution financially, if you were an industrialist, you would got a -- get a rank like a sturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing more than an honorary title, and i -- and you could -- got to wear a uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1921">So if you were president of the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1925">So we ended up with a lot of these deadbeats. </sentence><sentence id="1926">Well, Schwartz looked very much like my father, physical image. </sentence><sentence id="1927">My father had sort of a white mustache, little [indecipherable] like <span class="building">Hindenburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1928">And Schwartz looked like my father and the first time I went in to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because it looked almost like my own papa sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1929">And he noticed that and wanted to know what -- you know, what made you -- he said -- upshraken was the German word, la -- what made you pull back. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And just in a moment of candor I said, "W-Well, because you look very much like my father." </sentence><sentence id="1931">And then I showed him a picture of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And he -- he started to cry, he got -- he -- he got very emotional about that. </sentence><sentence id="1933">He th -- he thought that was just a wonderful coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="1934">He's -- he's a Roman Catholic, he was very devout, and he thought surely that God had ordained for this to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1935">Well, I -- I had to take advantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a father confessor. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And they would go to <span class="populated place">Papa Schwartz</span> and tell him things that they didn't tell anybody else, especially after an -- an interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1937">They were going to <span class="populated place">Papa Schwartz</span> and say, well they asked me about this, but I told them that, but the truth of the matter is. </sentence><sentence id="1938">Well then, after I showed -- after wa -- won the confidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he'd say, don't trust so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And he would -- he would tell me things about what the prisoner had said to him. </sentence><sentence id="1940">And it was that kind of play that -- that resulted in our getting more information than we really knew how to cope with, in addition to our official interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="1941">We worked for the <span class="building">Nazi war crimes commission</span>, which was headed by <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be our prosecutor for the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2769">So they were put into <span class="building">school buildings</span> and even some abandoned <span class="building">factories</span>, as a temporary measure to concentrate them out of sight where we could concentrate -- keep our eyes on them. </sentence><sentence id="2770">Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was just convenient to keep them there. </sentence><sentence id="2771">It turned out that many of the communists were Jews, so it was natural for those communists, and those Jews to end up in the <span class="populated

the connection with this general -- and we thought that was the -- the spy on the higher rank, because the relationship -- and they were exchanging notes with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3797">And we -- our curiosity was aroused by how -- how she could write a note and end up -- ends up in his <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3798">So obviously

id="3800">So this was one of my functions, that -- that Colonel Andrews delegated to me when I became his special assistant. </sentence><sentence id="3801">So I was to find out how this note business was going about. </sentence><sentence id="3802">And wi -- the -- the whole incident was that I -- I went -- went to her <span class="interior space">cell</span>, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="3803">And the guards were not allowed in the <span class="interior space">cells</span> at all. </sentence><sentence id="3804">They were -- they had to stand outside the <span class="interior

women prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="3806">But I noticed that Vitchell, who was a rather striking looking woman, and when -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe that came all the way to her feet. </sentence><sentence id="3807">And -- which I thought was unusual <span class="building">prison</span> garb, but they weren't really being held as -- as criminals, so I didn't pay too much

was listening on the outside, which I think he was, and there really wasn't anything I could do about it, and it really wasn't that much of an issue. </sentence><sentence id="3819">But obviously one of the guards who was willing to carry the messages was giving extra cigarettes and doing her that favor, which -- it struck my sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="3820">I don't think it was a criminal offense, I didn't want to -- but I knew if I reported this to Colonel Andrews, somebody would end up in the -- in the <span class="spatial object">brig</span>, and somebody would be severely punished. </sentence><sentence id="3821">So I -- [had a little fun, I came out of the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and the guard was standing in there, and just by looking at him, I could tell that he -- he knew what I -- what the conversation was, cause he's all red in the face, and -- and being extra polite and standing at rigid attention, almost like a <span class="spatial object">statue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3822">So I just went up to him right face to face and looked at him and said, if you won't tell, I won't tell, or something to that effect, and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="3823">And he said, "Thank you, sir." </sentence><sentence id="3824">And he clicked his heels. </sentence><sentence id="3825">And I became very popular with the guards cause the word got around very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3826">But I reported this to Colonel Andrews, who had no sense of humor at all. </sentence><sentence id="3827">And Colonel Andrews

at her in the nude or even dressed. </sentence><sentence id="3830">So that made it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause he - - he enjoyed his story so much, but he did have it all screwed up.

id="3948">One more secret to the story of <span class="populated place">Warlimont</span> is that on our way <span class="building">home</span> -- and I did get the documents. </sentence><sentence id="3949">And I don't know what happened to all of the documents, but I do know that years later I purchased a book from my <span class="building">library</span> written by John Wheeler Bennett, which was the -- the mc -- "Nemesis of Power; A History of the German General's Staff." </sentence><sentence id="3950">And I know that a lot of the research and documentation that appeared in John Wheeler

class="building">home</span> I didn't travel the <span class="dlf">Autobahn</span>, I took the side <span class="dlf">roads</span>, because just in case of an accident or something, I still would have

much. </sentence><sentence id="3953">And we were right near the <span class="building">Bavarian headquarters</span> of General Patton, who had been appointed the military governor of <span

</sentence><sentence id="3971">It was August -- yeah, I think it's August eighth. </sentence><sentence id="3972">Anyhow, I went back there several weeks later on another business trip and stopped

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4752">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4753">And President Reagan was coming to Europe to commemorate the 40" anniversary and also to attend the summit

those who fought, so forth, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4760">And Reagan, who was pretty easily ac -- accepting recommendation, accepted that he would -- he would do this. </sentence><sentence id="4761">I was attending a birthday party for Arthur Burns, who was our ambassador to <span class="country">Germany</span>, and Arthur Burns told me that Reagan was coming to <span class="country">Germany</span> for an official visit. </sentence><sentence id="4762">And he thought that he shouldn't visit the <span class="dlf">German military cemetery</span>, that would cause a lot of friction. </sentence><sentence id="4763">Arthur Burns knew what the score was. </sentence><sentence id="4764">And I agreed with him. </sentence><sentence id="4765">And then Arthur Burns said, "Why don't you make a counter-suggestion and have him come to the <span class="dlf">American cemetery</span> in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> instead?" </sentence><sentence id="4766">And I said, "Why don't you, Arthur?" </sentence><sentence id="4767">And he said, "We're both passing the buck." </sentence><sentence id="4768">And he said, "I'm the host ambassador and if I get involved

</sentence><sentence id="4770">So I stuck my neck out and I sent a cable, and that was a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="4771">There is such a thing as a <span class="building">White House</span>

declare war on the <span class="country">United States</span> or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="4775">But I should have used it to call the president and tell him -- to invite him to come to <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, my proposal being that the <span class="spatial object">helicopter</span>, which is at his disposal would come from <span class="populated place">Bittburg</span> where he was making an official visit to the military -- that was our biggest <span class="building">military base</span>, and our most important -- 15 -- 15 minutes less than,

in a <span class="dlf">parking lot</span>, I had it all described, and lay a wreath at General Patton's tomb. </sentence><sentence id="4779">Then go down 500 yards from the <span class="dlf">American cemetery</span>, there's a <span class="dlf">German military cemetery</span> where 11,000 Germans are buried. </sentence><sentence id="4780">And he could lay a wreath there at the <span

<span class="building">president's office</span> as a recommendation from an ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="4785">And I think Michael Dever got it and f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was in so many words, mind your own business. </sentence><sentence id="4786">This is all settled. </sentence><sentence id="4787">And that was the e-end of it. </sentence><sentence id="4788">I should have had the courage to -- cause I'd corresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I became ambassador of course, but he knew who I was, and it was on Dear John basis. </sentence><sentence id="4789">And I think I could have gotten through to him, and I've kicked myself ever since. </sentence><sentence id="4790">But anyhow, Reagan came to <span

id="4791">Michael Dever had been there to inspect the <span class="dlf">site</span>, but the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> was covered with snow, so he couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence

an invitation from the <span class="building">Jewish community congregation</span> in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, that there was going to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same time that Reagan was in <span class="populated place">Bittburg</span> at the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, at the <span class="dlf">American cemetery</span> in [indecipherable].Would I accept to come?

putting you on the <span class="dlf">spot</span>." </sentence><sentence id="4799">Beca -- I had a very good relationship with him, I used to give talks to a <span class="interior space">roomful</span> of survivors from <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> and -- and Rabbi Boltz is a -- a good personal friend, and used to invite him to our <span class="building">embassy</span>, along with the

much surprised, and I went. </sentence><sentence id="4805">And that's where I met Rabbi Here, and also some other members of the <span class="building">Wiesenthal Center</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4806">And the second surprise was that I was willing to make a talk -- give a talk, and so I did. </sentence><sentence id="4807">And I brought greetings from the president. </sentence><sentence id="4808">And I was wise enough to at least notify the president that I was going to be there. </sentence><sentence id="4809">Well, the media was there in force, and they really expected me to take off and either blast the president or make some comment. </sentence><sentence id="4810">And -- and I didn't, all -- the only thing I said was I think President Reagan should be here instead of in <span class="populated place">Bittburg</span>, because this where he could have devil -- deliver a really significant message. </sentence><sentence id="4811">But he's not, and I'm here to represent

was happy, except the media, cause I really let them down, I didn't -- I didn't stick my neck out and jeopardize my job. </sentence><sentence id="4812">But I was jeopardizing it because if Reagan had taken offense, or somebody else had wanted to take issue -- but Schulz was very understanding, and he complimented me. </sentence><sentence id="4813">And Weinberger complimented me and they all said fine, everything is great. </sentence><sentence id="4814">And then Reagan's own speech -- that afternoon, we went -- Winnie and I went to <span class="populated place">Bittburg</span> and -- and heard

presentations, with which I disagree, that he was perfectly willing to go to that <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4820">Actually, at that point -- President Reagan was the kind of president who relied pretty much on his lieutenants. </sentence><sentence id="4821">He -- he delegated, and he was a eight to five man, and some of that is good and some of it is bad. </sentence><sentence id="4822">But he didn't get involved in details, he never did. </sentence><sentence id="4823">Some presidents get too involved in details and that's wrong, too. </sentence><sentence id="4824">And you do have a staff, you do have people around you and a <span class="spatial object">cabinet</span>, so take what you will of that. </sentence><sentence id="4825">But -- but Reagan really didn't know -- I don't think ever -- anybody ever told him that there were Waffen SS buried there. </sentence><sentence id="4826">And if they had, I don't think he'd have known the difference, unless somebody told him. </sentence><sentence id="4827">I mean, how many people know the difference between the SS of the <span class="populated place">concentration

of like our Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Waffen SS ended up with a lot of regular SS men in it, and they began to do a lot of the things that the -- the occupying forces, the atrocities against the civilian population, and of course the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, the thing [indecipherable] so there was a -- a definite mix, but the president wouldn't have known that. </sentence><sentence id="4830">In fact, I don't think anybody in his staff would have particularly known this, unless somebody told them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
