<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: <span class="building">Johanna Newman</span>, which is a rather difficult name to put on for this <span class="country">country</span> that's what it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I was born uh on December 2nd, 1930, in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And did your parents ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="12">My cousin Stephen was born in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company. </sentence><sentence id="15">Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years. </sentence><sentence id="16">I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="17">She still managed to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">She was in <span class="country">America</span> and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early "60's. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="20"> Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War. </sentence><sentence id="21">She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her. </sentence><sentence id="22">I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh . </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh I did visit these grandparents in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> several times. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm not  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="25"> Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children. </sentence><sentence id="26">have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have. </sentence><sentence id="27">Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="28">They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left <span class="country">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938. </sentence><sentence id="29">She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now <span class="building">school</span> started for me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="31">And I entered <span class="building">school</span>, the school year of 1937, <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> uh called at one time <span class="building">School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">Rather famous for it's <span class="building">girls school</span> of uh high but by the time I went to the <span class="building">school</span> it was no longer called . </sentence><sentence id="33">I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> uh <span class="building">center</span>, <span class="building">community council</span> or whatever it was called in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> when Jewish children no longer could attend <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">And I went to this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">The <span class="building">school</span> was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called <span class="building">Hebrew day school</span>, a half-day uh singular subject and half-days. </sentence><sentence id="36">Unfortunately I only went to that <span class="building">school</span> for about a year and a half before we left <span class="country">Germany</span> but the year and a half I was there were very happy years. </sentence><sentence id="37">I remember my some of the girls that went to <span class="building">school</span> and in particular the daughters of my parents" friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children. </sentence><sentence id="39">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="40">Two daughters and one son. </sentence><sentence id="41">One of the daughters, . </sentence><sentence id="42">The Meyers immigrated with us to <span class="country">Albania</span> and the Millers went to <span class="country">America</span> and , but when I came to <span class="country">America</span> after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the <span class="env feature">clouds</span> over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect. </sentence><sentence id="43">Uh in particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously UhI spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her. </sentence><sentence id="45">Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our <span class="building">home</span> and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="46">And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh and as I say, I think that the first <span class="env feature">clouds</span> that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our <span class="interior space">classroom</span> and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> uh please leave  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48"> deported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="49">Obviously that left some impression on all of us children. </sentence><sentence id="50">I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event. </sentence><sentence id="53">Like every other morning I went to <span class="building">school</span>, and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was sent to <span class="building">school</span> like every other morning, and my way to <span class="building">school</span> passed a big uh <span class="building">Synagogue</span>, the center of ,Jewish life in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">And in fact the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big <span class="building">synagogue</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent <span class="spatial object">exhibits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">I think the place where the <span class="building">synagogue</span> stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="58">But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to <span class="building">school</span>, and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and throwing stones </sentence></p><p><sentence id="59"> <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the place itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming. </sentence><sentence id="61">I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there </sentence></p><p><sentence id="62"> and throwing stones into the <span class="dlf">stained glass windows</span> was enough to make us and arrived at <span class="building">school</span> and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="63">We should remain calm and we wouldn't have <span class="building">school</span> that day. </sentence><sentence id="64">And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's <span class="building">home</span> where my father already was. </sentence><sentence id="65">And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the <span class="building">synagogues</span> all through <span class="country">Germany</span> had been set on fire, destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="66">were burned in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="67">It is known that in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> sacrificed themselves to run into the <span class="building">synagogue</span> to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh that the had been demolished. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="69">merchandise had been thrown into the <span class="dlf">streets</span> covered with <span class="env feature">water</span> and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction. </sentence><sentence id="70">Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the <span class="region">downtown area</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">He came back . </sentence><sentence id="72">In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh <span class="building">police stations</span> and eventually ended up in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh concentration <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">I'm not sure whether <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> was already in existence but <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and were. </sentence><sentence id="74">And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="75"> and he had arrived at <span class="building">work</span> and was immediately taken by the police to . </sentence><sentence id="76">We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="77"> this was a <span class="spatial object">pogram</span> (ph) that would last for an entire week. </sentence><sentence id="78">We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="79">And at night we did go <span class="building">home</span> uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own <span class="building">home</span> and he was not going to be intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="80">And we did go <span class="building">home</span> that evening and uh slept in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">I don't believe that too much happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="82">They may have knocked on our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">We didn't answer uh the <span class="dlf">door</span>, but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="84">Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of <span class="populated place">town</span> and I'm not sure how they made their way, to <span class="building">summer resort</span> called . </sentence><sentence id="85">It's outside of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was the for being prepared for uh <span class="country">Palestine</span> at that time, and also a <span class="building">children's home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">In fact I spent one summer there as a child. </sentence><sentence id="88">And uh this uh was surrounded by a <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">Maybe the nights too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="90"> for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91"> that was there. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people. </sentence><sentence id="93">All kinds of gloves for different professions. </sentence><sentence id="94">And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at <span class="building">home</span>, which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the <span class="building">Museum</span> is interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="95">Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="96">And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in <span class="country">Germany</span>, across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this <span class="building">business</span> that he had built up in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in <span class="country">Germany</span>, his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="97">Uh Jews were no longer allowed to . </sentence><sentence id="98">Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="99">It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as "39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="100">And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name. </sentence><sentence id="101">All women became Sarah and all men became <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter. </sentence><sentence id="103">And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name. </sentence><sentence id="104">And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the <span class="spatial object">Iron Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">He had received in 1935 a <span class="spatial object">cross</span> which was given only to all <span class="dlf">front line</span> fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the <span class="dlf">front line</span>, and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out. </sentence><sentence id="107">I mean that was something . [ </sentence><sentence id="108">believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="109">Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="110"> obviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life. </sentence><sentence id="111">I'm a child. </sentence><sentence id="112">I'm panic- stricken or very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="113">The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms . </sentence><sentence id="115">Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh <span class="building">shelter</span>, even at that stage of the game. </sentence><sentence id="116">But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out. </sentence><sentence id="117">And we had to stay in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">The sirens would go. </sentence><sentence id="119">The uh uh <span class="building">fire department</span> would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear. </sentence><sentence id="120">I mean I can feel that fear even today. </sentence><sentence id="121">I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went <span class="building">home</span> to uh back to our own <span class="interior space">apartment</span> Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken. </sentence><sentence id="122">I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean. </sentence><sentence id="123">And the tremendous fear . </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, "36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="125"> and these would be broadcast on the <span class="building">radio stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And people would put on their </sentence></p><p><sentence id="127"> <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, and I remember but this must have been summer time. </sentence><sentence id="128"><span class="interior space">Windows</span> were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again. </sentence><sentence id="129">I could feel it like I felt  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="130"> thorough job, so I'm sure that I can go back much further. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh my father's family even though he was born in which was the heart of <span class="region">Prussia</span>, uh under American law after the after the uh Ist World War it had been ceased (ph) to <span class="country">Poland</span> and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to <span class="country">America</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="132">But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German. </sentence><sentence id="133">And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="134">Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the in the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place. </sentence><sentence id="135">I I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="136">But nevertheless this was the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="137">So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota. </sentence><sentence id="138">My mother and I both having been born in <span class="country">Germany</span> had not, no great problems. </sentence><sentence id="139">The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for <span class="country">America</span> several times before leaving for <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">I think we were called to the <span class="building">Consule</span> at least twice if not three times. </sentence><sentence id="141">However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier. </sentence><sentence id="142">And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead. </sentence><sentence id="143">I believe did. </sentence><sentence id="144">So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">They had to also find another <span class="building">asylum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">And it was exactly that. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was a search for an <span class="building">asylum</span> no matter where. </sentence><sentence id="148">And uh the <span class="dlf">passibilities</span> were very very slim. </sentence><sentence id="149">They thought of <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">Well <span class="country">England</span> required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="151">I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">Was very difficult to get into <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove. </sentence><sentence id="155">He was a business man, through and through. </sentence><sentence id="156">So that was out. </sentence><sentence id="157">So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this <span class="country">Albania</span> uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to <span class="country">Germany</span> at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go ona honey...his honeymoon to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money. </sentence><sentence id="159">He got us in return, perhaps not in return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery. </sentence><sentence id="160">I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="162">At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> back to her would have been absolute uh disaster. </sentence><sentence id="163">I mean how does anybody go into an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before. </sentence><sentence id="165">At any rate we did get visas. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh and uh now the process of leaving <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> mysteriously began. </sentence><sentence id="167">My recollections on that are very very sad. </sentence><sentence id="168">Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's. </sentence><sentence id="169">Today I'm pretty close to that and I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="171">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="172"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173"> consider myself not an old person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like <span class="country">Albania</span> and this is all we knew about <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">Uh she was left alone in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> with an older sister. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to <span class="country">America</span> were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="176">I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">That was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="179">Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">We had to give up our things. </sentence><sentence id="181">We had to give our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh and we thought that we would go to <span class="country">Albania</span>, transfer our documents with the <span class="building">American Consule</span> to the <span class="building">American Consule</span> in , which indeed we did and that we would go to <span class="country">Albania</span> for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year. </sentence><sentence id="183">Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long. </sentence><sentence id="184">Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, it was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="186">We're not allowed to take out any silver. </sentence><sentence id="187">We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="188">Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="189">We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased. </sentence><sentence id="190">I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="191">I believe that in my papers at <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Haifa</span> I even have lists of things my parents took with them. </sentence><sentence id="192">I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="193">I mean everything was made very clear. </sentence><sentence id="194">They packed a <span class="spatial object">lift</span> (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials. </sentence><sentence id="195">Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these <span class="spatial object">lifts</span> were left in the storage of the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in <span class="country">America</span> we would send for these <span class="spatial object">lifts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your <span class="spatial object">lift</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span>, and it makes sense, because I think the <span class="country">United States</span>, or the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> of <span class="populated place">New York</span> would have been flooded with <span class="spatial object">lifts</span> of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there. </sentence><sentence id="197">So our <span class="spatial object">lift</span> was left in uh <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, in the uh <span class="dlf">harbor</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, and uh we left <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="198">At least this is what the official exit document that I have states. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him. </sentence><sentence id="201">These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war. </sentence><sentence id="202">Uh his younger brother had fallen for <span class="country">Germany</span> eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919. </sentence><sentence id="204">She had gone to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to wait for him as he arrived. </sentence><sentence id="205">He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into <span class="country">Russia</span> and never came back from the war until February 1919. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh she was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">She awaited him at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza. </sentence><sentence id="209">She went back to <span class="populated place">Posen</span> and died very shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="210">And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier. </sentence><sentence id="211"><span class="populated place">Posen</span> by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into <span class="populated place">Posen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="214">It is

that uh all whoever was left in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the <span class="building">building</span> where we lived, that he could use the <span class="interior space">furnace room</span> of the <span class="building">house</span> and burn all what he couldn't take with him. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Papers, documents, etc. </sentence><sentence id="220">etc. </sentence><sentence id="221">He took some things with him, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="222">We were so limited in our <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> and our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the <span class="building">house</span> that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along. </sentence><sentence id="224">The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us. </sentence><sentence id="226">One for each of us, and nothing more. </sentence><sentence id="227">And her jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="228">When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along. </sentence><sentence id="230">They were pa...that is to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us. </sentence><sentence id="231">Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this place, packed in a sealed little package. </sentence><sentence id="232">I still see the <span class="spatial object">package</span> in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was very small and it was sealed with <span class="spatial object">seal-locker</span>, actually sealed, and I guess included was a list of items that were in it. </sentence><sentence id="234">And a copy of that list, when we finally left <span class="country">Germany</span> and crossed the <span class="dlf">Pass</span> into <span class="country">Italy</span>, that list was over there with the customs official, officials. </sentence><sentence id="235">My parents were taken out of the <span class="spatial

that they had received. </sentence><sentence id="236">That's how strict things were handled in those days. </sentence><sentence id="237">At any rate, the day of departure arrived. </sentence><sentence id="238">I remember all night long my parents were still packing. </sentence><sentence id="239">I remember the last night in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="241">I still re...see her standing on her <span class="interior

traveled to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and slept the first night in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and continued the next day to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">That is to say we crossed the <span class="dlf">Pass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the <span

one <span class="interior space">room</span> and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the <span class="spatial

look, some people smuggled things out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="253">That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was money smuggled

ended up for many years in <span class="building">prison</span>, and uh we left with the ten marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="261">We left with the little package that was packaged in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, and that's all we had with us. </sentence><sentence id="262">We arrived in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> and really didn't know where to turn. </sentence><sentence id="263">To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of <span class="country">Italy</span>, and apparently in many such <span class="populated place">centers</span> of uh <span class="populated place">cities</span> where <span class="spatial object">trains</span> would come from <span class="country">Germany</span>, these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in <span class="country">America</span>, and the same went for the Meyer family. </sentence><sentence id="266">Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went. </sentence><sentence id="267">But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> who also took us around <span class="populated place">town</span>, showed us <span class="populated place">Bologne</span>, fed us, took us to <span class="building">restaurants</span>, and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh <span class="dlf">passage</span> for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> to <span class="populated place">Bari</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="268">In <span class="populated place">Bari</span> we took a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two <span class="spatial object">tripls</span>, because this was out of <span class="region">territorial Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">They would not allow us to pay with German money in <span class="country">Germany</span> for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called. </sentence><sentence id="272">And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back. </sentence><sentence id="273">Of course it never did. </sentence><sentence id="274">By the way, speaking of the <span class="spatial object">lift</span> in in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the <span class="building">German court</span> somehow found out that uh indeed there was a <span class="spatial object">lift</span> stored in a certain man's uh <span class="building">warehouse</span> uh which had been distributed. </sentence><sentence id="275">The contents of not only our <span class="spatial object">lift</span> but I suppose many other people's uh <span class="spatial object">lifts</span>, had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early "60's as compensation for the <span class="spatial object">lift</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">Anyway, we're now uh in uh <span class="populated place">Bologne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , . </sentence><sentence id="279">She writes about the Italian Jews and <span class="country">Italy</span> and its Jews, etd. </sentence><sentence id="280">It's a fantastic book I think. </sentence><sentence id="281">Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention <span class="country">Albania</span> at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in. </sentence><sentence id="282">Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about <span class="country">Albania</span> and the Italian role there. </sentence><sentence id="283">But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the <span class="dlf">border</span> to make their life more pleasant and easier. </sentence><sentence id="284">And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="285">Anyway, we now leave for <span class="populated place">Bari</span>, and immediately take uh a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and the money that we could afford was only for sturge

class="dlf">site</span> that uh we saw was one of extreme depression. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was a one <span class="dlf">dock</span> and <span class="dlf">port</span>, piles and piles, heaps and heaps of charcoal on the <span class="dlf">pier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was pouring rain. </sentence><sentence id="300">The <span class="env feature">black water</span> was everywhere, running all over the <span class="dlf">pier</span> from the charcoal. </sentence><sentence id="301">There were few uh Albanians, for the most part gypsies because they use...used to use gypsies for their heavy work and for carrying and so on. </sentence><sentence id="302">Covering their, and this I kept seeing it all through the years whenever it rained, these people would use as a protection just the <span class="spatial object">jute bags</span> over their heads and this is was the sight that met our eyes. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was really really depressing. </sentence><sentence id="304">And I remember my mother crying bitterly and saying I am not leaving this <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="305">I am going to straight back to . </sentence><sentence id="306">She absolutely could not envision how she would ever be able to set foot to this kind of a unbelievably depressing uh sight. </sentence><sentence id="307">Well again to our surprise, because we really had no idea what was expecting us in <span class="country">Albania</span>, uh there were other immigrants, European immigrants already in <span class="country">Albania</span>, and someone from the <span class="dlf">pier</span> called up in German, are there any German Jews, are there any Jews on <span class="spatial object">board</span>? </sentence><sentence id="308">And uh we were very happy that this gentleman who had already been in <span class="country">Albania</span>, this was his job to be there every day when <span class="spatial object">boats</span> arrived to see whether there would be refugees on these <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">And uh so he helped us get off the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and uh take us to one of the local <span class="building">hotels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">Well ho...<span class="building">hotel</span> is an overstatement of facts, but that's what they were called. </sentence><sentence id="311">Exceeding...everything was exceedingly primative. </sentence><sentence id="312">Uh we had, coming from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, uh hygiene being the epitomy of our lives and so on, this was really unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="313">But nevertheless here we were. </sentence><sentence id="314">Uh I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="315">We children perhaps because of our age, by this time I had just turned my eighth birthday in December before we left, and uh the uh children of the family Meyer, one was younger - I believe he was only five - and uh the other, the the girls - one was a year older than myself and one was exactly the same age. </sentence><sentence id="316">So I don't know ta what extent we could empathasize with the feeling our parents experienced. </sentence><sentence id="317">I think that to us some of this was exciting because it was new and it was different and and it was just all uh a new experience for us children. </sentence><sentence id="318">I think at this point we uh we were certainly very insecure because we didn't know what was facing us or what <span class="building">school</span> would be like or the usual things that children do - <span class="spatial object">toys</span>, we had almost none with us, just what we could carry in our arms or our little bag that each one of us had over their shoulder, and uh I do remember very well that for many many years the one thing that I missed so terribly was my <span class="spatial object">school bag</span>, and I always had in the back of my mind, well one day when I get to live in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, my <span class="spatial object">school bag</span> was . </sentence><sentence id="319">In <span class="country">Germany</span> we used to wear the <span class="spatial object">school bag</span> on your on your back. </sentence><sentence id="320">I had some particular like for this I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't know exactly why, but that was so important to me that I did not have that with me. </sentence><sentence id="322">Uh another thing I had received as a gift from an uncle of my mother's a <span class="building">doll house</span> that he had made himself and of couse I had to leave that behind, needless to say, and that was a tremendous uh and I missed it very badly. </sentence><sentence id="323">Well, these are the things that children of that age I think we experiencing. </sentence><sentence id="324">The lack of the uh ususal, the schooling, the friends, the <span class="interior space">playgrounds</span>, the <span class="spatial object">toys</span>, the family the grandparents, etc. </sentence><sentence id="325">Uh but the other insecurities of where does the next meal come from or where are we going to live and where are we going to sleep and so on which parents have to worry about, I think that didn't quite trickle down to us at that point yet. </sentence><sentence id="326">At any rate we lived in a <span class="building">hotel</span>, so called <span class="building">hotel</span>, very filthy, very dir...very much infested by bedbugs and lice and the whole gambit, and uh the other immigrants and there were at that point I believe something like sixty people there. </sentence><sentence id="327">They were all from <span class="country">Austria</span>, mostly This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="328">It is

id="331">There were Albanian Jews and that is to say there were two families originally from <span class="country">Greece</span> who had lived for many years in <span class="country">Albania</span> and they were considered Albanian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh there names were uh Kohn (ph) and Levy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="333">They ran rather large <span class="building">dry goods stores</span> and uh they were weal...very Jews. </sentence><sentence id="334">Their origin as I say was from <span class="populated place">Solonika</span> (ph) I believe and uh when these other people had arrived a little bit earlier than we, I don't believe that anybody was there more than maybe a year longer than we. </sentence><sentence id="335">In other words in 1938 I believe is immigration to <span class="country">Albania</span> started. </sentence><sentence id="336">Uh these people had sort of assumed the role of uh to the highest to the <span class="dlf">Joint Distribution</span> in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">Made contact with them, and they were sending American dollars to these two families who in turn gave us the Albanian equivalent of this money. </sentence><sentence id="338">But in all these years they made very nice uh currency out of these Jews that came to to to escape <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">Never mind. </sentence><sentence id="340">At any rate uh these people had organized themselves in uh they had rented a very very large <span class="building">house</span>, call it a uh a <span class="building">hostel</span>, and uh these sixty people, more or less, were living, a <span class="interior space">room</span> per family, in this <span class="building">house</span> with a very hugh <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, <span class="interior space">communal kitchen</span> of course, and uh they had uh organized in such a way that several women each day would take turns at cooking and preparing the food and several men would take turns every day in purchasing uh the produce etc. </sentence><sentence id="341">and prepare the two meals. </sentence><sentence id="342">They were in the process of renting a second such <span class="building">hostel</span> right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the first one but had not completed the arrangements yet so that we for example uh had no <span class="interior space">room</span> in the original <span class="building">home</span>, and had to live in this <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">So it was us and uh the Meyer family and there were a couple of other couples or single people who in the meantime were staying in one or the other of these <span class="building">hotels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">I think at that time there were just two. ( ) </sentence><sentence id="345">One was called .The other one was called, and uh but for meals we had to go everyday to this <span class="building">hostel</span> which was perhaps not a long way. </sentence><sentence id="346">I don't really recall. </sentence><sentence id="347">I do recall that as a child it was a trecherous waly to walk. </sentence><sentence id="348">You have to remember that uh <span class="dlf">roads</span> as such weren't reallly known in <span class="country">Albania</span> and it was all very uh muddy. </sentence><sentence id="349">This was the rainy season in February and March into April, and uh we had to go twice a day for meals to the <span class="building">home</span>, to the uh <span class="building">hostel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">And it wasn't until a few months later, and I'm not quite sure exactly whether it was May or June that the second <span class="building">hostel</span> had been rented and when we could move, be moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="351">OK. </sentence><sentence id="352">Uh so this us procedure here went on all through March and into April. </sentence><sentence id="353">April 5th, 1939, we woke up to a barrage of <span class="spatial object">cannon</span> uh shots. </sentence><sentence id="354">And we didn't quite know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="355">We were told immediately that the royal family had just uh the Queen of <span class="country">Albania</span> had just delivered a uh an heir to the throne and uh they were shooting . </sentence><sentence id="356">Well that was very nice and the King of <span class="country">Albania</span>, King uh offered that these sixty or maybe by now sixty-five or seventy immigrants Albanian citizenship in honor of the birth of his son.

</sentence><sentence id="558">They were pretty serious. </sentence><sentence id="559">It was a living for us for a good number of years, at least two, two, two and a half years and uh my parents

it is such a very typical story. </sentence><sentence id="622">We were her so-called <span class="building">court</span> Jews. </sentence><sentence id="623">She was such a strong supporter of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="624">In her <span class="interior space">living room</span> she had a tremendous colored portrait of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="625">Her, she came from which is the

kinds of esctasy describing this ( ) phenomenal human being that this Hitler was and so on. </sentence><sentence id="627">But she was Albanian and she lived in <span class="country">Italy</span>, I

uh when the chips were down, that is to say in 1943 when uh, well I don't have to repeat the history which is already known, but eventually the Germans regarded the Italians as their enemies and they actually occupied <span class="country">Albania</span>, and uh to the extent where they deported the Italians by <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, via back into <span

dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="631">We were in <span class="populated place">Duratso</span> - oh, I have really skipped something that is most important, and where the family came in very much. </sentence><sentence id="632">Uh a little bit earlier on, I suppose it must have been - well, let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="633">I I'm afraid we have to go back to 1942. </sentence><sentence id="634">In 1942, first of all the Germans are occupying <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, and a group of maybe approximately a hundred Yugoslave Jews accomp...came across the <span

to uh deliver the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span>, or things of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="675">We always had the dog with us, as little as she was, but our uh landlord did two things. </sentence><sentence id="676">One, he had a big German Shepherd dog who that night was away from the <span class="building">house</span> because they never fed the dog and the dog all night long used to roam around finding food, but from here on in, he put the dog on a uh uh <span class="dlf">wire</span> that ran around the <span class="building">house</span> and uh fed the dog well. </sentence><sentence id="677">And the other thing was he made a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in our, between our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and his so that in case something like
