yes, DKs laid up[ph], one of the <span class="building">school</span> mates remembered this incident and it made a deep impression on him of course because it was so weird, it was so odd, but it made a very strong impression on me, which I remember to this day. </sentence><sentence id="22">It gave me some kind of, you know, spiritual base, not in a religious term, I respect very much my grandfather and my uncle's and my father to stand by their traditions and not to succumb, you know, to fear and what not and simply go through with this procession as it should be done. </sentence><sentence id="23">And I must say that very often I have been in all kinds of strange situations, I've been reminded of this because these people, they, you know, you couldn't, they were not, they were not, doubtful about, they may have lost, slowly lost their religious feeling, but as Jews to remit very proud, very full of self assurance; which made it easier for them to become , because if you stand by your culture the , will respect you for what you are. </sentence><sentence id="24">But if you start, you know, being wishy-washy and you lose your culture background it becomes more difficult for you to be accepted and integrated in , culture. </sentence><sentence id="25">Jewish culture and other national cultures go very well together because the Jewish culture of Tereshney[ph] was spiritual culture, not nationally, not nationally, rooted in a special <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">That what is said about Jewish living, you know, the new Jews almost thought(ph), that this was something in the <span class="dlf">heaven</span>, I mean, it was not through(ph) the Turkish Jews living in <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">So this is, I want to relate one more incident which is, which is, told to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="28">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="29"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection me a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this <span class="building">elementary school</span>, this schoolmate, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came probably two or three generations before us. </sentence><sentence id="30">They came from a place in <span class="country">Germany</span> called <span class="populated place">Desow</span> (ph) and the name of the family to this day remains <span class="populated place">Desow</span> (ph) and he told me when we met by chance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my mother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious relationship between me and the color brown , can't stand it, but that is how it was imposed on you, so I even dressed up in brown, what do you call it, special weaving, uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: How did that effect your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Well, you know, interesting that they Germans made a deal with the Danish Government. </sentence><sentence id="80">So, when the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance because they didn't want to listen to the orders from the superiors to lay down their arms. </sentence><sentence id="81">But in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="82">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="83"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Janisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral <span class="country">Denmark</span> and <span class="country">Denmark</span> had to know that of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. </sentence><sentence id="84">But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. </sentence><sentence id="85"><span class="building">Demark</span> succumbed, made a deal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews because that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, <span class="region">occupied Europe</span>, because the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to say, sharing of, sharing of authority. </sentence><sentence id="86">The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on with their normal lives. </sentence><sentence id="87">Political parties were non-functioning, the <span class="building">parliament</span> went on giving laws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the <span class="populated place">town</span> followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply situation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="88">We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections <span class="country">Denmark</span> during the German occupation and the last one, the Nazi party, was simply trashed and the Germans didn't, didn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="89">The Germans on their side of course wanted the Danes(ph) to let the Germans go on, so to say, building <span class="building">fortresses</span> along the <span class="region">west coast</span> to protect against a possible allied invasion and <span class="country">Denmark</span> was supposed to be kind of supplying people for the Germans so the last part of the agricultural production(ph) went to the German army and the last part of the industrial production went to, so <span class="country">Denmark</span> as a matter of fact became kind of unwilling, but still partner to the German war effort, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Let me ask you about the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> and your family in particular. </sentence><sentence id="104">Did they feel threatened, vulnerable, did they feel... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: no, no, no... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: They felt protected by the Danes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Well the Danish government, this of course we did not know, but we know today. </sentence><sentence id="112">The Danish government told the Germans that there were a number of <span class="dlf">red lines</span> which the Germans were supposed to respect in order to protect Danish sovreignty. </sentence><sentence id="113">One of the <span class="dlf">red lines</span> was that no This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="114">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="115"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection distinction between Danish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="116">Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no interference with Jewish life at the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, the <span class="building">synagogues</span> were operating the <span class="building">schools</span>, were operating the <span class="building">old age homes</span>, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. </sentence><sentence id="117">I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the <span class="populated place">community</span>, intermarriage between the <span class="populated place">communities</span> and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty <span class="interior space">space</span>, we didn't have information. </sentence><sentence id="118">We could hear pbe of course, but pbe didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span> for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. </sentence><sentence id="119">Being persuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. </sentence><sentence id="120">In the <span class="populated place">Danish community</span>, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would resign and the Germans would have to run the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">The Germans at that time did not necessarily have the desire to turn this <span class="country">country</span> which was serving their ends into a hostile <span class="country">country</span> which they would have to occupy with tens of thousands of soldiers which they needed somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="122">So there was kind of a balance based on communal interest, the Danish wanted to run the <span class="country">country</span> safely out of the war the Germans wanted to have as much peace as possible to concentrate their efforts in another <span class="region">front</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Were there Jews who went into the resistance, the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: I wanted to come to this because one of the things that was posted on us was not to get involved with the emerging resistance, don't get the resistance started, acting to be a popular movement only after the mid or end 1943. </sentence><sentence id="140">Until then resistance was some groups committing small sabotage acts, publishing newspapers, but it was not something which the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="141">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="142"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="143">Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, but didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. </sentence><sentence id="144">People bother, but they have no effect on the German war effort. </sentence><sentence id="145">So, we were told don't join them. </sentence><sentence id="146">Now I was at that time at the age of 15 and of course I joined them. </sentence><sentence id="147">If people told me not to do it and it happened so that the famous communist , it was a schoolmate of mine. </sentence><sentence id="148">We started selling illegal newspapers and books published by the emerging resistance in order to finance their activities, they sold these books to <span class="interior space">underground</span> of course, it was banned by the Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">The Danes in order to prevent annoying the Germans too much, so one of the books I remember was by John Steinbeck. </sentence><sentence id="150">He was a part of the German occupation of <span class="country">Norway</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="151">He write, not a very sophisticated book, what it was, it served the purpose of these times. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, we were and of course the first thing you did was to settle to your family, but at any rate this was discolored by my father who was a member of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community agencies, member of the board or something. </sentence><sentence id="153">So of course he was more exposed(ph) than others because the Germans, as you know, that there had been always before going for the Jews in the <span class="populated place">community</span> to take all the members of the leadership of the community simply to deprive the rest of the Jews from any leadership. </sentence><sentence id="154">This is the way they used to handle it. </sentence><sentence id="155">So my father was very unnerved, you've got to do this because that might put me, the family, the <span class="populated place">community</span> in a very sensitive dangerous position. </sentence><sentence id="156">And I didn't want to listen to my father and he of course, what do you do, you call the chief Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="157">At that time chief Rabbis were not administrators of community affairs. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were people, imposing people with beards, you know and supposed to harbor a certain amount of wisdom. </sentence><sentence id="159">So I was told to go to the chief Rabbi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: This is Fleetiger(ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: His name was Max Fleetiger(ph). </sentence><sentence id="187">He was originally from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">He spoke in the Danish language, but of course speaking with a heavy Hungarian accent. </sentence><sentence id="189">Later he was taken by the Germans and brought to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and survived and came back This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="190">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="191"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection into the <span class="populated place">community</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="192">But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you remember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the typing, I remember that I was asked to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="193">I was standing up and he was sitting behind a huge <span class="spatial object">desk</span> with his , his and had a beard like or square, long beard, very well groomed, but you know. </sentence><sentence id="194">They told me that they, he ordered me to give up all this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans catch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of our <span class="populated place">community</span> in danger. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, give it up. </sentence><sentence id="196">The moment that you have been told that you have the responsibility for a whole <span class="populated place">community</span> and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it up. </sentence><sentence id="197">So I went <span class="building">home</span> and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="198">That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately after. </sentence><sentence id="199">But you know that in 1943, August there was a clash between the Danes and the German interest and to put it shortly the Danes resigned and the Danish Government retired and the <span class="building">Parliament</span> went <span class="building">home</span> the King went into exile in his <span class="building">castle</span> and the Shee(ph) which has protected us from German encroachment was removed overnight. </sentence><sentence id="200">Suddenly there were only Germans and us. </sentence><sentence id="201">The Germans didn't have to anymore consider this deal about you stick to your things and we'll stick to our things and the Jewish we are leaving behind. </sentence><sentence id="202">So at that time, 1943 August, about half of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> of <span class="country">Europe</span> had been destroyed by the holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="203">We didn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, the <span class="populated place">community</span> did not try to build up kind of work preparing us. </sentence><sentence id="204">We were, we were__, remember my father went to the Director of the <span class="building">Foreign Ministry</span>, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the situation had changed dramatically and that of course would change our situation, but we just didn't know how and he went to the Director of <span class="building">Foreign Ministry</span>, who was living in the neighboring <span class="building">house</span> and he asked me what's new so he said, don't worry, I have contact with the Germans all of the time and if anything is cropping up, we will warn you, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="205">Well, of course something cropped up, mainly the German Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="206">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="207"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and he never warned us. </sentence><sentence id="208">I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. </sentence><sentence id="209">We escaped of course and came back a couple of years(ph) later from <span class="country">Sweden</span> and right after our return my parents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry, you didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. </sentence><sentence id="210">Now, whether they heard anything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being faced with this old preach of promise. </sentence><sentence id="211">But many, many years later when I was serving as chief editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___.(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our staff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out of the limelight. </sentence><sentence id="212">I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter. </sentence><sentence id="213">He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="214">These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back from <span class="building">refuge</span> in <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for having broken his promise. </sentence><sentence id="216">Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. </sentence><sentence id="217">At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="218">At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. </sentence><sentence id="219">The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="220">Well it's a long story, but the Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with the mark in their hands and . </sentence><sentence id="221">Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three <span class="spatial object">ships</span> to come from <span class="country">Germany</span> and anchor in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="224">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="225"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection dishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="226">Of course they were arrested and kept against the constitution. </sentence><sentence id="227">Anyhow, the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to <span class="country">Germany</span> or to <span class="country">Poland</span>, whatever they planned to do. </sentence><sentence id="228">But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="230">But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. </sentence><sentence id="231">For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in the <span class="building">German embassy</span> . </sentence><sentence id="232">A fellow who was a Nazi too, his name was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, Tuckawitz, told about the approaching, German, German, action, I guess the Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a member of the German Nazi party, an early member of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="233">Best was much earlier, Best was one of the evil spirits of the <span class="building">police department</span> of the emerging Nazi party even before the two powers divides(ph) into three. </sentence><sentence id="234">Really, really a war criminal. </sentence><sentence id="235">He was not ever condemned to death, he should have been, for the reason that he let the secret slip and this was used by his defense to protect him against a life sentence after, death sentence after the war. </sentence><sentence id="236">But <span class="populated place">Tuckawitz</span> was kind of a reformed Nazi and he became close, he was a neighbor, commercial, commercial. </sentence><sentence id="237">He had been with Camaris the head of the German intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="238"><span class="building">Camaris</span>, <span class="building">C-A-M-A-R-I-S</span> who is by the way execute(ph) by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="239">He had been with him at this job at the <span class="building">German embassy</span> and was to prepare the German occupation of <span class="country">Denmark</span> in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="240">But he remained here and established very close contact with the leaderships of the socialcratic party and became embarked with them and started to distancing himself from the Nazi ideology. </sentence><sentence id="241">Of course especially the anti-Jewish part of it and that when Best tipped him off saying that this day the

you didn't speak to any strangers, you're afraid of moving on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> because you were afraid of ending up in the arms of German patrol, there were Germans all over the place, soldiers mainly. </sentence><sentence id="966">Only later we know that the army decided not to interfere, not to take part in the acts against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="967">So the German army for its own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews, wanted to protect the Jews, but simply for its own interests the German army only had one case that's known to have participated in this anti- Jewish action. </sentence><sentence id="968">This was left to the police and the, what do you call it, the visheyesteins(ph), the what the German counter intelligence, whatever it is the, Estit(ph), it's called Estit(ph). </sentence><sentence id="969">So the very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere. </sentence><sentence id="970">This we couldn't have known either.

pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="975">But anyhow, the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> appears from the darkness and we are all already to jump at the <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="977">I don't know, but we were standing out there in the darkness without any alternative. </sentence><sentence id="978">So we returned to the fisherman and we really did not, my father was responsible for the family. </sentence><sentence id="979">These were times when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know what to do, we all relied on the fisherman getting some kind

</sentence><sentence id="1016">And suddenly the <span class="dlf">door</span> opened, I remember this vividly because you are on the edge, you're on the way of getting out of this horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Then the guy, the student, who was supposed to take us came in and we saw that blood was running down his palms and he said to my parents so we had to go back to . </sentence><sentence id="1018">Then the next day, suddenly the <span class="dlf">door</span> bell rings, we of course are like mice scurrying around hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I remember one of my brother hide a my father had hidden under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1020">A very undignified situation today, it's very hard to remember. </sentence><sentence id="1021">You know, that parents at that time were, had different stature(ph) then they do today. </sentence><sentence id="1022">For instance, in our <span class="interior

away. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Another thing that I remember so vividly is some very painful memory is that when we finally got on our way and found a reliable <span class="dlf">escape route</span> it was the day after. </sentence><sentence id="1024">We run through a <span class="env feature">forest</span> at night, single file of course, the father in front. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Suddenly my father slipped on a <span class="dlf">route</span> or a <span class="dlf">branch</span> and fell. </sentence><sentence id="1026">This was the fall of, this was the fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he was always in control, the provider, the protector, suddenly seeing him in a situation with this falling you know at the time when the whole family was relying on him, you know, this is something which still today can give me the creeps. </sentence><sentence id="1027">But at any rate, the <span class="dlf">door</span> bell rang and the fisherman went out to answer the <span class="dlf">door</span>, because in those days if you didn't open the <span class="dlf">door</span>, they would break in. </sentence><sentence id="1028">At any rate, if you didn't open the <span class="dlf">door</span>, as I said, they would break them in. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So he went out and opening the <span class="dlf">door</span> and a voice asked, as we heard from

and said, "yes we are." </sentence><sentence id="1034">He took a chance because we were without and turned to chances. </sentence><sentence id="1035">The guy comes in, another business friend of my fathers, who by the way his son was collaborated with the German Nazis, a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And this guy, by the way, he way limping, walking with a stick.

seen the Pundik family?" </sentence><sentence id="1038">He couldn't know if we had escaped already, but he simply, you know, that is the way that people had to act it was a moral imperative for them to act, so he did this impossible thing and found a needle in the haystack. </sentence><sentence id="1039">He went along the <span class="env feature">coast</span> asking, he knocked on the <span
