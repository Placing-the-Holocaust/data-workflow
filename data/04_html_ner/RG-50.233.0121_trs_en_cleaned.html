<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Well, you had absolutely nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="22">You tolerated but you were definitely disgusted about this and we were trying to make some sort of ironic remarks all the time during the <span class="spatial object">classes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">But our teachers were army officers and they were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: That was in January? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: That was January 1940. </sentence><sentence id="63">Taking advantage of -- they gave us two weeks vacation. </sentence><sentence id="64">So arriving to this last <span class="building">station</span> I had to go about five miles on foot with a group of some people. </sentence><sentence id="65">They thought I know more about the location of the <span class="dlf">border line</span> than themselves. </sentence><sentence id="66">And I led them directly to the <span class="building">guards building</span> and when we started running away, they noticed us and they started shooting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: These were the Russian guards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Russian guards and I was caught first time when I tried to cross the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">And as penalty they placed us in the <span class="building">brick outhouse</span> in the <span class="interior space">lower level</span> where I had to stand in excrement, human excrement up to my knees. </sentence><sentence id="76">So I couldn't kneel. </sentence><sentence id="77">I couldn't relax, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="78">I had to stand there for three days before they took us out and they told us, now go back to <span class="populated place">Wilaka</span> and you should study because you are a young student and you will be a good Consumer (?). </sentence><sentence id="79">Then I cried but I had to try again. </sentence><sentence id="80">So with my second try, instead of turning left, I turned right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you go all the way back to <span class="populated place">Wilaka</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: NO, NO, NO, NO. </sentence><sentence id="91">Right after this maybe I went two kilometers towards the <span class="building">station</span> and then I turned sideways when I noticed, because that was during the night, I noticed they couldn't see me anymore and I tried again, with the help, of course, of one guy who was also <span class="dlf">crossing</span> not the first time. </sentence><sentence id="92">And he helped me out and I found myself on the other side in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="93">People on the <span class="region">borderline</span> were very wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="94">They fed me, they washed me a little bit, because I stunk like a beaver. </sentence><sentence id="95">And after a few hours I arrived to <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span> because I thought my grandmother is still in my place where I was born, <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">When I arrived there I only met my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="97">My grandmother was in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="98">So between January of 1940 -- oh while reaching the destination, I sent a message to my mother in <span class="populated place">Wilaka</span> a friend who was leaving for <span class="populated place">Wilno</span> because he had a family over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Was he crossing from the <span class="region">German side</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He was crossing from the <span class="region">German side</span> to the <span class="region">Russian side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">And I give him description how I crossed and I urged them also to try to come over. </sentence><sentence id="112">You see the difference between <span class="region">Russian occupational zone</span> and German was that they were both death enemies of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">However, on the <span class="region">German side</span> you could at least dress as a civilized people. </sentence><sentence id="114">You could use your tie, you could use your hat, you could use your nice shirt, versus looking like a peasant all the time and be completely as a savage looking. </sentence><sentence id="115">So this is, you should remember, this is the reason why so many people couldn't stand Communists because that was hypocrisy to the highest extent. </sentence><sentence id="116">Now what struck me first on my arrival to <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span> that Jewish people, they were wearing the armbands with the Star of David and they had to take hats off and step aside before every German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="117">So you could see that that was horrible experience right from the start. </sentence><sentence id="118">And I was wondering right then how long I would be safe in this <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Did anybody ever check your documents at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How would you clean the mortar off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: With chisels, and once you cleaned a thousand bricks a day, you had good pay. </sentence><sentence id="148">And so I worked there, but it was too hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="149">So after two months, that was about March, in March I met one friend who suggested to me we should open photographic business because Germans were taking pictures of all the Polish ruins and Polish various <span class="building">monuments</span> and everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Had the Germans assigned you to that task of cleaning up the <span class="building">buildings</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: In your <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Did you actually have a <span class="building">store</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: We had a <span class="building">store</span>, yeah, we had a <span class="building">store</span> in a half demolished <span class="building">building</span>, but it was okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: That's extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="188">What about getting supplies? </sentence><sentence id="189">Was it relatively... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: The Germans were giving you supplies. </sentence><sentence id="194">The Germans were bringing supplies to your <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">Therefore, you were allowed to charge them just for your labor. </sentence><sentence id="196">They were giving you prices for every print, every enlargement, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="197">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="198">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="199"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: No, no, anybody who was against them who was caught doing something that they -- for everything, as you know maybe, everything was death penalty, no matter what you did, against the <span class="country">Reich</span> it was death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="214">Now, my mother and sister arrived in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> in May 1940.They had also tremendous, tremendous difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="215">They were separated for 48 hours during their trip and my mother thought that they kidnapped my sister because she was only, at that time, maybe twelve years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Were you living with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: I was living with my aunt, yeah, in <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: And that's where the <span class="building">store</span> was, in <span class="populated place">SiedlIce</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: In <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span>, yeah, before my mother and sister arrived. </sentence><sentence id="227">When my mother and sister arrived in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> she sold everything what we had, possibly whatever was available and in their clothing and various pieces of undergarments se sewed in all the bank notes, high bank notes of one thousand zloty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: So we collected, it was a very nice sum, when we tear off all these garment we found quite a nice sum of money. </sentence><sentence id="231">And that was the last day in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to exchange the old Polish money into the general government, they were called general government money. </sentence><sentence id="232">And we decided to open a <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">And then between <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and <span class="populated place">Siedlce</span> is <span class="populated place">Minsk Mazowiecki</span> and we decided to go back to our first <span class="populated place">family town</span> when everybody knew us and we knew that if something goes wrong, we will get help. </sentence><sentence id="234">And therefore the first try was to open a regular <span class="building">general store</span> in <span class="populated place">Minsk Mazowiecki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">And since the only place for the <span class="building">building</span> was in <span class="populated place">suburbs</span> didn't go so well, so therefore my mother obtained somehow lease of the <span class="building">building</span> on the main <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">And she decided to change from <span class="building">general store</span> to <span class="building">delicatessen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">And we had fantastic business. </sentence><sentence id="238">We had fantastic business and I could start attending various classes and getting my education because as you know, once Germans occupied <span class="country">Poland</span>, they liquidated all <span class="building">high schools</span>, <span class="building">lyceums</span>, <span class="building">colleges</span>, and <span class="building">universities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">Only the <span class="building">grammar schools</span> were open because they told us that we are designated as labor force only. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Right, so all you need is a certain level of education. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: Right, they don't need Polish intellectuals anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Were you actually working in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> then or did they suspect any young person? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: That's right, correct. </sentence><sentence id="282">So in November of 1940 being located on the main <span class="dlf">street</span> of <span class="populated place">Minsk Mazowiecki</span> we noticed first movement of German troops toward the <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">Okay, that's important fact. </sentence><sentence id="284">And we were wondering, what the hell for. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Did several <span class="dlf">columns</span> come through your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: So it was almost like rounding up cattle, livestock, getting into a smaller and smaller <span class="region">area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="310">And the same way there were hostages also selected from this kind of engagement. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now between June "41 and August "42 there were continuous <span class="spatial object">Wapanki</span>, continuous arrests, continuous, no matter where. </sentence><sentence id="312">Even <span class="populated place">Minsk Mazowiecki</span> was no more safe anymore. </sentence><sentence id="313">And now one morning, at six o'clock in the morning when I was going to my uncle's <span class="building">house</span> for certain information, I was passing by the Ukrainian SS troops who were stationed at the beginning on the <span class="region">east side</span> of <span class="dlf">Minsk Mazowiecki borderline</span> of the <span class="populated place">township</span> and there were plenty of them, I would say about entire <span class="building">company</span>, about 100 people. </sentence><sentence id="314">I was wondering what happened, and when This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="315">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="316"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I was staying with my uncle because we had business together.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
