August...and October Ist, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah, they had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community. </sentence><sentence id="185">They had all the names, all the addresses of everyone in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, which was about 6,000 Jews and they had.... They knew where they lived, what they did, their business. </sentence><sentence id="186">They had everything. </sentence><sentence id="187">And we were informed in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go <span class="building">home</span> because the Germans are going to round you up the night between the Ist and the 2nd of October. </sentence><sentence id="188">And those who believed it, which most of the people did, we were all scared. </sentence><sentence id="189">They...uh...didn't go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">We all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or where to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="191">Those who didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="192">They were taken, which was a very small percentage anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="193">And they all came back after the war. </sentence><sentence id="194">So we went to our <span class="building">grocer</span> who was a bachelor and he said, "Come to my <span class="building">house</span> and I'll take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="195">So after the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his <span class="building">store</span> bread and butter and cheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="196">He took care of us for a week til we found a connection how to get out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197"><span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> is on the <span class="env feature">seashore</span> and we went up to <span class="populated place">Snekkersten</span>, same place and where most of them went from. </sentence><sentence id="198">Everybody went to <span class="country">Sweden</span> from there because it's the narrowest point between <span class="country">Denmark</span> and <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">It's like three, four miles wide. </sentence><sentence id="200">That's the whole thing...the <span class="env feature">waterway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">But it is very heavy <span class="dlf">stream</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="202">It's a very heavy...uh... <span class="env feature">waterway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">So we stayed in his <span class="building">house</span> and.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: In whose.... Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="235">How...first of all, how did you get to <span class="populated place">Snekkersten</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Tapped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Tapped! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: This is your <span class="building">grocer</span> calling? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="257">So he called up. </sentence><sentence id="258">He said, "I have six tons of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="259">Could you come and pick them up?" " </sentence><sentence id="260">Til he finally got a connection. </sentence><sentence id="261">And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="262">And then we got a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span>; and the <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> took us up to that place up in <span class="populated place">Snekkersten</span>,  where everybody had been collected, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="263">All the people were there. </sentence><sentence id="264">There were two or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's <span class="building">home</span>, in a <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the <span class="spatial object">taxi</span> with...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, "What's wrong? </sentence><sentence id="266">What do you have in there?" </sentence><sentence id="267">He would say, "I have a sick person. </sentence><sentence id="268">Just close the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">I have to go to the <span class="building">hospital</span>." </sentence><sentence id="270">So we were covered up and he went up there. </sentence><sentence id="271">It's not more than 30, 40 minute ride by <span class="spatial object">taxi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">We went up there. </sentence><sentence id="273">We came to that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And...uh...we met somebody from the resistance movement who took us down to the <span class="dlf">pier</span> at night, and we came down there and we were told that the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else who paid more money for it. </sentence><sentence id="275">He paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the <span class="spatial object">fishing boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">So we had to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this way that the resistance movement had a big <span class="spatial object">schooner-like</span>; and they took two or three hundred people aboard. </sentence><sentence id="277">We went all down...down below <span class="interior space">deck</span>, and uh...we went out there by <span class="spatial object">row boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">It wasn't far out to the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and when they had all the people there, first we paid them money. </sentence><sentence id="279">We paid like 2,000 krone a person. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was the going rate. </sentence><sentence id="281">Which was a lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to <span class="country">Sweden</span> the money is worthless. </sentence><sentence id="282">You can't do anything with it. </sentence><sentence id="283">You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2, whatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="284">They will also get out. </sentence><sentence id="285">Everybody got out, whether they had money or not. </sentence><sentence id="286">They were all helped to get out. </sentence><sentence id="287">And we got aboard that <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and, uh... we got off. </sentence><sentence id="288">We sailed also...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> we had this big <span class="spatial object">Swedish torpedo boat</span> or <span class="spatial object">gunboat</span> coming towards us. </sentence><sentence id="289">We all thought it was the Germans, but it was the <span class="spatial object">Swedish boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off, on the <span class="spatial object">Swedish ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">We got aboard the <span class="spatial object">Swedish ship</span> and they gave us coffee and candy or whatever, and then we went into <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And we were saved.
