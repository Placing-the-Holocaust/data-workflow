<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your <span class="building">home</span> life in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born to a physician and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="12">We had a very assimilated <span class="building">home</span> life. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was the youngest of four children. </sentence><sentence id="14">I went to <span class="building">high school</span>, as far as I could get in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end. </sentence><sentence id="16">And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult <span class="country">Germany</span>, and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for <span class="country">Germany</span>, all around. </sentence><sentence id="18"><span class="spatial object">Vesters</span>, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. </sentence><sentence id="19">My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a <span class="building">Jewish girl's orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn't foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown. </sentence><sentence id="22">I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn <span class="country">England</span>, prepare -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

for further information about this collection English -- to prepare for eventual immigration. </sentence><sentence id="25">I went to <span class="country">England</span>, and tried to learn shorthand and typing. </sentence><sentence id="26">I never did very well. </sentence><sentence id="27">I worked in <span class="building">household</span>, but then a letter came from a colleague in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some. </sentence><sentence id="28">And I decided, against anybody's advice, to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I stayed in <span class="country">Germany</span> for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the <span class="building">German Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">It's interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. </sentence><sentence id="31">I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don't have to go into. </sentence><sentence id="32">The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience. </sentence><sentence id="33">They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of <span class="country">Germany</span>, because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. </sentence><sentence id="34">And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="35">Again, I stayed in <span class="country">England</span> for a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="36">I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="37">By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to <span class="country">England</span>, and so it was a bit of a family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="38">It's all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it. </sentence><sentence id="39">And my brother from <span class="country">America</span>, where I als -- also had a brother, came. </sentence><sentence id="40">He was a lawyer here, working for the office of <span class="building">Price Administration</span>, he must have been the levelator. </sentence><sentence id="41">Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">And it was a little funny story when I arrived here. </sentence><sentence id="43">People who thought I'd gone into the <span class="env feature">wilderness</span> in <span class="country">America</span>, my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, <span class="spatial object">tea kettles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the <span class="spatial object">tea kettles</span>, and the customs official looked at me and said, "Golly, what do you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="45">Trade with the Indians?" </sentence><sentence id="46">That's the beginning of <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Cause <span class="populated place">New York</span> is overwhelming if you come from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all. </sentence><sentence id="166">I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were very nice to me, but I didn't want to play the role of a poor relative, that's just not in me. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I had a Quaker friend in <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, who was a teacher of music. </sentence><sentence id="169">And we had been through a lot in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> together, we had gone to <span class="building">school</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I phoned her, and said, "Etta, please get me a job, any job." </sentence><sentence id="171">And she came through. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I lived in the <span class="building">house</span> of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And I did a little a-around the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">I'm really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people. </sentence><sentence id="175">I took a little bit care of children. </sentence><sentence id="176">And money I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="177">Furs I had, but no money. </sentence><sentence id="178">And the man of the <span class="building">house</span>, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I have a usable brain. </sentence><sentence id="179">And he thought to get anywhere in this <span class="country">country</span>, I would have to study, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="180">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="181"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection get at least a Bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="182">And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good <span class="building">American college</span> in <span class="populated place">Swarthmore</span>, which has helped me for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="183">And they again were very nice, because they believed me. </sentence><sentence id="184">I had my examination for the <span class="building">university</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>, which I didn't have, but I said I had lost it. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through <span class="populated place">Swarthmore</span> in two years. </sentence><sentence id="186">That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, rented an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with borrowed money, and sublet <span class="interior space">rooms</span> to other students. </sentence><sentence id="187">And that way, I got through <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I'm really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major. </sentence><sentence id="189">And later on, I took psychology. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: So when you were in <span class="building">school</span>, you were also focused to some extent on social work again? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: And what did you continue to hear about developments in <span class="country">Germany</span> and Europe during this part of your schooling, and your early years in the <span class="country">U.S.</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me. </sentence><sentence id="244">I knew what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">I was dead sure, if I'd ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild. </sentence><sentence id="246">I felt guilty. </sentence><sentence id="247">I was safe, and my friends were not. </sentence><sentence id="248">I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into <span class="country">Germany</span>, even could -- and get into the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">And they, at that time, were starting their so-called <span class="interior space">refugee section</span>, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. </sentence><sentence id="250">And so I knew particularly about <span class="country">Germany</span>, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to <span class="populated place">camps</span>, but if I'm very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings. </sentence><sentence id="251">Yes, it's all going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and you also -- at least I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, "Why didn't these people get out?" </sentence><sentence id="252">Later on, I [indecipherable] they couldn't, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking. </sentence><sentence id="253">It came back more and more when I -- at the <span class="region">refugee section</span>, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from <span class="country">Germany</span>, people pleading for so-called affidavits. </sentence><sentence id="254">And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to <span class="populated place">lowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. </sentence><sentence id="256">I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="257">So we had a great time not -- of learning each other. </sentence><sentence id="258">They showed me their <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk with thee and thou, as the Quakers does. </sentence><sentence id="259">And whatever they showed me, I'd never seen before. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="260"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="261">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="262"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="263"> And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, "Did thee ever see a cow?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: So when were you in <span class="populated place">Iowa</span>, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: The latter I can answer first one. </sentence><sentence id="266">Probably in deg38 - "39. </sentence><sentence id="267">It's vague, but I think so, because deg39, I went to <span class="building">college</span>, so it must have been before 39. </sentence><sentence id="268">What was your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1101">Bad food is in all <span class="building">institutions</span>, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don't have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And I have had so many debates about food, you can't imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1103">In the three <span class="building">centers</span> I worked in. </sentence><sentence id="1104">So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the

</sentence><sentence id="1113">Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present. </sentence><sentence id="1114">You don't have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the

when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. </sentence><sentence id="1131">As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn't do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the <span class="populated

one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. </sentence><sentence id="1133">She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in <span class="country">Poland</span>, but he

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2942">A: In comparison, the more sheltered time in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> is, in their memories, more positive than it was when they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="2943">There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2944">Now that the struggle in the <span class="region">outside world</span> has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> is seen in rosier and rosier light. </sentence><sentence id="2945">I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to, and he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history. </sentence><sentence id="2946">And I suggested them. </sentence><sentence id="2947">And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they were only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures. </sentence><sentence id="2948">That, of course, is rather interesting, and my only explanation is that life on the outside was strenuous, and makes the <span class="populated place">camp</span> experience, sheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2958">A: I think for me it was a natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="2959">I have never had any doubt about going into it, and I must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of service, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that's part of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2962">Q: I believe that recently you donated a few items to the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2963">Could you briefly tell me about those items? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2966">A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul Wallenberg, in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2967">It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original, and I sent it to the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2968">I also sent them a picture of the <span class="building">sanitorium</span> in <span class="populated place">Merrano</span>, and one has This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2969">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2970"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 the director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse's aides. </sentence><sentence id="2971">I also sent them most recently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to interrogate Goering in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2972">That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better place with the <span class="building">museum</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
