How shall I say it? </sentence><sentence id="44">A very comfortable, not luxurious life...I can't say that...but we had a very lovely <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence

id="48">And we went back to the same place where I was born because I was born in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">And so was my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="50">My little brother, John...my younger, brother George was born already in a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">But I was terribly upset. </sentence><sentence id="52">So upset that I didn't even take my mother in...with her we had a little <span class="spatial object">rental car</span> that time. </sentence><sentence id="53">We went specifically on my mother's request to go back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">She wanted to see the old <span class="country">country</span> once more, so we went in <span class="populated place">77</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">And we went to that <span class="building">house</span>, and it was unfriendly, dark and not clean so we didn't go inside at all. </sentence><sentence id="56">When...when I went inside is when I went with my husband, Norman. </sentence><sentence id="57">In 1986 I think or 85 we went to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">I wanted to show him. </sentence><sentence id="59">We came from <span class="country">Israel</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="60">He has a brother in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">So we went and I said to my husband, "I'd really like to go back to the  <span class="building">house</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="62">To the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">It was an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">It was not a <span class="building">private home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">And it's lovely <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">It's a very well known <span class="dlf">street</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">It's called . </sentence><sentence id="68">And nowadays when we went there with my husband, there are some <span class="building">embassy</span> or delegations in that <span class="region">area</span>, in that <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">So we lived in that <span class="dlf">street</span> and ____ was another <span class="dlf">street</span>, corner. </sentence><sentence id="70">And so when I went there it seemed the same in a way again, but I opened the main <span class="dlf">door</span> and inside it was filthy, and the main <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was either walled in or changed so I couldn't go into the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">It was so disappointing for me and I was so sad that I told my husband, "Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="72">It's no use to look for something." </sentence><sentence id="73">But in my time, it was a very beautiful <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">It had four <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span> and I think had two <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span> and had a little maid...for the maid. </sentence><sentence id="75">We had a permanent woman who lived with us for many, many years and then later on changed to other one who also lived with us for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="76">And...uh...we had...and I described this...not in this paper what I left but I made a tape on this actually at <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span> and I lived there really remember. </sentence><sentence id="77">I remember the curtains were all with strawberry velvet and in the summertime my mother took it off and changed it for a summer curtains that the sun shouldn't eat it up. </sentence><sentence id="78">And we had a little <span class="interior space">music room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">One of the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> was kind of a <span class="interior space">music room</span> because my mother played the <span class="spatial object">piano</span> beautifully and my father played the harp, which is very unusual that the man plays the harp, but he played the harp. </sentence><sentence id="80">Everybody else in the family, including me, not anymore, including me, we ...we sang. </sentence><sentence id="81">We loved to sing. </sentence><sentence id="82">My mother had a very pretty voice. </sentence><sentence id="83">My father had a lovely baritone, so we used to play in that <span class="interior space">music room</span> and friends of my father came and they sang so we had very lovely memories on the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="84">Hanukkah or Yom Kippur or Pasah, and even Christmas I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="85">We had a wonderful event even on Christmas time. </sentence><sentence id="86">You know, <span class="country">Hungary</span> was a very Catholic country. </sentence><sentence id="87">Everybody had <span class="env feature">Christmas trees</span> and all this, so everybody was even holiday feeling in that time, winter. </sentence><sentence id="88">And we had...I remember my...the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>... my mother's and father's <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> was...was in that time, probably was personal when they got married, was light pink and had all lace and so, the children...my brother and myself, we were in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, never separated. </sentence><sentence id="89">I don't remember when we were separated. </sentence><sentence id="90">And then later my...my brother, my little brother was born and...uh...he...1 don't know whether he was in a separate <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="92">But it was a lovely <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">We had...in the <span class="building">house</span> was...all the heating were with <span class="spatial object">fire ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">I don't know what they <span class="spatial object">stoves</span> or <span class="spatial object">ovens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">I don't know how they call it. </sentence><sentence id="96">Beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="97">Each <span class="interior space">room</span> had a different color. </sentence><sentence id="98">One was brown. </sentence><sentence id="99">The other one was pink. </sentence><sentence id="100">So we liked to sit around there. </sentence><sentence id="101">And so the regular life was very peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="102">My father worked, and we went to...later on <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">I remember only the years from my own life when I went to <span class="building">primary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same <span class="building">primary school</span> a year before I did, and my brother, George, much later...it was already almost war time, he went to that same <span class="building">primary school</span> which was called <span class="building">Princess Julienne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">It was a <span class="building">Dutch Reform private school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">The <span class="building">Dutch Reform Church private school</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and it still it exists because I took my husband and showed him and said, "Look, how small it looks and..." It was beautiful in my time because it was well kept. </sentence><sentence id="107">Now it wasn't anymore...the <span class="env feature">ground</span> well kept. </sentence><sentence id="108">So I went there to see so after I attended that <span class="building">school</span> and my brother, my late brother, after 4 years...we had 4 years <span class="building">primary school</span>, he went to a so-called <span class="building">gymnasium</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were not called <span class="building">high schools</span>. _ </sentence><sentence id="110">or <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="111">He went to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span> which was very near where we lived. _, </sentence><sentence id="112">it's called. </sentence><sentence id="113">This is an old famous Hungarian patriot's name, and he went there and he got his Bachelors Degree there after 8  years. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I went from that...from the <span class="building">primary school</span>, I went to the <span class="building">Jewish leitsiam</span>, which is...the <span class="dlf">street</span> still exists. </sentence><sentence id="115">I don't think that the <span class="building">school</span> existed in <span class="dlf">Albiana Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">Maybe it is. </sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't look for that one. </sentence><sentence id="118">What I was looking for and surprisingly I didn't find when I went back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>...I went for...after 4 years in that <span class="building">school</span>, I went for a year or so...a year to a <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">And then from...from the <span class="building">Jewish school</span>...the <span class="building">Catholic school</span>, and on the end I ended in the Commercial Academy of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, which is a very beautiful and very important <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">And I went there for 2 years. </sentence><sentence id="121">Actually, I have at <span class="building">home</span>...in back in <span class="region">Arizona</span>, my <span class="building">primary school</span> report cards of 4 years and I found some of the report cards from the <span class="building">Jewish leitsiam</span>, <span class="building">high school</span>, so-called <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">I didn't find anything from the <span class="building">commercial academy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">But as a...as a history, I learned that the <span class="building">Commercial Academy</span> but as a...as a history I learned at the <span class="building">Commercial Academy</span> to write <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span> and geography and mathematics and subjects, accounting and things which was connected to the..uh...Commercial <span class="building">Academy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And I didn't find the <span class="building">Academy</span> at all, and I told my husband that I really have to go back and look for that. </sentence><sentence id="125">Why don't I? </sentence><sentence id="126">So I attended that. </sentence><sentence id="127">So the school years, if I can say that to you...the <span class="building">primary school</span> and the <span class="building">high school</span> were beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="128">The primary years, of course, were the best. </sentence><sentence id="129">I remember all the little gifts we have gotten. </sentence><sentence id="130">I was a very good student in <span class="building">primary school</span> and my late brother, we were always being Jewish students in a...in a Protestant, because Dutch Reform was...mostly, they were Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="131">It's a <span class="building">reform school</span>, and even we...the Jewish children, we had special religion class everyday in the morning, the Jewish students...the few of them. </sentence><sentence id="132">And we were allowed to go to their <span class="building">church</span> where they sing all the beautiful psalms, you know, the Protestant Psalms. </sentence><sentence id="133">And we learned that. </sentence><sentence id="134">And that gave us a very good relationship with the other students. </sentence><sentence id="135">Unfortunately, I have never ever met anybody when I went back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> in 77, anybody at all from my <span class="building">school</span> years. </sentence><sentence id="136">Probably was a Gentile Christian children went other ways. </sentence><sentence id="137">The Jewish probably were all most killed, because I didn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="138">So in our life, I speak about, you know, 23, and I got to <span class="building">school</span> when I was 5 and a half, 20 years, 29, 30, 32, and all the way up to...I would say... remember the date on 1938, that my father was at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> sitting at lunch time. </sentence><sentence id="139">He came <span class="building">home</span> every day for lunch, and he came every evening <span class="building">home</span> and...and the good years he had even a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I know it was a <span class="spatial object">Fiat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we...we didn't travel on that much I know, but when we went to <span class="env feature">Lake Balaton</span> for the summer season for the 4 weeks, we traveled on this <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">So...but that doesn't mean that we were wealthy, just because he was in this position in this <span class="building">textile company</span> which was the largest in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, he could afford it I suppose or they gave it to him. </sentence><sentence id="143">I don't know whether it was his or the company, but we had the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">And...uh...I just don't know...that day I remember very clearly...1 remember that for years, that my father opened the newspaper at lunchtime. </sentence><sentence id="145">We were very quiet at lunch. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were not supposed to...not because he was strict. </sentence><sentence id="147">He was not as strict...my mother was stricter to us than my father. </sentence><sentence id="148">I never even been spanked or anything my father ever in my life. </sentence><sentence id="149">Never! </sentence><sentence id="150">I didn't put this in the paper, but I come to my mind, the only time I remember that my father was...became angry with me. </sentence><sentence id="151">One day when I was a child and he said, "You have to go with me today and with , to Grandma," his mother who passed away before the war _____. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I don't know...I didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="153">I said, "No, Father or No, Daddy. </sentence><sentence id="154">I don't go. </sentence><sentence id="155">I don't want to go to the..."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: You were saying that your father came <span class="building">home</span> one day and. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: And my father came <span class="building">home</span> one day and I remember that he opened the newspaper and he says, "My God, the Germans occupied <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>." </sentence><sentence id="336">And that was in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="337">So, 1938...I was born in 23, so I remember that...at the paper he said that. </sentence><sentence id="338">And that...that from that day on, really times in a way changed. </sentence><sentence id="339">Not much, but in a way, because first of all we lived still in that...in that <span class="building">building</span> where I was born, but I don't know if in 1940 or 41, his salary decreased and something happened in the company. </sentence><sentence id="340">He didn't have the <span class="spatial object">car</span> needless to say...anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="341">And in 1941, in <span class="country">Hungary</span>...I remember that very clearly because I was not such a young little girl. </sentence><sentence id="342">I remember in 1941, they began to take away...the Hungarians, the Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="343">Certain young men, certain age. </sentence><sentence id="344">They had to go to <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">1941 or 1942 they began to concentrate these people in <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">Young men and so I remember that...that time already, we had to move out from the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">We moved in another place called which is forget me <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I been back on that <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">We seen the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with my younger brother and with my mother, and that part is very nice, still very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="350">Not too far from our original <span class="building">home</span>, but not that near, maybe a mile and a half or so, walking distance. </sentence><sentence id="351">And we went there because I suppose my father couldn't afford the big <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">We didn't have a maid then there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="353">Our maid who we loved very much went back to her <span class="populated place">village</span> on that time. </sentence><sentence id="354">I remember that well. </sentence><sentence id="355">And so we moved to this <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which is much smaller. </sentence><sentence id="356">Was very pretty too because I remember that my mother could put her famous curtains and the lace covers. </sentence><sentence id="357">No <span class="spatial object">piano</span> in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">I don't know whether they just sold it probably. </sentence><sentence id="359">No <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, but her own <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">She had very beautiful...the <span class="interior space">living room</span> <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> was ___ wood. </sentence><sentence id="361">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="362">That was with us. </sentence><sentence id="363">So we had a nice <span class="building">home</span> there too. </sentence><sentence id="364">And from that <span class="building">home</span>, we were then later on taken to the <span class="building">David Star house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">I remember that we had to leave that. </sentence><sentence id="366">But the...the <span class="populated place">town</span> changed because they were frightening times. </sentence><sentence id="367"><span class="country">Hungary</span> I think entered already in the war as part of the (clearing throat) Nazi Germany.1942 I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="368">I am confused with the dates, which you said is not so important for me. </sentence><sentence id="369">But I know that in 1942 men were taken away to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">In 1943, that I know positively...1943 my brother was taken also. </sentence><sentence id="371">It was taken...in that particular time the Hungarian government issued some decrees that certain age, young Jewish men has to go in  that...in that <span class="populated place">district</span> and whichever <span class="populated place">district</span> we lived, and so my brother had to go and left in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="372">I seen him once more because in the...in the <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>...so-called <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>, because and that's the exact translation, ____ is labor and <span class="populated place">tava</span> is a <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so it was a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, where they did...I don't know what work. </sentence><sentence id="373">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="374">Probably... I don't know what they did. </sentence><sentence id="375">Anyhow, we weren't supposed to visit him, but we had cards for him, post cards which I have along with me. </sentence><sentence id="376">And...uh...my brother...uh... we were...we could visit my brother once. </sentence><sentence id="377">They advised us we come down to <span class="populated place">Mohacs</span> is the <span class="populated place">city</span> where we went. </sentence><sentence id="378">It's <span class="region">south</span> from <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">And we went on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="380">My father didn't come along. </sentence><sentence id="381">I don't know what reason. </sentence><sentence id="382">That was in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="383">And we visited my brother on...we went on...by <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, on the <span class="spatial

were very rude and they were very bad and they pushed us and so we were very frightened and they hustled some people in a little <span class="interior space">room</span> there and I...we didn't go to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">And just where we had to wait for my brother, and my brother came and we seen my brother. </sentence><sentence id="391">He

</sentence><sentence id="396">So I don't know why it didn't come ever to my father's mind to leave and as a matter of fact, it didn't because we were brought up...my...my brother, my late brother, and

</sentence><sentence id="400">That's not true. </sentence><sentence id="401">We were educated to love everybody. </sentence><sentence id="402">Just keep our religion as much as we can and respect our

us...to the Jewish people that everybody should leave the <span class="building">house</span>, and they had to be in an assigned <span class="building">building</span>, and that's how we went from

class="building">building</span> and I told him the address...93 or 95. </sentence><sentence id="1744">I think it was 95. </sentence><sentence id="1745">On the <span class="interior space">second

</sentence><sentence id="1747">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="1748">He did bring it to the protected <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Not immediately, but after a few days where we had the two or three <span class="spatial object">pillows</span> in there, so we had some warm...warmer clothing and some pots and pans. </sentence><sentence id="1750">But at that time, if] remember correctly, in the <span class="building">building</span> there were no gas, no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="1751">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1752">So the people there had to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1753">And my mother had two big bags of flour...I remember that...in the <span class="spatial object">basket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Like this. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And she didn't...we couldn't eat anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1756">My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well

they brought that in and we made fire on it. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And my mother, in one of the <span class="spatial object">pots</span> of snow water, made...we called it, very funny now when that it comes to mind, we called it ___ because it was flat like a pancake, but it was just flour and water. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And it was delicious. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1765">People stuck together if they could. </sentence><sentence id="1766">They were bombing in the <span class="building">house</span>...outside in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and afraid who comes to pick us up because there were a million rumors. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Because, you know, you heard all the time, the shootings and the bombings and the time to the <span class="building">Spanish protected house</span>, in the <span class="region">Margaret Island</span>, we knew from rumors that there are still German soldiers and Hungarian autocrats people they tried to...to beat, to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1768">And not only that, during that period...that time that we were in the protected <span

we were on the last <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and I asked Mr. Perlasca today, "Was it five floors or was it nine floors?" </sentence><sentence id="1770">And he said, "I think it was five <span class="interior space">floors</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1771">And I think it was nine <span class="interior space">floors</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1772">We were on the top on this protected <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1773">On...during that period of time, there was an explosion and the <span class="dlf">Margaret Island bridge</span> exploded totally. </sentence><sentence id="1774">All the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, by the way, the Hungarians probably did, but we seen it through the <span class="dlf">window</span> and the

my hair was full of glass. </sentence><sentence id="1778">And all little bloods running which I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1779">But they says, "What happened to your face?" </sentence><sentence id="1780">The little glass went into my hair and cut me. </sentence><sentence id="1781">I put this down that there was a professor on the <span class="building">building</span>, a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: It happened the following. </sentence><sentence id="1874">On early morning, the shouting was in the <span class="building">building</span>...I was actually <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> at that time with my mother and my brother, <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> in one of the <span class="interior

was colder than others. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And everybody from the <span class="building">building</span>, from <span class="interior space">top floor</span>, they all have to come. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Because some people they even slept on the <span class="dlf">stairways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1880">They were...I don't know where they were. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Everybody has to line up. </sentence><sentence id="1882">When we lined up, we just didn't know exactly what will happen, only what we heard. </sentence><sentence id="1883">That these people will be marching us directly into the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> and will kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1884">That much I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1885">I didn't tell this to my mother and little brother but I said, "This is the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="1886">If these people will take us out and the Spanish are not around to save us, we are dead." </sentence><sentence id="1887">And it happened to other people I know after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1888">To us it didn't happen because... don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1889">That's what I have to find out from Mr. Perlasca. </sentence><sentence id="1890">How is it possible that on that morning, suddenly the Spanish Legation representative, one of them was Havier ___ with a document in his hand and maybe Mr. Perlasca, because there were others...they were debating and shouting and discussing with the Hungarian Nazis <span class="interior

class="interior space">downstairs</span>, because we were <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, and other people all lined up...on the <span class="interior space">stairway</span> lined up, because there were at least 200 in my opinion in that <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And they were shouting and discussing and in the meantime, we heard shootings. </sentence><sentence id="1893">It was already the end of the war for <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1894">The Russians were all around. </sentence><sentence id="1895">And one minute to the other, it took us minute, my brother...my brother, George, had a little knapsack because that was in this...in this <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="1897">There were others...lot of people in the same situation as we were. </sentence><sentence id="1898">We freight...what...how can we get away from this?And the Spanish people from the <span class="building">Legation</span> whether it was Havier or Mr. Perlasca, Giorgia Perlasca, whoever it was, they won over these Hungarian Nazis, and they tell, "You cannot touch these people because this is the Spanish government protection. </sentence><sentence id="1899">The Spanish government was befriended with the Hungarian government. </sentence><sentence id="1900">They got none because the Spanish Franco was a fascist, and the <span class="building">Spanish Legation</span> was there until the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="1901">And that morning because it was still dark, Havier came to me and to my mother and to my  2 brother and to others...I'm sure he said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="1902">I only observe what he done to us, and he said, "We are seeing you last time. </sentence><sentence id="1903">The <span class="building">Legation</span> must leave <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> because we are surrounded with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The Russian come in and close in the <span class="populated place">city</span> any minute." </sentence><sentence id="1905">And I said, "Where do you go, <span

</sentence><sentence id="1908">And I said, "How do you go?" </sentence><sentence id="1909">I said, "By <span class="spatial object">train</span> and by <span class="spatial object">car</span>, we all...we will leave the <span class="building">Legation</span>, whatever the Ambassador...everybody has to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1910">We close the <span class="building">Legation</span>, what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And he said, "you want to come along?" </sentence><sentence id="1912">And I said, "I will never go without my mother and brother, which is true, and we embraced and everybody embraced. </sentence><sentence id="1913">It was a terrible moment. </sentence><sentence id="1914">It's terrible even me for now. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And he left and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1962">A: They convinced that we should stay. </sentence><sentence id="1963">They convinced them that this <span class="building">building</span> is under the Swiss...<span class="building">Spanish Legation</span>, Spanish government protection, and they cannot touch us because they are Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="1964">They are diplomat, and they cannot go. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And when I read the article is absolutely that's how it...how it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1970">Q: Was that the last problem that you encountered? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1972">A: That was what is interesting what you asking me because, curiously enough, after that period of time that the Hungarians cleared the way, these Nazis and the Spanish, everybody cleared it away, the misery was there in the <span class="building">house</span> because we didn't know that nobody else will bother us, but I don't recall in my mind, thinking about this million times, that anybody from the Hungarian Nazis, or the Germans or anybody or no Spaniards, nobody came to that <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1973">We were on our own. </sentence><sentence id="1974">I only know that there was a heavy shooting, bombing, all this December what I heard...if this was the beginning of December because I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1975">I don't recall that until the that anybody was bugging the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I don't remember that any Hungarian came. </sentence><sentence id="1977">At least, we were <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> really with my mother and brother and, you know, we were hundred...I don't know how many people were in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, probably 40. </sentence><sentence id="1978">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2038">A: That was a...that was a...that was also very emotional moment, I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2039">Because when nothing happened, when it was fairly quiet to...to say fairly quiet that nobody came to take us out or shoot us, but we heard the shooting and people in the <span class="building">building</span>, you know, men. </sentence><sentence id="2040">They were men. </sentence><sentence id="2041">They were all talking. </sentence><sentence id="2042">Everybody was rumoring, "Where are the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2043">The Russians are near." </sentence><sentence id="2044">Because we heard...I knew from _Havier. </sentence><sentence id="2045">Havier told me. </sentence><sentence id="2046">Remember he said that the Russians are all around the <span class="populated place">city</span>, you know, and it was such a shooting, you know, everywhere that we knew that they come any day. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Every day we said now, today, tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2048">But December the 25th was the worst night of my life of the bombing because we were <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> was sounding like a <span class="spatial object">drum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2049">Boom, boom, boom. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And I was so upset and we were so hungry and we were so miserable that I told myself and God should forgive me, I said, "Just a bomb should drop on us. </sentence><sentence id="2051">It should be a end." </sentence><sentence id="2052">It didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2053">So it came other days and other terrible days and hunger and hunger and people were helping each other what they can. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Some people they just slept. </sentence><sentence id="2055">They didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2056">And on the 18th of January, I know that we went out from the <span class="building">house</span> where we lived and the professor who cleaned my face with his hands because we didn't have anything, suddenly I heard him saying and I seen him as now...he says, " " And the Russian soldiers appeared in the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2057">And not one, not two. </sentence><sentence id="2058">Many!
