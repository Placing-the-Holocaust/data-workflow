<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Tell me your full name and tell me when and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My full name is Blanka Erma Rothschild. </sentence><sentence id="6">Born Fischer. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in <span class="country">Poland</span> in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, which is a large <span class="populated place">city</span> considered <span class="populated place">Polish manufacturing city</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me when you were born, and then tell me a little bit about what your childhood was like before the war came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in August of 1922. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="15">My family was very close, well educated. </sentence><sentence id="16">I had a very happy childhood. </sentence><sentence id="17">I attended a <span class="building">private school</span>, and I had a lady at <span class="building">home</span> who took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="18">I had several cousins because my dad had several brothers and three sisters, and my mother had two brothers and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="19">And each one of them had one or two children. </sentence><sentence id="20">So we were a very close family, very devoted. </sentence><sentence id="21">Something that I treasure. </sentence><sentence id="22">My childhood gave me a very good background, strength, and love. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: What did your parents do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: My father was -- he actually had two faculties. </sentence><sentence id="36">He was an architect and an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="37">He studied outside of <span class="country">Poland</span> because <span class="country">Poland</span> had very strict admission for Jews in their <span class="building">universities</span>, so my grandparents sent him to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and then to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">And he was mainly an engineer in his last years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: So around about -- well, tell me what you remember of the middle 1930s. </sentence><sentence id="44">Do you remember changes happening and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="48">Well, in the middle 1930s, I -- in the beginning of the 30s, I attended the <span class="building">German gymnasium</span>, which was the best in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">But with the change in the political situation, my parents switched me to a <span class="building">Polish gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">And, unfortunately, I was sort of isolated. </sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't feel any pressure, any political pressure. </sentence><sentence id="52">Anything that was coming, I was unaware of it. </sentence><sentence id="53">We had a group of friends. </sentence><sentence id="54">In the summer, we were going away, and we had a small place in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">And it was quite a satisfactory life. </sentence><sentence id="56">However, in 1938 and "39, the changes started to occur. </sentence><sentence id="57">We read about the rise of Nazis in <span class="country">Germany</span>, which was neighboring <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">We were aware of the speeches; however, we still felt pretty safe and secure. </sentence><sentence id="59">My uncle, who was a physician, had many patients </sentence></p><p><sentence id="60"> 01:04 who were of German origin, so-called Volksdeutsche then living in our <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">And when he visited them, because at that time, a doctor visited patients in their <span class="building">home</span>, they were wearing signs. </sentence><sentence id="62">They were wearing swastikas in the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">There were pictures of Adolph Hitler. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="64">And we still didn't take this too seriously. </sentence><sentence id="65">Seriously enough of thinking of leaving. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: And then tell me what happened when the war started and how you remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I remember distinctly September "39. </sentence><sentence id="68">The Ist of September was the first day of war, and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory. </sentence><sentence id="69">They're etched so deeply, and I remember exactly the moment. </sentence><sentence id="70">I was sitting on a <span class="interior space">balcony</span>, reading a book. </sentence><sentence id="71">And all of sudden, I heard a thud, a tremendous thud sound, and I saw <span class="spatial object">planes</span> circling above the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this, that this was the day that the war started, and the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> came over <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">I did not know that they crossed the <span class="dlf">border</span> at that moment, but I remember the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> and the thud. </sentence><sentence id="74">And it startled me, and I got up and went to the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">This is something that is etched in my memory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Did your parents talk? </sentence><sentence id="86">Did you hear your parents talking? </sentence><sentence id="87">Did they know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="88">Were they afraid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: My father died a year before the war. </sentence><sentence id="94">Two years before the war, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="95">Two years before the war. </sentence><sentence id="96">He suffered from uremia, and at that time, there was no cure for it then. </sentence><sentence id="97">There were no dialysis known to medicine. </sentence><sentence id="98">And I was with my mother, and my mother was being courted at the time by a friend, a physician. </sentence><sentence id="99">So they were rather happy. </sentence><sentence id="100">The clouds of the war were sort of coming, but yet we did not realize to the fullest the seriousness of the situation of -- in <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="building">lyceum</span>, which was equal to <span class="building">junior college</span> here, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="101">And the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> started to play national Polish hymns and the patriotic speeches, and we were listening to people telling us that we were invincible, which was very laughable because <span class="country">Poland</span> did not have the technology that <span class="country">Germany</span> possessed. </sentence><sentence id="102">In a few days, the Germans went in our <span class="populated place">city</span>, which was not that far from the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">And while Germans were coming with their <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, the Poles were fighting on their beautiful horses with lances, dressed beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="104">Being patriotic and brought up in the spirit, everything was beautiful to me, but the reality of what was happening was ugly. </sentence><sentence id="105">Very soon after that, the Germans started to issue laws. </sentence><sentence id="106">Curfew was one of the first. </sentence><sentence id="107">We were not permitted on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> past, I believe, 5 o'clock, I'm not too sure about that hour. </sentence><sentence id="108">We were required to wear yellow stars with the sign Jude identifying us as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="109">The money was frozen in the <span class="building">bank</span>, and we started to be very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="110">One particular time, I was walking on a <span class="dlf">street</span> not too far from my <span class="building">home</span>, and I was called by a German officer. </sentence><sentence id="111">He called me, motioning with his hand to come over. </sentence><sentence id="112">My heart was beating wildly. </sentence><sentence id="113">I crossed the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">He asked me to go <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> to his <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and being a young girl, I was just petrified. </sentence><sentence id="115">He asked me to clean the place. </sentence><sentence id="116">He took his gun off, put it on a <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and was sitting on a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> next to it watching me. </sentence><sentence id="117">Well, I didn't know too much about cleaning, but I cleaned very fast, and I did what he asked me to do. </sentence><sentence id="118">And he looked at me, and he said in German "It is a shame that you are a Jew," and he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="119">This is another of the moments that I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="120">After that, I wasn't going out too much. </sentence><sentence id="121">My mother and my grandmother tried to shield me. </sentence><sentence id="122">Since the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that we were  living in belonged to -- this was a large <span class="building">building</span> which belonged to us, we knew many German people in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, Polish people of German origin. </sentence><sentence id="123">And my grandmother, who is very wise, asked one of them to come and be sort of a supervisor of the <span class="building">building</span>, so she made an <span class="interior space">office</span> in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and we did not have to display anything on the <span class="dlf">door</span> identifying us as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="125">So for a little while, we were spared. </sentence><sentence id="126">However, pretty soon the Germans caught on. </sentence><sentence id="127">One day -- this is another of these moments -- one day there was a <span class="spatial object">ring</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">An officer with an aide came to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">The officer had a scar on his face identifying him as a student who had dueled probably in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span>, Germany University. </sentence><sentence id="130">He also had a black skull on his head, a skull which identified him, I think, as a member of SS, and we knew what that was, Gestapo SS. </sentence><sentence id="131">He walked into the place. </sentence><sentence id="132">My grandmother, who was very fluent in German and knew that he represented danger, asked him if she could contribute to the <span class="building">German Red Cross</span>, money. </sentence><sentence id="133">She thought that she would mollify him and that he will leave. </sentence><sentence id="134">At which point, he hit her. </sentence><sentence id="135">He had suede gloves, and he hit her with a gloved hand across the face. </sentence><sentence id="136">He proceeded from <span class="interior space">room</span> to <span class="interior space">room</span> with a man and was pointing to things which struck his fancy, and the young man started to pack them. </sentence><sentence id="137">At the end of one of our <span class="interior space">rooms</span> was a small <span class="interior space">alcove</span> filled with fern greens, and there was a <span class="spatial object">cage</span> with a <span class="spatial object">canary</span> hanging there. </sentence><sentence id="138">Once he saw the <span class="spatial object">canary</span>, his whole appearance changed. </sentence><sentence id="139">He became enchanted with the bird, and he asked us "Is this a male or a female canary? </sentence><sentence id="140">How lovely does he sing." </sentence><sentence id="141">He was a changed man. </sentence><sentence id="142">At that moment, I realized that a <span class="building">canary</span> was more important, had more meaning to him than all of us human beings. </sentence><sentence id="143">This is one of the moments that I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="144">The man was an educated man; I knew that. </sentence><sentence id="145">And we were nothing, but the <span class="spatial object">canary</span> represented something wonderful to him. </sentence><sentence id="146">He was mesmerized by the <span class="spatial object">canary</span>, and he beat my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="147">Well we were staying in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for some time until the Germans started to throw people out to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> -- I need to explain the term of "<span class="populated place">ghetto</span>" to many people and children who are listening to me. </sentence><sentence id="148">A <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is an isolated part of our <span class="populated place">city</span> situated in what used to be a very poor <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and consisted of several <span class="dlf">blocks</span> of <span class="building">buildings</span> and small <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And we knew that we are going to be thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="150">And since we knew somebody that was an engineer who was well acquainted with my family who lived at the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and he asked us, since he was being evacuated, if we could live in his little <span class="building">house</span> and take care of it, which we agreed to greedily because it was clean. </sentence><sentence id="151">It had three <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and had a <span class="dlf">garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">And a <span class="interior space">garden</span> was very important because there was some food growing there and we moved there. </sentence><sentence id="153">After a while, they started to send Czechish refugees, Jews from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and they were being assigned <span class="interior space">spaces</span> in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was small; there was not much <span class="interior space">space</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">Well, we received a couple, a husband and wife -- a charming, lovely couple whose children were being kept by some Czechish neighbors, Christian people who helped to save the children. </sentence><sentence id="156">And the couple stayed with us for a while. </sentence><sentence id="157">But we were being already used to the rations, and we were deteriorating at a slower rate than they. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were thrown in directly from the good life to the very, very bad, and they both died fairly soon. </sentence><sentence id="159">We were all being starved, and my grandmother had an  idea. </sentence><sentence id="160">The so-called "Aelteste der Juden", you wouldn't know which one. </sentence><sentence id="161">The man who was in charge of <span class="populated place">Lodz Ghetto</span> was named Chaim Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="162">Before the war, he was an agent for an <span class="building">orphanage</span> and collected money for the orphans. </sentence><sentence id="163">Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the <span class="building">orphanage</span>, my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help. </sentence><sentence id="164">There were so- called talons (ph), small pieces of paper for some food distribution, and I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="165">It's another moment in my memory. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a long <span class="interior space">room</span> with a long <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">He was at the end of the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and I was at the other one, at the other end. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was led in the <span class="interior space">room</span>, and I said to him in Polish " Panye President," which means Mr. President. </sentence><sentence id="169">And at that moment, he picked up a cane and wanted to hit me because he resented the fact that I didn't speak Jewish to him, which I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="170">So I quickly told him "I am from this-and-this family." </sentence><sentence id="171">And at that, he stopped and said, "Where do you live?" </sentence><sentence id="172">Then I gave him the address and I left. </sentence><sentence id="173">He sent next day somebody with few of the pieces of papers for some sugar and for me to work in a <span class="building">bakery</span> for three months. </sentence><sentence id="174">And that was a life-saving because I could eat some bread in the <span class="building">bakery</span>, and I could take some small pieces <span class="building">home</span>, and my ration card was being used by my family. </sentence><sentence id="175">This lasted three months. </sentence><sentence id="176">Three months later because they were changing -- three months later, he remembered me. </sentence><sentence id="177">He had fantastic memory. </sentence><sentence id="178">He switched me to a place which was called <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> -- some sort of <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were feeding for two weeks soup to workers who were essential to their production in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">You see, <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> had several <span class="building">establishments</span> working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="181">In order to stay alive we were obligated to produce some work. </sentence><sentence id="182">In that <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, I worked as a waitress. </sentence><sentence id="183">And one day about a week later, this Mr.Rumkowski's sister-in-law came to the <span class="interior space">room</span>, and she saw me and she said, "Cut your hair," and I didn't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="184">And said, "Out," and she threw me out of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">Well, that was a tragedy because that's where the food was. </sentence><sentence id="186">I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski, who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">People had very wrong ideas about themselves. </sentence><sentence id="188">He was instrumental in assigning me to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> where they were peeling potatoes, and I was very happy about that. </sentence><sentence id="189">I was peeling potatoes all day long, and trying to steal some of the peels to take <span class="building">home</span>, because peels meant food. </sentence><sentence id="190">All this ended soon after. </sentence><sentence id="191">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was being systematically emptied. </sentence><sentence id="192">There were <span class="spatial object">transports</span>; people were being sent away. </sentence><sentence id="193">At that time, even Rumkowski couldn't help. </sentence><sentence id="194">He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the <span class="building">orphanage</span> or whatever, and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young women to a place at the <span class="region">outskirts</span> called <span class="populated place">Marianske</span> in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">And we were there, working there in some meaningless work we performed. </sentence><sentence id="196">We were supposed to build cement blocks for the <span class="building">houses</span> that were being ruined in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">They were trying to have cement blocks to build some sort of <span class="building">shelter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">We were there for a while, and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was being systemically emptied, one <span class="spatial object">transport</span> after another. </sentence><sentence id="199">And <span class="populated place">Rumkowski</span> amongst them. </sentence><sentence id="200">The <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were going then from August 1944, and after a while the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was almost empty. </sentence><sentence id="201">My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that place  to go to a <span class="building">hospital</span>, which contained 500 people. </sentence><sentence id="202">There were two groups left in the entire <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">One was ours from <span class="populated place">Marianske</span>, and one was hidden on a <span class="dlf">street</span> called <span class="dlf">Jakuba</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">I only know about it because I had a friend who was hidden there. </sentence><sentence id="205">At that time, I was not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="206">The 500 of us were in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="building">hospital</span> had a couple of physicians with their families. </sentence><sentence id="208">There were children. </sentence><sentence id="209">We slept, my mother and I, in a very large <span class="interior space">room</span> with about 20 other people. </sentence><sentence id="210">I think we had -- I don't remember if there were <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span>, but we slept on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">We would lie down in <span class="spatial object">rows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">For a small infraction, a couple of people were being taken away and sent away. </sentence><sentence id="213">The German who was in charge of this place was called Hans Bebolt (ph), typical, extremely good-looking man. </sentence><sentence id="214">Blonde, typical Aryan appearance; he was brutal. </sentence><sentence id="215">He selected one of the girls and then he shot her. </sentence><sentence id="216">This was the story of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was one incident in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> which I forgot about. </sentence><sentence id="218">If I may, I'll go back to this. </sentence><sentence id="219">When we were still living in that <span class="building">house</span> of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry, we decided that I will try to go to <span class="populated place">city</span> to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">They were of German origin, but Polish. </sentence><sentence id="221">Their name was <span class="building">Mensel family</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">I took my star off, the Jewish star, and I smuggled myself through the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, and I walked through the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">with the fear in my heart looking at people, looking at little dogs which reminded me of my dog that I had to leave at <span class="building">home</span>, everything seemed very normal to me. </sentence><sentence id="224">But I knew that I didn't belong there. </sentence><sentence id="225">Finally, I reached the <span class="building">building</span> that we left, and I walked up a very broad <span class="dlf">staircase</span>, my heart was beating wildly because I didn't know how they will react to me. </sentence><sentence id="226">Will they let me in? </sentence><sentence id="227">Maybe they moved. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a long time, and the <span class="dlf">door</span> opened and it was opened by young Nina, who was the daughter of the family. </sentence><sentence id="229">As she looked at me, I saw the terror in her eyes. </sentence><sentence id="230">She was stricken with terror looking at me. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I was taken aback, but after a minute, she composed herself and put a finger to her lips indicating that I shouldn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="232">I found out that there were some German people invited to dinner. </sentence><sentence id="233">They were some sort of relation of Mr. Mensel, and she brought me to the <span class="interior space">room</span>, and Mr. and Mrs. Mensel saw me and hugged me and gave me dinner. </sentence><sentence id="234">I ate with them dinner. </sentence><sentence id="235">I was sitting at that <span class="spatial object">table</span> looking at the tablecloth, looking at the proper appointment on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">And J ate like a normal human being, and I started to resent the fact that I had to go back to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">I almost forgot about everybody else that I left. </sentence><sentence id="238">But, of course, the situation changed in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="239">After some small talk, the man was -- the German was in life, he was a professor. </sentence><sentence id="240">He had a great deal of knowledge, and the conversation was so welcome to me, so normal, and I was not used to it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="241">And young Nina helped me, she said to explain to them that I came for some books. </sentence><sentence id="242">And the books, of course, was food. </sentence><sentence id="243">And she and her mother prepared some food, and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming. </sentence><sentence id="244">And they gave me some parcels and said that I'll be back. </sentence><sentence id="245">The young soldier wanted to see me next week, and all my friends said that they will let him know if I'll be in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">And I took the <span class="spatial object">parcel</span>, and I started to walk towards the <span class="dlf">wires</span>, towards the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">Again, my heart was beating wildly. </sentence><sentence id="248">I was so, so very frightened because there were German patrols going on both sides of the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I had to time myself to a split second when they turned around and won't be there. </sentence><sentence id="250">And when I saw that he turned around, I ran to the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, so I spread them through the parcels, and I caught  part of my dress on it. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I saw it, so I retrieved a little piece, grabbed the parcels, and ran towards the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">The <span class="building">house</span> was not too far from the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">And when I reached my <span class="building">home</span>, the stress of the entire day gave up to tremendous, tremendous sobbing. </sentence><sentence id="254">I just couldn't believe what I did. </sentence><sentence id="255">I knew that with my family I had to move from this place after certain couple of months because the Germans were making the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> much smaller. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we moved to a <span class="building">house</span> on <span class="dlf">Zierske (ph) Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">This was a main <span class="dlf">street</span> in that part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and there was a <span class="spatial

cross the <span class="dlf">street</span>, it was cutting <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in half. </sentence><sentence id="259">They built a <span class="dlf">wooden bridge</span> over the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">When we lived, for instance, on one side of the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, and we worked on the other, we had to cross the <span

</sentence><sentence id="262">That was before I went to <span class="populated place">Marianske</span> where Rumkowski sent me to the girls and then back, I went back to the <span

the last few days to recall his name because I was looking forward to this interview. </sentence><sentence id="264">He promised to take this group to his <span class="building">place of work</span> and spare us <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">He was to take this group to his <span class="building">place of work</span> and spare us <span

empty, it was a very weird feeling and the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, open <span class="dlf">windows</span>, flowing curtains blowing with the wind. </sentence><sentence id="269">No people. </sentence><sentence id="270">Once we thought that we saw a glimmer of somebody in the <span class="dlf">window</span>, or a candle or something, and, of course, we averted our eyes not to give away to the German escorts that somebody was there. </sentence><sentence id="271">In November of 1944 came our time we had to be taken out. </sentence><sentence id="272">The entire population of our <span

because people had to stand. </sentence><sentence id="274">There was no place to sit or squat. </sentence><sentence id="275">If somebody was sick or even dying, he died on his feet standing up. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was just unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="277">Water was the worst, lack of water, the thirst was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="278">I tried very hard to suppress some of the moments because the life is beckoning, life is normal. </sentence><sentence id="279">I want to live a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="280">I want to be part of my family, which is very wonderful to me, but from time to time, these things keep on coming back and they haunt me. </sentence><sentence id="281">And I'm particularly happy that I am able to speak of it and to leave something behind me for mostly the young people, the people who never will, never heard, or heard a little bit about it, what it is about man's inhumanity to man. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="283"><span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> was mainly a <span class="populated place">women's camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">It was large, we never

examination, which was -- I cannot even say the word "embarrassing" because the people who conducted it were less than human. </sentence><sentence id="290">They were less than animal. </sentence><sentence id="291">We were many young girls who never undergone gynecological examinations, and they were looking for, God knows, diamonds or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="292">We were subjected to that. </sentence><sentence id="293">I had never seen <span class="spatial object">chairs</span> like  that before in my life. </sentence><sentence id="294">We were humiliated at every moment. </sentence><sentence id="295">Our clothes was taken away from us, and we were directed to a heap of clothes which probably was left from the group that was killed previously. </sentence><sentence id="296">I received some sort of a dress. </sentence><sentence id="297">I tried hard to remember, but I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="298">But there was some sort of a <span class="spatial object">dress</span> that was a little warmer. </sentence><sentence id="299">My mother, on the other hand, was given a long, silk dress, and it was November and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="300">I don't know what kind. </sentence><sentence id="301">The food we were given was, of course, of no nutritional value, no value whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="302">It was watery soup, one slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had no possessions. </sentence><sentence id="304">All of us stopped menstruating because we had no nutrition in our

covered under the <span class="spatial object">sleeve</span> because there is still a will to live and to survive no matter how horrible the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="307">Our family, when we were still together, promised each other that if one of us would survive, we should try -- at least one -- to shout to all the world, to all the <span class="country">nations</span>, to all the people and to bear witness to what we were going through. </sentence><sentence id="308">To what people were capable of doing. </sentence><sentence id="309">In this <span class="populated

<span class="building">Appells</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">One day I was fainting because between the hunger and malnutrition, I was just fainting. </sentence><sentence id="314">And the Germans had dogs with them, large German Shepherds, who were being trained to attack people. </sentence><sentence id="315">And they let one go as I was lying down, and the dog came to me and licked my face. </sentence><sentence id="316">That's another moment. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I came to. </sentence><sentence id="318">I adore dogs and animals, and I don't know if it's true if the dog sensed it or not, but that's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="319">The dog did not touch me, he licked my face. </sentence><sentence id="320">And my friends picked me up, and I was again standing there as a number. </sentence><sentence id="321">That was <span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322"><span class="populated place">Ravensbriick</span> had many women prisoners from different <span class="country">nations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">We did not see them because the <span class="dlf">block</span> -- there were <span

</sentence><sentence id="325">They were mixed bunch of women. </sentence><sentence id="326">The wooden <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> were about two or three tiers high, and I was with my mother on one middle one and across from us were German prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="327">The German prisoners that were across from us were prisoners from before the war. </sentence><sentence id="328">The were murderers; they were all kinds of outcasts of the society. </sentence><sentence id="329">However, they were superior to us because they had the German blood. </sentence><sentence id="330">We were only Jews. </sentence><sentence id="331">The two German women who were across from us were two women; one of them was called Peter and she was the man. </sentence><sentence id="332">I was 16, 17, 18, 19 years old, I don't remember, and this was the first time that I was exposed to something like that, and she could hit us. </sentence><sentence id="333">We had no right to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="334">She was German. </sentence><sentence id="335">In that <span class="populated place">camp</span> we were issued triangles of different colors. </sentence><sentence id="336">The black triangles, which the murderers wore, were given to the murderers and to the prisoners of crimes. </sentence><sentence id="337">The green ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses -- no. </sentence><sentence id="338">The green ones, excuse me, the green ones were given to the thieves, common thieves. </sentence><sentence id="339">The purple ones were given to Jehovah Witnesses, who were wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="340">These were Germans who did not believe in violence, and they were thrown with us and shared our <span

</sentence><sentence id="343">I never sent the Jehovah Witnesses from my <span class="dlf">door</span>, never excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="344">May I have a tissue? </sentence><sentence id="345">This was first time that I saw some sparkle of humanity in this <span class="populated place">Gehenna</span>, in this hell that we were going through. </sentence><sentence id="346">They were gentle and they told us to hold on because the war will end and the good will come back. </sentence><sentence id="347">Going back to the <span class="dlf">triangles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">Pink were given to homosexuals, which Hitler didn't consider as pure German. </sentence><sentence id="349"> One of his <span class="spatial object">balonies</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="350">And we, the Jews, had red one with a yellow. </sentence><sentence id="351">Pure red one was political prisoner, but with yellow was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="352">We were on the lowest rank of this diabolical system. </sentence><sentence id="353">We were nothing. </sentence><sentence id="354">In this <span class="populated place">camp</span> there was niece of and Audette (ph), a French resistance fighter who was well known. </sentence><sentence id="355">They were kept separately because they were valuable to Germans as eventual exchange prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="356">We were there about four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="357">Our work to which we were assigned was carrying stones from one place to another and then back again. </sentence><sentence id="358">There was no purpose; it was hard; it was almost impossible; it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="359">We had no clothes. </sentence><sentence id="360">We had no food, but we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="361">One day there was announcement made that the people from our group are to assemble. </sentence><sentence id="362">We were being shipped somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="363">We were shipped again in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="364">We reached a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> on <span class="env feature">River Elbe</span>, which is in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">Of course, <span class="country">Germany</span>'s united now. </sentence><sentence id="366">At that time, it was the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367"><span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> was a medium- sized <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">The population of <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span> had two things that they were proud of. </sentence><sentence id="369">One of them was <span class="building">airplane factory</span> called <span class="building">Arado</span>, which produced a small <span class="spatial object">fighter plane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">And the other was the <span class="building">church</span> in which Martin Luther put the 95 theses to the <span class="dlf">door</span> of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">That was in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, so the <span class="populated place">city</span> had a deep religious background. </sentence><sentence id="372">However, this did not prevent the population of being cruel and less than human. </sentence><sentence id="373">We were placed in <span class="building">barracks</span>, numbered <span class="building">barracks</span>, and the only fortunate part of it was that we, the Jewish girls from our <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, were all in one <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">We were together. </sentence><sentence id="375">One lady amongst this group was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="376">She was about, I say, about four or five months pregnant, and we tried to shield her as much as possible because we were all so skinny. </sentence><sentence id="377">Because she was skinny even being pregnant because there was no nourishment there. </sentence><sentence id="378">Being on our own in this <span class="building">barrack</span> proved to one point was good that we selected the person who was in charge, and she was very fair. </sentence><sentence id="379">She cut the pieces of bread. </sentence><sentence id="380">The other <span class="building">barracks</span> had Germans. </sentence><sentence id="381">There was one German woman who came up once and hit me and broke five of my teeth. </sentence><sentence id="382">But it was all right because she was German, and I was a Jew, so I couldn't even report this. </sentence><sentence id="383">We were taken to this place because we were needed to work in the <span class="building">airplane factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">The previous group that worked there, I believe there was an accident, and they needed replacement. </sentence><sentence id="385">Since we were the meat they handled, we were sent there because there was a great supply of this. </sentence><sentence id="386">We had to get up at dawn. </sentence><sentence id="387">We were counted again on an <span class="building">Appell Platz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">And then we had to march to the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">The <span class="building">factory</span> was -- I don't remember how long was that march, but when we reached the <span class="building">factory</span>, we crossed a few <span class="dlf">streets</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">And the people who saw us walking were spitting at us. </sentence><sentence id="391">Children were taught that we are goddamn Jews, no good, dirty. </sentence><sentence id="392">We didn't look too appetizing; that's for sure. </sentence><sentence id="393">But did they ever think what the circumstances were that brought us to this point? </sentence><sentence id="394">Because I remember watching documentaries. </sentence><sentence id="395">How did the German soldiers look when they were in <span class="country">Russia</span> and they were being defeated and they walked through the <span class="env feature">snow</span> with the rags on their feet and rags on their heads? </sentence><sentence id="396">They didn't look any better than we did at this time, because they were being reduced to subhuman state. </sentence><sentence id="397">It is the circumstances that makes people look this way, and we were being made to look this way by other people. </sentence><sentence id="398">By other people who during the day beat us, tortured us, spit at us, killed us, and then went <span class="building">home</span> to their wives and children and dogs and played with them and ate their  dinner, and they never even gave a thought to what they did as what they considered work. </sentence><sentence id="399">The work became to them a hobby. </sentence><sentence id="400">They were being conditioned to like their work. </sentence><sentence id="401">They did not consider us as somebody who has brain equal or better than theirs. </sentence><sentence id="402">Who can think, who can feel, who can love, who can teach, who give and share good things with other people. </sentence><sentence id="403">The man who was in charge of our <span class="populated place">camp</span> lived right across from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was surrounded by <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> and had high <span class="building">towers</span> with machine guns manned by the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="404">When he left the <span class="populated place">camp</span> at sa certain hour, he had his God that he loved. </sentence><sentence id="405">He had children running around the place. </sentence><sentence id="406">I could never reconcile the fact that he was called a man, and I couldn't say that he was an animal because I like animals. </sentence><sentence id="407">Well, we marched through the <span class="populated place">city</span> to our <span class="building">place of work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">We were supposed to work for 12 hours straight. </sentence><sentence id="409">The work was divided into two 12-hour shifts: day shift manned by us, and night shift which was manned by the Russian prisoners of war who were kept somewhere there. </sentence><sentence id="410">I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="411">We were assigned to different parts of the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">They were called <span class="populated place">Halle</span> A, B, C, <span class="dlf">D</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="413">My misfortune was to be assigned to <span class="populated place">Halle Ha</span>, which is H. There were only a few of us that were assigned there. </sentence><sentence id="414">My supervisor was an elderly German man, so-called Meister, who knew that the war was being lost. </sentence><sentence id="415">It was 1945 already. </sentence><sentence id="416">He took his revenge on me. </sentence><sentence id="417">He beat me, stomped on me mercilessly. </sentence><sentence id="418">One day , the work in that particular place of work to which I was assigned was to rivet parts of the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, the <span class="dlf">wings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">I had a riveting gun, which was made of steel and was very heavy, and rivets. </sentence><sentence id="420">I had to put the rivets through two <span class="dlf">holes</span> to join the places, and they were spaced every so often. </sentence><sentence id="421">The work was very hard because it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="422">You can imagine how tremendous the place was for the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> being assembled. </sentence><sentence id="423">Huge, and it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="424">And the steel gun froze to the flesh of my hand when I was riveting. </sentence><sentence id="425">There were four of us that I knew that were in this place, H. One day I noticed a very tiny script on part of the <span class="interior space">wing</span> in a different script that I knew. </sentence><sentence id="426">It was a Russian script. </sentence><sentence id="427">And one person knew how to decipher this, and it was written there "Try if you can to skip every so often when you rivet and leave a little bit of <span class="dlf">opening</span>." </sentence><sentence id="428">Now, we realized that if we would do that, we risked death, but this was a lifesaver for us. </sentence><sentence id="429">We can do something positive because logically if the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>'s in the <span class="dlf">air</span>, the force of wind may force this rivet out because it's not completely sealed. </sentence><sentence id="430">And if enough of them would be blown out, the part would disintegrate. </sentence><sentence id="431">And we were delighted, and we started to do it. </sentence><sentence id="432">I did this for a little while, and one day I infected my finger with part of steel. </sentence><sentence id="433">And I knew that the infection was bad because I had a red stripe going up my arm and swollen glands underneath my armpit, so I knew that's bad. </sentence><sentence id="434">And here it was already March "45, going towards April. </sentence><sentence id="435">April, it was April. </sentence><sentence id="436">I don't recall the dates exactly, and my friend said, "You must survive." </sentence><sentence id="437">We could hear the sounds of war. </sentence><sentence id="438">We knew that the armies are coming closer and closer and closer because we were being sent more and more towards middle of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I developed high fever, so we had so-called <span class="building">Krankenrevier</span>, which is place the sick people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="440">Prior to this, they were taken away and shipped somewhere in <span class="populated place">Kiev</span>. </sentence><sentence id="441">But since this was already so late, they took me there and two of the prisoners amongst us, the Jewish group, were doctors. </sentence><sentence id="442">Two young lady doctors, and one of them Dr. Levine, who I don't know if she's still alive, pulled my nail without any anesthesia, without anything -- she had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="443">Pulled the nail off me and squeezed the pus. </sentence><sentence id="444">Normally, if this would happen here, if you don't have penicillin or streptomycin or antimycin, you probably die. </sentence><sentence id="445">I didn't die of it. </sentence><sentence id="446">It some sort of healed over. </sentence><sentence id="447">I had no nail. </sentence><sentence id="448">I had some straps all around it, I think, from the <span class="spatial object">dress</span>. </sentence><sentence id="449">I don't  0 remember what she wrapped around it. </sentence><sentence id="450">I was in pain. </sentence><sentence id="451">They permitted me to stay in this place for sick, and I was sitting in the <span class="dlf">corner</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">All the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were blackened because there were air raids already coming. </sentence><sentence id="453">And one day an SS woman came and she asked, "Who can knit?" </sentence><sentence id="454">And I said to myself I knew how to knit. </sentence><sentence id="455">I knew that properly brought girls were supposed to play <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, speak French and German, knit, and cook, besides the schoolwork. </sentence><sentence id="456">I knew how to knit, so I raised my hand. </sentence><sentence id="457">And she said, "I have to have a sweater within few days." </sentence><sentence id="458">And she brought me knitting needles and wool, and I was knitting without this finger, constantly. </sentence><sentence id="459">But she brought me soup and piece of bread for it. </sentence><sentence id="460">As I was knitting for few days, one day they came to the <span class="building">barrack</span>; they boarded the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="461">They didn't let anybody out. </sentence><sentence id="462">The Russians were already at the <span class="dlf">doors</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and the fighting was going on and we heard the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="463">We didn't know who was coming, but we knew whoever it is, it's the liberators. </sentence><sentence id="464">So to us, it didn't mean much. </sentence><sentence id="465">So we all stayed in the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="466">The plan was to destroy us, but they didn't have enough time. </sentence><sentence id="467">End of Tape #1  1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="850">Q: Just a minute. </sentence><sentence id="851">But what I think we should do is why don't you back up to the SS woman coming in saying, "Can anybody knit?" </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="856">Q: Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="858">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="859">The SS woman, a heavy, big woman, came to the place where we were, the few sick people, and asked if anybody can knit, and I thought that maybe this will help me to survive since I'm the one -- I'm still here. </sentence><sentence id="860">I said, "I can knit." </sentence><sentence id="861">I raised my hand and she brought knitting needles and wool and asked me to make her a sweater as fast as possible. </sentence><sentence id="862">Evidently, they wanted to shed their uniforms, which we found later on spread around there, and have civilian clothes on. </sentence><sentence id="863">They were big, heavy people; they had sticks with them to hit. </sentence><sentence id="864">And I started to knit in spite of my broken ribs and finger which was bandaged superficially and pain. </sentence><sentence id="865">I knitted and knitted. </sentence><sentence id="866">And she brought me some soup, some cold soup, and so- called bread, which was made with some sort of sawdust, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="867">And | ate very greedily, and I knitted the sweater until few days later, I found out that nobody could leave the <span class="building">barrack</span> because the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were boarded and so were the <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="868">And we didn't see through the <span class="dlf">cracks</span>, we didn't see anybody manning the <span class="building">towers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="869">The German soldiers were gone, so we realized that we are sentenced to be disposed of. </sentence><sentence id="870">It was almost a tonic. </sentence><sentence id="871">We heard the sounds of fight -- guns, couldn't identify what it was. </sentence><sentence id="872">The <span class="env feature">sky</span> was turning almost crimson red, and we were huddled. </sentence><sentence id="873">Then one of the girls who was very

class="populated place">sick place</span>, and they ran to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">What they found in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> were bars of margarine bars, and raw potatoes and couple of eggs. </sentence><sentence id="881">They scooped the margarine with their hands, and they brought two eggs and some potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="882">And since the <span class="dlf">door</span> was broken down, we decided to leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="883">My people took me by my arms and grabbed me, and we crossed the <span class="dlf">street</span> to where the commandant's <span class="building">house</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="884">Well, his <span class="building">house</span> was empty; he ran away with his family. </sentence><sentence id="885">So we went inside. </sentence><sentence id="886">There were six or seven of us -- seven, I think. </sentence><sentence id="887">How to cook the two eggs and divide, and the raw potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="888">While they were busy cooking and as they were cooking, the commandant came back with a cocked gun facing us, the seven of us. </sentence><sentence id="889">There was group of subhumans watching this man, this well-fed, big man with the gun, and he was afraid of us. </sentence><sentence id="890">It was -- if it wouldn't be so tragic, it would be comical. </sentence><sentence id="891">He backed out with the gun and he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="892">We decided it's not safe to stay there, so we started to run towards the fire because where the fire was coming from, whoever tried to liberate, was there fighting. </sentence><sentence id="893">As we were running, we encountered two young men. </sentence><sentence id="894">They happened to be Polish, and they were there not as prisoners, but they were taken from <span class="country">Poland</span> to work in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> because their young people and old people and whoever was capable was fighting. </sentence><sentence id="895">They needed people to work the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, and the two Polish people joined our group. </sentence><sentence id="896">One of the girls was killed by a piece of shrapnel in the very last moment before liberation. </sentence><sentence id="897">And the rest of us started to run toward  2 the fire. </sentence><sentence id="898">They were holding me all the way, and we reached a place -- it's another moment -- where a dirty, strange-looking man in filthy uniform with Asiatic-looking face, very tiny eyes, with a little cappy sort of a hat and big boots, and we realized that this is not a German at that time. </sentence><sentence id="899">We were ready to kiss his boots as filthy as he was, but he told us dawai, "In the back, in the back." </sentence><sentence id="900">We were so called liberated, we didn't know what was ahead of us yet. </sentence><sentence id="901">We went behind -- this is still the <span class="dlf">war line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="902">They are fighting -- go. </sentence><sentence id="903">Food, they had a bottle of herring. </sentence><sentence id="904">We started to eat this herring, one after another. </sentence><sentence id="905">And we were tremendously thirsty, and there was no water because the <span class="dlf">pipes</span> froze. </sentence><sentence id="906">We all got sick, very sick from it. </sentence><sentence id="907">See, the Russians are, I must say, very sturdy people. </sentence><sentence id="908">They were fighting eating the herring. </sentence><sentence id="909">It was incomprehensible to us, but that's the fact. </sentence><sentence id="910">And they told us to get away from there, so we started to go away. </sentence><sentence id="911">This was a <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="912">The <span class="populated place">village</span> was not touched. </sentence><sentence id="913">The little <span class="building">houses</span>, neat <span class="building">houses</span>, lovely <span class="dlf">gardens</span>, and sounds of starving animals because the Germans ran away and left the poor beasts unfed. </sentence><sentence id="914">They were running for life, so there were cows, there were pigs howling. </sentence><sentence id="915">We got to one of the <span class="building">houses</span>, and since the firing was going on both ways, we went to the <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="916">There were the two Polish guys and man and five girls, five women. </sentence><sentence id="917">We went to the <span class="interior space">basement</span> which was very well appointed. </sentence><sentence id="918">They had sleeping accommodation. </sentence><sentence id="919">They had <span class="interior space">shelves</span> stocked with jars with conserves, with meat, with whatever. </sentence><sentence id="920">And they had a <span class="spatial object">barrel</span> of <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="921">They were very well prepared. </sentence><sentence id="922">We ate and we lie down. </sentence><sentence id="923">The <span class="interior space">basement</span> was approachable by some sort of a <span class="dlf">door</span> which swings out and up and down, and in the middle of the night two Russians came and opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and came down. </sentence><sentence id="924">And they wanted women. </sentence><sentence id="925">I became hysterical because if I survived to this point, I don't want to live anymore. </sentence><sentence id="926">And I told one of the Polish men that if he would save me, I would do anything possible because my family's very influential. </sentence><sentence id="927">I thought they were alive. </sentence><sentence id="928">And he put me down on one of these wooden <span class="spatial object">benches</span>, which was prepared for sleeping and covered me and sat down on me. </sentence><sentence id="929">The other girls did the same. </sentence><sentence id="930">The third girl hid in a <span class="interior space">corner</span>, and two girls were raped. </sentence><sentence id="931">One of them is still alive that's in <span class="country">Israel</span>, but I understand that she's in a <span class="building">mental institution</span>. </sentence><sentence id="932">Once -- the demeanor of the Russian soldier is very difficult to describe now because we see them now after all these years of changes, these were people who were fighting the war. </sentence><sentence id="933">The closest I can identify them, they were grunzens (ph) or kalmucks??. </sentence><sentence id="934">They couldn't understand the difference, what's the difference? </sentence><sentence id="935">A woman's a woman; I mean, a woman. </sentence><sentence id="936">What's wrong? </sentence><sentence id="937">They were childlike. </sentence><sentence id="938">Here they were fighting, and here this is quite all right, everything. </sentence><sentence id="939">They drank whatever was there, and then one of them took a gun and started to shoot the <span class="spatial object">jars</span> with the fruit. </sentence><sentence id="940">And the pieces of glass and the red fluid from them started to seep all over, and I had glass embedded in my left leg throughout the winter because I wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="941">I reached that point. </sentence><sentence id="942">I was going to tell the world. </sentence><sentence id="943">I remembered my promise, so I had the glass in my leg and the red fluid all over me. </sentence><sentence id="944">And I was -- and the Polish young man was sitting on top of me, and that was till the morning. </sentence><sentence id="945">When the morning finally arrived, we decided to leave the place, and we walked, walked, walked to the next <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="946">Next <span class="populated place">village</span>, there were beautiful <span class="building">homes</span> all beautifully prepared. </sentence><sentence id="947">Food, chickens, <span class="country">china</span>. </sentence><sentence id="948">We went to the <span class="building">house</span> and we scouted it. </sentence><sentence id="949">We saw that there was an <span class="interior space">attic</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="950">So we ate. </sentence><sentence id="951">I remember the two young Polish guys were running up to the chickens with a stick to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="952">We cooked the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="953">We ate. </sentence><sentence id="954">We took the china with the tablecloth, threw out of the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="955">We weren't going to save anything there. </sentence><sentence id="956">This was our little revenge. </sentence><sentence id="957">Silly as it might sound now. </sentence><sentence id="958">We decided we would sleep in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="959">We took the <span class="dlf">ladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="960">We  3 climbed the <span class="dlf">ladder</span> and slept quietly in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="961">One of the girls was a little bit different. </sentence><sentence id="962">She decided she liked one of the Russian officers, so she stayed <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>, and she went with him wherever she wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="963">In the middle of the night, we went to -- we were alone on the top in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="964">The two Polish younb men are sleeping in one of the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> downstairs, and we hear German voices. </sentence><sentence id="965">It seems the <span class="building">houses</span> were facing a young <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and there were Germans hiding in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="966">They were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="967">They wanted to get some food. </sentence><sentence id="968">They got to our <span class="building">house</span> to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and they were eating food in our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="969">So we were very frightened, even though we were in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="970">We went underneath the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="971">They had a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> there <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="972">We went underneath the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="973">One of the girls could not hold her bladder from fear, and that's how we were lying in it. </sentence><sentence id="974">And two Polish young men jumped out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> because there was low part there, and they went to the Russians wherever they were. </sentence><sentence id="975">They had already so-called stabilized the place, and they told them that there were Germans in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">So the Russians came over, and we hear them outside. " </sentence><sentence id="977">Let's throw grenades," or whatever the name is of it. </sentence><sentence id="978">They were going to kill the Germans or dynamite the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">They didn't care about <span class="dlf">property</span> either. </sentence><sentence id="980">But here we are, four of us, under the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="981">So we started to scream, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="982">There are Polish people here. </sentence><sentence id="983">There are Polish people here." </sentence><sentence id="984">The two Germans opened the <span class="dlf">kitchen door</span> and started to run to the <span class="dlf">garden</span>, and they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="985">They were lying there for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="986">Each one of us took something from the German body.[had a pair of scissors, little scissors that he had on his body. </sentence><sentence id="987">I still have them. </sentence><sentence id="988">The next day there were French prisoners, ex-prisoners of war, who lived in another <span class="building">house</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="989">Now, I could communicate with them, and I told them that I'm scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="990">The other girls decided they want to go back to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="991">I was afraid to make one step outside. </sentence><sentence id="992">So the French people invited me to stay with them, and that's how I parted company with the Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="993">And I went to the <span class="building">French house</span>, and they said they would protect me; they did it. </sentence><sentence id="994">Each one is a separate story, and there are numbers of them. </sentence><sentence id="995">Numbers. </sentence><sentence id="996">Because the brain is supposed to be a storage of all these things, but yet it's almost impossible. </sentence><sentence id="997">There are things that I omitted. </sentence><sentence id="998">There are things that are coming back now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1151">Q: And your mother was with you for how long, and what happened to your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1153">A: My mother was with me until we worked in that -- until <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span>, and then she was taken somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1154">My mother was taken away from me in <span class="populated place">Wittenberg</span>, and I didn't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I found her after the war in <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span> <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, which was another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and she was already mortally ill and she passed away. </sentence><sentence id="1156">If somebody was not capable of carrying the work, they were useless to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And even though she was quite young,  4 she was 42 years old, but she had swollen legs. </sentence><sentence id="1158">She was skeleton-like. </sentence><sentence id="1159">She deteriorated very badly. </sentence><sentence id="1160">She was useless. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1181">Q: In the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, tell me what you used as a support system. </sentence><sentence id="1182">Did you use your imagination? </sentence><sentence id="1183">Tell me about what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1187">A: My <span class="spatial object">support system</span> was very much the family background. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The basis that I was given from my family. </sentence><sentence id="1189">The love, the support, the thirst for education and living, and, most of all, the promise that we would try to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1190">We would try to bear witness. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We would try no matter what and how, even if it would require something that is out of ordinary. </sentence><sentence id="1192">For instance, my grandmother was an observant Jewess. </sentence><sentence id="1193">We were not, but she was. </sentence><sentence id="1194">She was not supposed to eat meat that was not slaughtered in a certain way. </sentence><sentence id="1195">She was not supposed to eat horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="1196">But when we were in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in the beginning, they were sending some sort of horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And she ate it because, as I understand, our religion teaches that in order to survive if you are very sick there are certain things that are permissible and this was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Like an absolution, she ate horse meat which would be unthinkable under normal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1199">So the thirst of being here, surviving, and telling the people -- you have no idea how very much I look toward today, the moment that I can share some of my experiences to leave behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1200">To be part of the oral history, I will feel that I accomplished something very important. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I am more than delighted that this <span class="building">museum</span> came into being. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I feel that it's a tremendous tool for all humanity, that it is the most necessary tool to teach people of all persuasions that such a thing must never happen again to any people anywhere, anytime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: In the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, religious practices were forbidden, I assume, and did you witness any? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A: As I previously said, I was not brought up religiously. </sentence><sentence id="1222">My religion was mainly the tradition of our people, and we were invited by grandparents for the observant holidays that we shared together. </sentence><sentence id="1223">I loved them. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I loved them; I observed the tradition. </sentence><sentence id="1225">It's still something that will stay with me and something that my daughter now values and my granddaughter. </sentence><sentence id="1226">She said to me, my granddaughter, which is the future -- the young person that will carry on. </sentence><sentence id="1227">She said, "Nanna, no matter who I will marry, I will remember my background, and I will always carry on in my heart and life the thought of who you were, who we are, and what has to be  5 done." </sentence><sentence id="1228">So this is like carrying the <span class="spatial object">torch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1229">It is, to me, religion, and the religion observances are not as necessary as in my heart I feel I am a righteous person. </sentence><sentence id="1230">That's what my father taught me. </sentence><sentence id="1231">My father said that God surrounds us all, no matter what his name or image is. </sentence><sentence id="1232">God is in every blade of <span class="env feature">grass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1233">God is in every <span class="env feature">river</span> that flows. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And if I observe the commandments, which all of us should, then I am a religious person. </sentence><sentence id="1235">There were some people who would have liked to have observed candlelighting or somebody that would have it. </sentence><sentence id="1236">In <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, there are still some candles which my grandmother had. </sentence><sentence id="1237">But later on, we didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I didn't even -- I was not even aware which day this is, what holiday, what day. </sentence><sentence id="1239">The days were melting into one another. </sentence><sentence id="1240">You were not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="1241">You were busy trying to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

then they went to the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2348">To survive in <span class="populated place">camps</span> for that many years, you have to do things, all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="2349">You have to be brutal. </sentence><sentence id="2350">You have to have some sort of position there. </sentence><sentence id="2351">You have to bribe. </sentence><sentence id="2352">In that way we were very innocent. </sentence><sentence id="2353">We were completely unaware of anything when we first came there. </sentence><sentence id="2354">Our experience with the selection, we had to stand naked in front of the -- I don't know -- doctor or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2355">You couldn't have a pimple on your body. </sentence><sentence id="2356">You had to be perfect for work, and then looking for the jewels, the vaginal experiments that -- it was -- the hell started right there. </sentence><sentence id="2357">We were stripped of every, every human trace of behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2358">The brutality, the killing, the siccing the dogs -- the dogs were sicced at the people. </sentence><sentence id="2359">They were ripping the people apart with the exception of me, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And they had pleasure, the people liked to look at it. </sentence><sentence id="2361">The same people who lived a normal life outside of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2362">They had two kinds of life, and they completely reconciled with it. </sentence><sentence id="2363">It was their work, and as they cleaned up in the war, they were assigned to it. </sentence><sentence id="2364">But they embellished their love of it. </sentence><sentence id="2365">They did it with pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="2366">They didn't have to sometimes to do things that they did, but it became a badge of honor. </sentence><sentence id="2367">Human beings reduced to beasts, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2368">To preserve sanity, to function after  8 surviving this war, I don't think that we are 100 percent, but we try to pull on our reserves from our background, from our civilized way of living, from our teachings, our parents, and our teachers. </sentence><sentence id="2369">We try to create environment for us, ourselves, for our children, and we try to share our knowledge and forewarn future generations of the horror of what human beings are capable of. </sentence><sentence id="2370">That we must be on guard. </sentence><sentence id="2371">We must protect. </sentence><sentence id="2372">We must speak up. </sentence><sentence id="2373">Like Pastor Niemoeller said in his very famous speech, which I don't remember verbatim, but he said, "First, they came for the cripples, and I said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2374">Then, they came for the Communists, and I said nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2375">Then, they came for the Catholics, I said" -- I don't remember completely. </sentence><sentence id="2376">"Then, they came for the Jews, and I said nothing because I was not one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Then, they came for me, and there was nobody to speak up for me." </sentence><sentence id="2378">That's why we must have the red flag. </sentence><sentence id="2379">We must teach, we must educate, we must do the very least we can and we are capable of. </sentence><sentence id="2380">This is one of the reasons why I wanted so badly to come here and to speak up in my own little way to contribute from my past, from my knowledge, from my experience, from my broken down body. </sentence><sentence id="2381">To tell the people the horror, the tragedy, the Gehenna that we went through must never happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
