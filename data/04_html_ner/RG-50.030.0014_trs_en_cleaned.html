<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="327">What do you remember of that <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared meant because we hadn't experienced anything bad. </sentence><sentence id="331">So it was a little bit of an excitement for me. </sentence><sentence id="332">And I also think we did have one <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> along, but I am not 100 percent sure. </sentence><sentence id="333">But I just knew that nobody stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="334">Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to inspect it. </sentence><sentence id="335">Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports. </sentence><sentence id="336">It wasn't -- didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="337">The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they would -- they came to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> to ask for us. </sentence><sentence id="338">That I know and I know that our maid said when she opened the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="339">They knocked, Friday night, on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">We weren't <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">This is just what we heard. </sentence><sentence id="342">They knocked on everybody's <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">They had a list from the <span class="building">synagogue</span> about all the Jews, where we lived and she said -- when she opened and asked for us, she said, "They wouldn't be so stupid to stay <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="344">And she just closed the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">They didn't go in. </sentence><sentence id="346">They didn't -- maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">They left everything intact. </sentence><sentence id="348">And as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am wondering if I should continue. </sentence><sentence id="349">My father had bought a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">We lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the <span class="populated place">suburb</span> of <span class="country">Denmark</span> [<span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>], and he had bought a <span class="building">house</span> meanwhile. </sentence><sentence id="351">But we didn't get to move into it and when, when we came back from <span class="country">Sweden</span>, we moved into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">It was furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that woman married a German soldier or Kommandant." </sentence><sentence id="353">So when we came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="country">Sweden</span> -- my memories are coming back now -- there were Hitler's picture all over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">And the movers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all the pictures down from the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and you know they were very angry. </sentence><sentence id="355">But otherwise the <span class="building">house</span> was standing and, you know, a lot of <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> was there and then we moved into when we came back from <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="384">Let's go back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: Meanwhile, let's go back to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride. </sentence><sentence id="388">We were on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride. </sentence><sentence id="389">It takes about 30 minutes, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride from <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> to <span class="populated place">Snekkersten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">I don't know why my father knew to get off at from <span class="populated place">Snekkersten</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, and we got off the <span class="building">train station</span>, went down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>, you know, out off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and a man comes to us. </sentence><sentence id="392">Tall, I don't remember his face exactly. </sentence><sentence id="393">He was -- he looked he would be about 40 years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="394">And he said, "I know why you are here. </sentence><sentence id="395">I am Mr. Bagge, Herr Bagge.* </sentence><sentence id="396">Please come with me." </sentence><sentence id="397">And we just followed him and we came into a big white <span class="building">house</span> and he said, "Just stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="398">I'll take care of you "til we find you a <span class="spatial object">fishing boat</span> to take you to <span class="country">Sweden</span>." </sentence><sentence id="399">And he took about a week. </sentence><sentence id="400">We stayed there and you know, we had -- it was <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">We stayed in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">And everyday -- my father's blond so he didn't look Jewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go -- I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't have gone. </sentence><sentence id="403">But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the -- to see if you could get a <span class="spatial object">fishing boat</span> to take us to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="404">You know, you had to get a man that would take us and pay and everything. </sentence><sentence id="405">And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="406">And one day my father came <span class="building">home</span> and said he got a <span class="spatial object">rowboat</span> instead. </sentence><sentence id="407">He couldn't get a <span class="spatial object">fishing boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">He got a <span class="spatial object">rowboat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="409">So we would go that night. </sentence><sentence id="410">And we all got dressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man. </sentence><sentence id="411">And they said that --I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the night before and he couldn't row again he said. </sentence><sentence id="412">So we couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="413">And then, I think it took one or two more days, my father came back and he said -- I mean, he came back every time with Mr. Bagge -- that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="414">It was during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I was told later on that the Germans were paid off. </sentence><sentence id="415">So, the Germans that were guarding the <span class="dlf">harbor</span>, it was a <span class="dlf">harbor</span>, wouldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="416">So that day we just walked down from Mr.Bagge's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="417">I remember when we left, I remember his <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> had a big <span class="dlf">picture window</span> &gt;
