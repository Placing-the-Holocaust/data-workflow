" </sentence><sentence id="725">Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="726">So he went back to the Russian authorities. </sentence><sentence id="727">I think that's how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="728">And says, "Look, I don't need any visas. </sentence><sentence id="729">I can go." </sentence><sentence id="730">He says, "Show it. </sentence><sentence id="731">Prove it to us." </sentence><sentence id="732">He went back to the <span class="building">Dutch consul</span>; and the Dutch consul [he] told, "Look, give me a paper saying that according to the regulations there is no need for visas to enter <span class="populated place">Curacao</span> or <span class="populated place">Surinam</span> in <span class="region">Dutch West Indies</span>, and subject to the permission from the Governor, the Dutch Governor of <span class="populated place">Curagao</span>." </sentence><sentence id="733">And he gave him that, he wrote it down with a stamp. </sentence><sentence id="734">That was all he needed. </sentence><sentence id="735">He went there and said, "Here. </sentence><sentence id="736">I can go. </sentence><sentence id="737">Here is the <span class="spatial object">stamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="738">Here is the proof that there is no need for a visa." </sentence><sentence id="739">He says, "Alright. </sentence><sentence id="740">We will give you the exit visa. </sentence><sentence id="741">How are you going to go?" </sentence><sentence id="742">Need a Japanese transit visa to travel across <span class="country">Russia</span> to <span class="country">Japan</span>, and from <span class="country">Japan</span> to take a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, you see. </sentence><sentence id="743">So he went to the Japanese, and that's how it all started. </sentence><sentence id="744">The Japanese consul started to give them visas. </sentence><sentence id="745">They were standing there... You know, news spread very fast. </sentence><sentence id="746">They started going, they were standing there day and night for their turn to get those visas. </sentence><sentence id="747">First the Dutch stamp, then the...the...the uh...the Japanese visa. </sentence><sentence id="748">And this man Sugihara, the Japanese consul, he got instructions from his people in <span class="populated place">Tokyo</span>, "Stop issuing visas." </sentence><sentence id="749">But he didn't listen to them. </sentence><sentence id="750">He actually saved the people. </sentence><sentence id="751">I mean, part of the whole picture, you see. </sentence><sentence id="752">He was very important. </sentence><sentence id="753">Why did he do it? </sentence><sentence id="754">I met him after the war in <span class="country">Japan</span>, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="755">He uh...he said, "I don't think they can leave this <span class="country">country</span> anyway. </sentence><sentence id="756">So let them have some peace of mind. </sentence><sentence id="757">I'll give them the visas." </sentence><sentence id="758">Now with the Dutch consul, according to this book that I just brought to show it to you--the one written by the Rabbi*--the Dutch consul had a...a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="759">A German man, who eventually joined the German uh SA. </sentence><sentence id="760">The...the... You know. </sentence><sentence id="761">He...his job was to give to the consul the background of each uh...each person who applied for a Dutch, for that Dutch stamp, you see. </sentence><sentence id="762">And uh uh he was a German; but he was very sympathetic to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="763">And the reason is, according to this book, is he had a Jewish girlfriend when he was in <span class="country">Germany</span>.
