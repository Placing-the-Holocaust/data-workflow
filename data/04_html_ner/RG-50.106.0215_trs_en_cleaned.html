to where we lived on <span class="dlf">Martin Luther Strasse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">And so I just really don't remember very much about my -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: What did you do after <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="236">Were you interested in sports? </sentence><sentence id="237">Did you have any hobbies? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Iwas at my <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, I was interested in sports. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was swimming and <span class="dlf">track</span> which I participated in. </sentence><sentence id="240">I was never very good at it. </sentence><sentence id="241">No, I had what you call letters in it and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="242">But the one thing that I remember very, very closely is right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from us lived our physical ed teacher who was an officer in the SS, who took to me. </sentence><sentence id="243">I was the best marcher. </sentence><sentence id="244">You know when we marched and I also was the best saluter. </sentence><sentence id="245">And he was a very friendly to me. </sentence><sentence id="246">He lived right across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">And every once in a while he wore his SS uniform. </sentence><sentence id="248">But I had absolutely no fear or any kind of, other than that he was one of my teachers and he was friendly with me. </sentence><sentence id="249">And I really didn't feel any kind of persecution or otherwise until I was told that you had to leave the <span class="building">Hohenzollern gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I was very disappointed because it was a very good <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was close to where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="252">And I had to go to the <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>, way across <span class="populated place">town</span> and I bicycled. </sentence><sentence id="253">But this was a really relatively short time. </sentence><sentence id="254">What happened was after my father died in 1936, my mother took over his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">We lived happily in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">In 1937 her first cousin who lived, from <span class="populated place">Kansas City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">They came to <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">They didn't come to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">They met in <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">My mother went down. </sentence><sentence id="261">She didn't take me along and I really don't know why because she sent me off to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">And they met in <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span> in 1937. </sentence><sentence id="263">It was her first cousin. </sentence><sentence id="264">Interestingly about her first cousin who emigrated to the <span class="country">United States</span> before World War I as a young person. </sentence><sentence id="265">He had worked for my grandfather and somehow he had gotten into financial trouble. </sentence><sentence id="266">So my grandfather said get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="267">I'll pay you to go to the <span class="country">United States</span> and sent him abroad in order to keep him out of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="268">He never forgot that what my grandfather had done for him. </sentence><sentence id="269"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 9 And therefore, they came to <span class="country">Germany</span>, to <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span> to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And met. </sentence><sentence id="271">It was sort of a family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="272">He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to <span class="populated place">Marienbad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">And they made the decision that the following year I was to go to <span class="populated place">Kansas City</span> for one year and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year. </sentence><sentence id="274">Sort of be a <span class="building">family exchange</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">It developed during that following year he wasn't going to come but I was going to go for good. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I had an affidavit and I had a visa. </sentence><sentence id="277">My mother did not yet. </sentence><sentence id="278">She had, she had an affidavit from her cousin but she didn't have a visa yet. </sentence><sentence id="279">It hadn't come up yet. </sentence><sentence id="280">So I went by myself in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="281">She took me to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> and put me onto the <span class="spatial object">Manhattan ship</span> and I went off as a 14 year old to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">Yeah, but going back to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Stay with <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: That so I really I should say something else about <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">I am sure that if my father had lived we would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn't German. </sentence><sentence id="332">He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="333">So he was, this was never going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="334">We would have never left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and we would have all succumbed if he had not passed away. </sentence><sentence id="335">So this is one of the, my personal history that I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early age. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Let's now talk about you as a child in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">Did you experience any anti-Semitism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Only on one occasion and it was not really anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="347">It was the week before I left. </sentence><sentence id="348">My mother had purchased for me a pair of long trousers, knowing that in the <span class="country">United States</span> young boys wore knickers but also long trousers. </sentence><sentence id="349">And I had them on, was right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from where we lived and where I was accosted by four or five young boys who didn't like what I was wearing. </sentence><sentence id="350">Whether I was Jewish or not I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="351">And they beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="352">And I came <span class="building">home</span> and my mother, in her usual way, said this did you good so you had this experience of being beat up so you know what will happen to you if you know, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="353"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 10 And that was the only occasion that I personally felt it was, that I had any kind of bad experience in this. </sentence><sentence id="354">So I really never personally experienced the awful things that happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> vis a vis the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: When did you first start hearing about a man named Hitler? </sentence><sentence id="365">Do you remember your first impression? </sentence></p></dialogue>
