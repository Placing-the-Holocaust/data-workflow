<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: I went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">That was an old tradition. </sentence><sentence id="51">And uh on our <span class="building">school</span>, uh <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">That's , uh south of there in the must  <span class="building">Schoolmates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">There was no distinction between a Jew and a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="54">They were Danes and in our society there was no, you couldn't say that's a Jew, that's not a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: As you got older, uh what did you hear about uh if anything in the early thirties, uh mid- thirties, about <span class="country">Germany</span> and about Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: Uh well, the most I recall that <span class="country">Germany</span> always our enemy number one, and what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> was very very bad for <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">You know when you have the tiger at the <span class="dlf">doorstep</span> you have to be very careful of it. </sentence><sentence id="66">There was not the possibility to say quite a lot against him and probably - I can tell you that in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, uh the highest of the three percent who voted for Nazi parti.. the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="67">And we were neighbors so <span class="country">Denmark</span> is an old country with an old democratic tradition. </sentence><sentence id="68">Every form of dictatorship whether it is fascism, communism, that's that's not Danish. </sentence><sentence id="69">So I don't think - of course we were afraid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: How as a child, as a young chi... young boy, did you feel the fear and feel the concern? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: No, because we were foolish enough to believe when you have a non-aggression treaty with a man, he will keep it. </sentence><sentence id="79">That's the way we live. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Tell me about the German invasion, for you. </sentence><sentence id="83">What was it like? </sentence><sentence id="84">When did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Well, there was not a big change. </sentence><sentence id="119">The only thing happening which was really, you you saw it at the same time, was the black-out. </sentence><sentence id="120">From one day to another, you had to black- out. </sentence><sentence id="121"><span class="country">Denmark</span> was totally blacked-out. </sentence><sentence id="122">And maybe you'll understand how it was later to stand in the blacked-out <span class="dlf">beach</span> in <span class="country">Denmark</span> and look three miles over the <span class="env feature">straits</span>, the <span class="env feature">water</span> demarking <span class="country">Denmark</span> from <span class="country">Sweden</span>, where the lights were just like pearls on a string. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was so fantastic uh but the first thing there was the black-out. </sentence><sentence id="124">And then of course there were lack of goods and uh there was no connection with <span class="country">England</span> anymore, and our biggest trade partner and uh - but in the beginning the Germans tried to act just like  human beings. </sentence><sentence id="125">There was what, we should be the <span class="spatial object">model</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">We were the vikings, and we should be - I don't know what he wanted us to be - but there was not, you was not disturbed much by the Germans in the day-to-day, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: When did that change for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: Well, for me, you see we were shocked to lost our freedom and every resistance movement first part - I was only 15 when I started - it was to be a messenger boy. </sentence><sentence id="130">Deliver </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="133"> for papers. </sentence><sentence id="134">Illegal papers of course. </sentence><sentence id="135">Because the first thing you really noticed is that all the news are censored. </sentence><sentence id="136">You only hear what the Germans, the Germans wanted you to hear. </sentence><sentence id="137">And therefore it was important to keep the real messages, to give the real news and that was to be duplicated and brought out by boys like me and it is of elder people but that was the way we started and it was the beginning to the resistance movement in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, before the , before anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: How did you get recruited? </sentence></p></dialogue>
