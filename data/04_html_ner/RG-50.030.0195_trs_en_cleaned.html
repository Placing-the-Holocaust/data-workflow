</sentence><sentence id="146">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="147">No <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">They didn't open the <span

</sentence><sentence id="153">We stayed in the same place, night and day. </sentence><sentence id="154">Hygiene or not. </sentence><sentence id="155">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I

</sentence><sentence id="157">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="158">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now. </sentence><sentence id="159">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was. </sentence><sentence id="160">But we arrived...I think the place was called <span class="populated place">Yassinga</span> (ph) in the Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="161">We  got out from the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out. </sentence><sentence id="163">Most of the older

were taken. </sentence><sentence id="166">In <span class="populated place">Yassina</span> they put us on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in <span class="populated place">Kolomeia</span>, I think. </sentence><sentence id="167">I'm not sure of the names and the <span class="dlf">route</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a <span class="dlf">highway</span> they dropped us, you cannot come back. </sentence><sentence id="169">We will shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="170">You can only go inside, but from the inside Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way. </sentence><sentence id="171">You can only go back. </sentence><sentence id="172">We were on this on the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men. </sentence><sentence id="173">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and we walked away to the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and most of the people sat down. </sentence><sentence id="174">Now we were a big group of people, because wasn't only from our <span class="populated place">town</span> but it was from other <span class="populated place">towns</span> doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please. </sentence><sentence id="175">Please shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="176">At that time they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="177">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging. </sentence><sentence id="178">After a time...I don't know how much time. </sentence><sentence id="179">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="180">I can't say. </sentence><sentence id="181">They let us walk towards inside <span class="populated place">Galacia</span> (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a <span class="dlf">grave</span> at that time and they buried him. </sentence><sentence id="182">I don't know where it is, but there in that <span class="region">area</span> we also met people from <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span> that came at that time. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now they did not have places where to take us. </sentence><sentence id="184">We only walked. </sentence><sentence id="185">Not in <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Outside of the <span class="populated place">towns</span> by the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and we kept on walking, day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="187">No food. </sentence><sentence id="188">No <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="190">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="191">If we were lucky enough to be by a <span class="dlf">field</span> that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that. </sentence><sentence id="192">The shooting was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="193">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian . </sentence><sentence id="194">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or  We had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="195">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics  Saved her in the <span class="env feature">sea</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span> and she didn't know if she's alive or she is dead, that she sees somebody what she thought was dead and he said no, I am alive. </sentence><sentence id="196">Not only dead, under the dead, as he moved to get out after waiting a long time, he heard somebody else moving and his own son somehow did not get the bullets and they came out from under the dead. </sentence><sentence id="197">That was in <span class="populated place">Kamenitz-Podolsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">We heard that everybody was killed, not on all those machine guns andthe _ helped. </sentence><sentence id="199">We slowly walked back and we walked back...I have on the map marked out the <span class="populated place">towns</span> that we passed like <span class="populated place">Chortkov</span>, some other <span class="populated place">towns</span> on the way. </sentence><sentence id="200">We arrived in <span class="populated place">Stanislav</span>, one of the <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">I can give you the exact location...but I have it marked out here, and Stanislav...and we went into the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">There were still the Jews...in 1941 was fairly early. </sentence><sentence id="203">They didn't have the <span class="populated place">camps</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="204">I think the <span class="populated place">camps</span> started in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="205">And in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> my sister was very out- going and very smart, very talented, what she knew how to speak to people. </sentence><sentence id="206">Let's say she had a way, as a little girl, and a German officer gave us food from the officer's <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">For about three weeks we rested in <span class="populated place">Stanislav</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">Once or twice a day they gave us food from the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">And that was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="210">We kind of rested and built up some strength and then we went on to <span class="populated place">Nadvorna</span>, another <span class="populated place">town</span> on the way and in <span class="populated place">Nadvorna</span> we were invited to some Jewish family's also in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">These were all in <span class="country">Ukraine</span> naturally and we found in <span class="populated place">Nadvornia</span> a beggar that used to cross the <span class="env feature">Carpethian Mountains</span> to beg and he for jewelry that we had left was willing to take us across the <span class="env feature">Carpethian Mountains</span> back to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and he said it will take us two days from <span class="populated place">Nadvornia</span> walking and we started out. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was late autumn by that time, because it was before the Jewish holidays and however the two days turned into eight days. </sentence><sentence id="213">We got lost, with the guide together. </sentence><sentence id="214">I remember Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="215">My mother left burning candles in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> in there, just covered up for Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="216">We still believed that we . </sentence><sentence id="217">We still had to fast and we were still good Jews to observe  fear was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="218">They were afraid that if they let us stay out they will be taken away from their <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">Somehow we arrived very late autumn back in <span class="populated place">Slatina</span> where we lived, but we couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="220">They would have taken us away again. </sentence><sentence id="221">So I went to <span class="populated place">Nojvarod</span> which is in <span class="region">Transylvania</span> to my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="222">My sister went
