<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Well, we were three children and I was the oldest this and they called me Shari at the time. </sentence><sentence id="55">Yaffa is my new name in Hebrew and my sister who is fifteen months younger, Eva, and my brother was five years younger than me, was named Kalman Yoszef. </sentence><sentence id="56">We were children in the usual sense. </sentence><sentence id="57">We had a <span class="building">home</span>, a small <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">We were not very rich but we were comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="59">My mother was a very beautiful, immaculate woman, <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">01:03:  The children...very strict. </sentence><sentence id="61">They were very disciplinarian for the children. </sentence><sentence id="62">I remember hearing my mother say to her friend, you can't show children too much love because then you won't be able to discipline them. </sentence><sentence id="63">That's was the style at the time. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had to listen to our parents . </sentence><sentence id="65">My father, as I said, worked for the Czechoslovakian government. </sentence><sentence id="66">He also had parts in a <span class="building">butcher shop</span> or he went to the <span class="building">cattle markets</span> to help buy the cattle and by our <span class="building">home</span> we had a <span class="interior space">yard</span> with geese and chickens and a <span class="interior space">vegetable garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">As I remember the <span class="populated place">town</span> was divided. </sentence><sentence id="68">The <span class="region">lower part</span> was where the <span class="env feature">river</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="69">Then was the <span class="region">middle part</span> and then was up, the <span class="region">upper part</span> where the <span class="spatial object">Okno</span> ??_, </sentence><sentence id="70">where the <span class="dlf">mines</span>...there were <span class="dlf">salt mines</span> in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">We lived in the middle of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72"><span class="populated place">Slatina</span>, the part that I knew and most Jews know was the main <span class="dlf">street</span> with main <span class="building">stores</span> and they were mostly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="73">We hardly knew the Christians because they didn't live between us. </sentence><sentence id="74">We really separated ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was not a <span class="populated place">shtetle</span> atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="76">It was more because of the <span class="populated place">border town</span>, was more sophisticated, let's say than the <span class="populated place">shtetl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">However we Jews did stick together and we lived together and we were separated from the other people. </sentence><sentence id="78">My grandmother lived in... remember my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="79">She made a living off making popcorn over flames and selling (it in) newspapers made into cones. </sentence><sentence id="80">Our family lived in that <span class="populated place">town</span> for many...for quite a few generations. </sentence><sentence id="81">Naturally it was not the same nationality because the place changed hands and not the <span class="populated place">town</span> </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: We went to <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">Under Czechoslovakian government every...all children went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">However, let's say <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, <span class="building">high school</span> and things, that was percentages for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="115">The numerus clausus. </sentence><sentence id="116">Not all Jews could go because there was only certain percentage that could go...even under the democratic <span class="country">Czechoslovakians</span> it existed. </sentence><sentence id="117">So we all, all of us children did go to <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">01:06: We were mixed with Christian children, but there was never closeness with the Christian children and our Jewish children in our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was a beautiful <span class="dlf">park</span> that we used to go to because it was <span class="dlf">salt mines</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span>, and <span class="interior space">salt baths</span>, you know, for health purposes they had <span class="interior space">baths</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">They had beautiful <span class="dlf">parks</span> where we went sometimes to listen to music, but not always did we dare go because there were always bad times for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="121">I do remember as a young girl the Czechoslovakians had a <span class="building">sport complex</span> called <span class="populated place">Sokol</span> and they played tennis there and I just drooled. </sentence><sentence id="122">I wanted to play so terribly, and naturally I wouldn't have been accepted and we don't even try. </sentence><sentence id="123">I'm making up for it now. </sentence><sentence id="124">Again my father knew many <span class="country">Czechoslovakians</span> because he worked with them and the only intermingled my father used to go in once in a while in the <span class="building">billiard clubs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">At the time they played <span class="spatial object">billiards</span>, and he used to know a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="126">I remember one...my parent's anniversary was on Purim, the holiday, and he got drunk once a little and he ran into the mayor of the <span class="populated place">city</span> and we ran after him. </sentence><sentence id="127">We were kids. </sentence><sentence id="128">We didn't want him to because we were afraid, but he said, what is it you want from us Jews? </sentence><sentence id="129">What did we do to you? </sentence><sentence id="130">That was one occasion that sticks in my mind, but he was kind of a little fighter, my father, and that is  how we lived until 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: What happened in "<span class="populated place">38</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: In 1938...I don't know the dates or so...but the Czechs left. </sentence><sentence id="154">I remember they had colonies of beautiful <span class="building">homes</span>, the Czechoslovakian people, up on the upper part of <span class="populated place">town</span> and they left and the Ukrainians took over and I remember it only because we had to change <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">I mean the place was the same, but the language we had to change. </sentence><sentence id="156">We studied up till now in <span class="building">schools</span> Czech, and we had some good teachers, some not so good teachers, like every place else I would say. </sentence><sentence id="157">Now the __ were the Ukrainian fasc...uh fascists, like the SS the German, the _ the Hungarian, the ___ was the Ukrainian uh fascist organization, but in <span class="building">school</span> we started learning the alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="158">That's what Ukrainian use. </sentence><sentence id="159">We learned their anthem, their national anthem, , which J still remember, and uh but they...Ukrainian hated the Jews more than the Czechoslovaks. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was lots of fear and panic and sometimes they picked up some men and we never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh I only remember vaguely that there was a lot of panic around. </sentence><sentence id="162">Supposedly there was a list of about three hundred Jews, maybe not all in our <span class="populated place">town</span> or the surrounding <span class="region">area</span>, to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="163">Just a list of Jews to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="164">But it seems to me that as of the same time when the Jews were supposed to be killed, the Hungarians came in and took over and we were very happy that the Hungarians came in naturally. </sentence><sentence id="165">At least for a day or two we were happy, but then the atrocities started with the Hungarian army. </sentence><sentence id="166">Generally, it was accepted that armies marching in will commit atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="167">Ol:11: As kids we only heard that there were rapes and women tortured, breasts cut off...as children we heard those things happening. </sentence><sentence id="168">However we kind of for a while felt comfortable because they didn't kill all those Jews with the list and the Ukrainians were gone. </sentence><sentence id="169">Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the <span class="dlf">mines</span>, in the <span class="dlf">salt mines</span>, down deep in the <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we became very poor. </sentence><sentence id="171">However we were kind of proud people, my family. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat, and that we have nothing to cook with, but all in all, my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us, and somehow we survived that part too. </sentence><sentence id="173">And there were a lot of beatings from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="174">Sometimes they went around the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, the Hungarians, all the villagers together which were not pure Hungarians...they were mixed Romanians, Hungarians, Slaves, Ukrainians, even Shobs (ph) were around in the <span class="region">area</span> and whoever was in their way or whatever they felt like attacking, they attacked and they hurt and they killed and  01:13: they took what they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="175">My father worked in the <span class="dlf">mines</span> and he also tried to go to the <span class="building">cattle markets</span> to see if he can do some business because people still ate. </sentence><sentence id="176">There were still a lot of <span class="building">butchers</span> around and cattle and many times he came <span class="building">home</span> beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941, while my father was away in a <span class="building">market</span>, the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week, in a week we will be taken away, that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else, to someplace where there is work, in <span class="populated place">work camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">Now as I say, my father was not <span class="building">home</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="178">What my mother did at first is what every Jew, good Jew will do...take the children and go to the <span class="building">temple</span> and open the Torahs (ph) and cry and beg. ..... </sentence><sentence id="179">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="180">01:15: And we went <span class="building">home</span> and that evening when we came back from the <span class="building">temple</span>, there was a <span class="spatial object">cart</span> with horses in front of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">My father was brought <span class="building">home</span> beaten very severely and we took him in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">We did to him what we can and when my mother told him that we'll be taken away, she suggested we hide out and go to another place <span class="populated place">Sziget</span> or wherever and hide out, not to go. </sentence><sentence id="183">But my father felt it can't be any worse than it is. </sentence><sentence id="184">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="185">So we went. </sentence><sentence id="186">In a week's time everybody got a bundle. </sentence><sentence id="187">We took what we can. </sentence><sentence id="188">We were not allowed to take anything else except what we can carry. </sentence><sentence id="189">We went to the <span class="building">train station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">They packed us into in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">I don't know if there were seventy or a hundred or how many. </sentence><sentence id="192">I know there was no place to sit. </sentence><sentence id="193">We were able to somehow stand and I also cannot tell you how long we were in those <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">They were not fast, and they took us...we don't know how we traveled...the geography of it. </sentence><sentence id="195">I can look at some names on the maps and remember where we were, but I don't know how we traveled with the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and where the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> existed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Can you tell us about that <span class="spatial object">ride</span>? </sentence><sentence id="242">What was it like inside the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was hot and crowded. </sentence><sentence id="247">No <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="249">No <span class="interior space">toilets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">They didn't open the <span class="dlf">doors</span> for two, three days at a time. </sentence><sentence id="251">We had dead people in with us and when they stopped maybe every every three days when they stopped, we handed out the dead. </sentence><sentence id="252">They didn't let us do any hygiene or wash our clothes or anything. </sentence><sentence id="253">If you had some food with you, you ate something but you shared with your people that you were around, but there was no place to move. </sentence><sentence id="254">We kind of sat down everybody and where you could, but we really couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="255">We stayed in the same place, night and day. </sentence><sentence id="256">Hygiene or not. </sentence><sentence id="257">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I think the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> were put on <span class="dlf">side lines</span> and we stayed standing still. </sentence><sentence id="258">We were not always traveling. </sentence><sentence id="259">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="260">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now. </sentence><sentence id="261">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was. </sentence><sentence id="262">But we arrived...I think the place was called <span class="populated place">Yassinga</span> (ph) in the Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="263">We  got out from the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out. </sentence><sentence id="265">Most of the older people did go. </sentence><sentence id="266">Our grandmother stayed <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was my family, my father, mother and the three children that were taken. </sentence><sentence id="268">In <span class="populated place">Yassina</span> they put us on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in <span class="populated place">Kolomeia</span>, I think. </sentence><sentence id="269">I'm not sure of the names and the <span class="dlf">route</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a <span class="dlf">highway</span> they dropped us, you cannot come back. </sentence><sentence id="271">We will shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="272">You can only go inside, but from the inside Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way. </sentence><sentence id="273">You can only go back. </sentence><sentence id="274">We were on this on the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men. </sentence><sentence id="275">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and we walked away to the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and most of the people sat down. </sentence><sentence id="276">Now we were a big group of people, because wasn't only from our <span class="populated place">town</span> but it was from other <span class="populated place">towns</span> doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please. </sentence><sentence id="277">Please shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="278">At that time they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="279">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging. </sentence><sentence id="280">After a time...I don't know how much time. </sentence><sentence id="281">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="282">I can't say. </sentence><sentence id="283">They let us walk towards inside <span class="populated place">Galacia</span> (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a <span class="dlf">grave</span> at that time and they buried him. </sentence><sentence id="284">I don't know where it is, but there in that <span class="region">area</span> we also met people from <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span> that came at that time. </sentence><sentence id="285">Now they did not have places where to take us. </sentence><sentence id="286">We only walked. </sentence><sentence id="287">Not in <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">Outside of the <span class="populated place">towns</span> by the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and we kept on walking, day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="289">No food. </sentence><sentence id="290">No <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="291">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="292">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="293">If we were lucky enough to be by a <span class="dlf">field</span> that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that. </sentence><sentence id="294">The shooting was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="295">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian . </sentence><sentence id="296">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or they hit with the rifle or they shoot with the rifle. </sentence><sentence id="297">They gave us rest maybe once or twice a day, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="298">I don't know if it was twenty, twenty-five kilometers daily, children and older people. </sentence><sentence id="299">I remember there was a boy that walked next to us. </sentence><sentence id="300">It was a big <span class="spatial object">transport</span> by then...a few thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="301">He carried his sick old mother whose legs were very swollen, on his shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="302">He was young, about fifteen, sixteen year old boy...for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="303">Each time we rested he took her off the shoulder, put her down to rest. </sentence><sentence id="304">Then he got up, took her on the shoulder and carried her further and one day he didn't do it fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="305">They killed the mother right then and there, by the side. </sentence><sentence id="306">They wouldn't even give him time to bury her. </sentence><sentence id="307">01:24:  We had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="308">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics but very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="309">Very hateful towards us Jews. </sentence><sentence id="310">Some of them were happy to kill us and hit us and do the worst that they can do to people. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now at this time I only remember the walking and incidents that stand out. </sentence><sentence id="312">We came to a place, a small <span class="populated place">town</span> that there was a <span class="dlf">well</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">I see it in the <span class="region">middle</span> like. </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know where it was and what but it was a <span class="dlf">well</span> and we were like around the whole <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and the __ were standing close to the <span class="dlf">well</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">A little boy...to me he looked very little... went over to him. </sentence><sentence id="316">Said can I have <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">He said you want water, and the boy says please, water. </sentence><sentence id="318">He could hardly speak. </sentence><sentence id="319">And he took his rifle and shot him right there, next to him by his feet, because the boy wanted <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">And that picture is with me through the years. </sentence><sentence id="321">I I live with it. </sentence><sentence id="322">I mean I don't think about it all the time but it's there. </sentence><sentence id="323">Sometimes when we rested like next to the <span class="dlf">Dnjestr</span>, the <span class="env feature">River Dnjestr</span>, we rested and there was a little girl from <span class="populated place">Bukovina</span> with her brother, with a big tall brother and a girl about...I don't know...she was older than me. </sentence><sentence id="324">She was beautiful with gold earrings, big black braids she had and they dunked in the <span class="dlf">Dnjestr</span>, held her down. </sentence><sentence id="325">The two <span class="dlf">braids</span> were on top of the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">They dunked her down into the <span class="env feature">water</span> and held her and then they pulled her up and they did that a few times and then they brought her out. </sentence><sentence id="327">Same day they picked out when we were resting at night by the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, they picked out men. </sentence><sentence id="328">They took them away. </sentence><sentence id="329">I remember it well because we lay on my father. </sentence><sentence id="330">We covered him, the children and my mother covered my father so they don't see him, so they don't take him away. </sentence><sentence id="331">They took...picked out ten, fifteen, twenty men, almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="332">We never heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="333">We never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="334">They were killed. </sentence><sentence id="335">They were killed like there is no consideration at all. </sentence><sentence id="336">In <span class="spatial object">transport</span> after <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, wherever we went...killing old men in all way. </sentence><sentence id="337">And we walked that way until we came to <span class="populated place">Kamenitz- Podolsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="338"><span class="populated place">Kamenitz-Podolsk</span> was like a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, enclosed with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and we saw machine guns around the whole <span class="dlf">farm</span>, with the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> around and machine guns and as we entered in that corral a Wehrmacht officer said to my mother and father, if you don't run away you'll be dead. </sentence><sentence id="339">A Wehrmacht officer. </sentence><sentence id="340">So as we came in, there was a <span class="building">farm house</span> and most people from the big <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, many thousands of people came in and we slowly sneaked into that <span class="dlf">farm</span> in a very little <span class="interior space">room</span>, like a two by two size <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">My family of five. </sentence><sentence id="342">Some other people that we were twenty-two together, children and adults together, and we closed the <span

</sentence><sentence id="343">We saw their <span class="spatial object">machine guns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">I don't know how and why they searched. </sentence><sentence id="345">We heard them search <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, next to us, below us, every <span class="dlf">corner</span> that you can imagine we heard them. </sentence><sentence id="346">We don't know how long we sat there. </sentence><sentence id="347">It seemed to us like a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="348">And the children didn't cry and my brother was younger with five years and there were younger children even. </sentence><sentence id="349">We just sat, bundled all of us in that two by two <span class="interior space">cell</span> until it got dark outside, and they didn't find us. </sentence><sentence id="350">And somehow...the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, the <span class="dlf">wire fence</span> somehow didn't reach that <span class="building">house</span> and at night we we went out through that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">Out, and we ran away there, the twenty-two people. </sentence><sentence id="352">We heard later that they did kill most of the people because we know somebody that came out from under the dead, but I don't know if you want to hear this now or shall I go into this later. </sentence><sentence id="353">When my sister went to <span class="country">Israel</span> and she jumped from the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> so they don't take her away to <span

we walked back...I have on the map marked out the <span class="populated place">towns</span> that we passed like <span class="populated place">Chortkov</span>, some other <span class="populated

were still the Jews...in 1941 was fairly early. </sentence><sentence id="363">They didn't have the <span class="populated place">camps</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="364">I think the <span class="populated place">camps</span> started in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="365">And in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> my sister was very out- going and very smart, very talented, what she knew how to speak to people. </sentence><sentence id="366">Let's say she had a way, as a little girl, and a German officer gave us food from the officer's <span class="interior

food from the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">And that was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="370">We kind of rested and built up some strength and then we went on to <span class="populated place">Nadvorna</span>, another <span class="populated place">town</span> on the way and in <span class="populated place">Nadvorna</span> we were invited to some Jewish family's also in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">These were all in <span class="country">Ukraine</span> naturally and we found in <span class="populated

started out. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was late autumn by that time, because it was before the Jewish holidays and however the two days turned into eight days. </sentence><sentence id="373">We got lost, with the guide together. </sentence><sentence id="374">I remember Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="375">My mother left burning candles in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> in

</sentence><sentence id="387">They kept us alive. </sentence><sentence id="388">One day we were walking in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and all of a sudden my mother looked like she fell into something. </sentence><sentence id="389">It looked like it was a <span class="dlf">well</span> and it was not closed up. </sentence><sentence id="390">It was just like one piece of wood across the <span class="dlf">well</span>, and that one piece of wood saved my mother from falling into that <span class="dlf">well</span>, and we helped her up and we continued walking and we arrived in someplace in <span class="country">Hungary</span> across the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">I don't know the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="392">I know there were Jewish people there. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'm sad to say they wouldn't let us sleep in the <span class="building">barn</span>.

taken away from their <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="400">Somehow we arrived very late autumn back in <span class="populated place">Slatina</span> where we lived, but we couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="401">They would have taken us away again. </sentence><sentence id="402">So I went to <span class="populated place">Nojvarod</span> which is in <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: In the <span class="dlf">raceway</span>...it was just people. </sentence><sentence id="731">Just more and more people coming into the <span class="dlf">raceway</span> because they were gathering all the Jews from there. </sentence><sentence id="732">I haven't got a clear picture of it. </sentence><sentence id="733">I just know that we were put in certain <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, groups of people, and they started marching us towards the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Germany</span>, which naturally we don't...at this time I didn't even know that we're not bordering <span class="country">Germany</span>...we approach <span class="country">Austria</span>, and we marched in groups, but it seems to me that there were a lot of young people, because I remember I had experience from 1941 that I tried to gather young people and we sing  0 songs, most Hungarian, because Hungarian Jews didn't know any other language. </sentence><sentence id="734">I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="735">I knew other languages, but Hungarian Jews knew only Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="736">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="737">And we Started singing songs. </sentence><sentence id="738">It somehow kept the spirits going. </sentence><sentence id="739">I didn't think of it consciously at the time, but that's what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="740">And we walked and walked, but one good thing...in <span class="country">Hungary</span> the villagers and the people, they're not as bad and as cruel as in <span class="region">Galicia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="741">In <span class="country">Hungary</span> we sometimes, we were cute little girls, you know, go to a <span class="dlf">fence</span> and they will give us a bread or something to eat. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="742"> It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="743">It was for them too very bad. </sentence><sentence id="744">It was towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="745">There wasn't much left there either. </sentence><sentence id="746">But they once in a while did reach out and gave us some food and we came to a place called close to or ...1 can't even pronounce it. </sentence><sentence id="747">I have it marked out on the Hungarian map. </sentence><sentence id="748">There were <span class="spatial object">boats</span> on the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> and they...we settled in on those <span class="spatial object">boats</span> on the <span class="env feature">Danube</span> because they said that's where we have to wait for transportation to go to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">Dysentery broke out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="750">Diarrhea and stomach upset for the people. </sentence><sentence id="751">It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="752">Again, no hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="753">And I don't know how we survived and how we were on those <span class="spatial object">boats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="754">We were there about two, three weeks and there I heard that there was ..I don't think it was an order or a request...that children under thirteen should be returned to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, and by that time I was about close to sixteen, seventeen, and I said to my friend Francesca, who was with me at the time...now and again my sister lived in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> but she had Christian papers in her own name made. </sentence><sentence id="755">I don't know to whom or who did it. </sentence><sentence id="756">It could have been <span class="populated place">Wallenberg</span> or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="757">She had in her own name, Eva Joszef, Christian papers, and she lived out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">She didn't go to the <span class="dlf">raceway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="759">She stayed out. </sentence><sentence id="760">In between I tried to study in one of the <span class="interior space">basements</span> Catholic religion. </sentence><sentence id="761">They said that if you became Catholic, they will keep you alive. </sentence><sentence id="762">They will not take you away, so I studied the Catholic religion and then I found out it wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="763">I did not take on another religion. </sentence><sentence id="764">I stayed Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="765">So my sister was in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> someplace. </sentence><sentence id="766">I don't know where she was...safe supposedly with Christian papers. </sentence><sentence id="767">I was with Francesca, my girlfriend, Francesca Nemeth, and I said let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="768">I don't want to go to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">I know what they do to people there, and she didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="770">She was afraid and I begged her and kind of coerced her. </sentence><sentence id="771">I said you carry on, put your hair in braids and uh let's try and let's try and we we succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="772">We walked back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="773">I called Francesca. </sentence><sentence id="774">She lives in <span class="region">Ohio</span>, <span class="populated place">Cleveland</span>, <span class="region">Ohio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">I wondered if she remembers names or something. </sentence><sentence id="776">She does not remember anything, but she was just thanking me for keeping her alive, because she says that if not you, I wouldn't have been alive today. </sentence><sentence id="777">But at the time I just felt that this is our way of surviving, to go back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">We walked again back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">I don't know how many kilometers, how we did it. </sentence><sentence id="780">We were a small transport of children and we walked but while we were still on <span class="spatial

cooked the <span class="env feature">geese</span> and we gave the soup for the dysentery sick people, the soup, and we handed out meats for the children to eat, for the young children to eat.

</sentence><sentence id="784">Some got better. </sentence><sentence id="785">I don't know if it was from the soup or not, but that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="786">We went back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and we went into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, into a <span class="building">Red Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="787">I don't know if
