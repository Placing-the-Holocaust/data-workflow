<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Uh, I come from a family of three children. </sentence><sentence id="14">I had two brothers and I was the youngest, a girl, and my father was a businessman and we were sort of middle-class Jews in <span class="populated place">town</span> and, uh, I look back on my childhood as quite happy and, uh, even though there were a lot of dark clouds on the <span class="env feature">sky</span>, we children were always protected and and, uh, shielded sort of and, uh, had quite a happy life. </sentence><sentence id="15">| we thought so anyway. </sentence><sentence id="16">Until the... it really began to get bad and we started to hear all the the different rumors about, uh, what's happening all around us but we thought that maybe some people are exaggerating it and, uh, it would never happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="17">We are loyal Hungarian citizens and, uh, nobody would harm us. </sentence><sentence id="18">Our father, grandfathers fought for the <span class="country">country</span> and, uh, and, uh, it's really just scaring us with these things. </sentence><sentence id="19">But then in, uh, April, March actually, 1944, when the Germans came in, we had to put on the yellow star and Jews were not allowed to leave leave their <span class="building">houses</span> actually and, uh, we were not allowed to travel, have <span class="building">businesses</span> or go to <span class="building">school</span> or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="20">I mean we knew that it is happening. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is happening. </sentence><sentence id="22">And, uh, within a few weeks we were all rounded up and sent to a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in, uh, the nearest bigger <span class="populated place">town</span> named <span class="populated place">Kassa</span>" where we were in, uh, very bad circumstances already. </sentence><sentence id="23">No money was allowed to brought with, only certain amount and we had to leave all our possessions at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">Just everybody was allowed, uh, uh, backpack of some little clothes and and no food and no money and then we didn't, no, no future. </sentence><sentence id="25">Didn't know what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="26">As and surely enough, uh, we were, uh, there four weeks maybe in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> when the Germans took us out from the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Before we get to that, were you seeing a young man in the middle of all this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="44">I, I was, uh, quite, uh, popular (laughter) and, and, uh, seeing we were ri...as I said we had a very social life and, and, and very happy life ina way. </sentence><sentence id="45">When we were not, we  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection couldn't go to, we couldn't go to, uh, the movies so we entertained ourselves at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">I mean we tried to make the best of a bad situation and, uh, this certain young man was, uh, more attentive than others and (laughter) we sort of became semi-officially engaged. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh, he had to go off to the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span>, but, uh, we promised each other that if we both come back, we going to get married someday. </sentence><sentence id="48">But that was, uh, a very iffy situation of course because you really didn't know what was going on, but but when you're young you don't really think that way. </sentence><sentence id="49">Imean you don't really think you're going to die. </sentence><sentence id="50">You may say it, but, but it doesn't feel like, you know, you don't feel it. </sentence><sentence id="51">You don't realize it what the word really means. </sentence><sentence id="52">So we (pause) going back to back going back to <span class="populated place">Kassa</span>, one, one, uh, day the Germans brought in these, uh, <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and we were rounded up, I think eighty of us in a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, old and young and and sick and, uh, crying and and, uh, even whatever little we had they took away from us. </sentence><sentence id="53">No food. </sentence><sentence id="54">And the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were locked on us and was, everybody was looking out under little <span class="dlf">windows</span> in the <span class="dlf">cracks</span> which way we're heading, because nobody told us anything. </sentence><sentence id="55">I mean we, everything was rumored but no...nobody said you're going here or you're going there and we thought we're going to work. </sentence><sentence id="56">Everybody said, oh, you're going to work so it's not the worst thing. </sentence><sentence id="57">We're going to work but, uh, my father sort of, uh, he was, uh, we called him a pessimist. ( </sentence><sentence id="58">laughter) He he felt that he knew what that that it's going to be terrible and, uh, he said that we're heading for the, out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">I mean because if we were going to work, they would have bring us to the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="60">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> would go to the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="61">And, uh, sure enough, in three days time--it took us, wait a minute, three days--yes, three days to arrive to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Tell me about that trip. </sentence><sentence id="83">What was the trip like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: Well, you hardly could sit down in the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and, uh, and, uh, I don't even remember having any food. </sentence><sentence id="87">We must have some food with us but, uh, I don't really recall recall it. </sentence><sentence id="88">And, uh, some people were sick, really out of their mind, old people, senile people and they were crying and yelling all night long and if somebody had to go to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, then then there was a little, uh, little <span class="spatial object">pail</span> there, and everybody, men and women together, everybody, uh, seeing that you're going to the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">It's, it was just so humiliating, humiliating and, and, uh, horrible. </sentence><sentence id="90">So all they can do is cry or pray or or or try to soothe each other and, and sitting down on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and and mothers with their children and, uh, resting in their heads in their lap and it was just an awful trip. </sentence><sentence id="91">And, uh, little did we know that at least we were together. </sentence><sentence id="92">As soon as we arrived to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, uh, they were waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="93">We didn't know what <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was or where we were and was all of a sudden they opened the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and these these, uh, men with, uh, striped uniforms started to drag us out and the Germans, uh, patrolling with their German Shepherds and and yelling, " 2 , schnell,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and she said, "<span class="populated place">Vierzig</span>" [<span class="country">GER</span>: forty] That's all she was. </sentence><sentence id="94">And he sent her to the other side.(Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet. </sentence><sentence id="95">I mean we had no idea of, of, uh, what was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="96">And then they told us that you're going to see them later, that you're going to see them at night. </sentence><sentence id="97">They're taking the young people to work and, uh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together. </sentence><sentence id="98">Uh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us. </sentence><sentence id="99">I remember some who were twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to step aside. </sentence><sentence id="100">They wanted. </sentence><sentence id="101">The rest of us were marched to the <span class="interior space">bath</span>, to, to take a <span class="interior space">shower</span>, to a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to find them, and they brought us into this huge <span class="interior space">room</span> where the <span class="interior space">showers</span> were overhead and they locked the <span class="dlf">doors</span> on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out. </sentence><sentence id="103">Little did we know that our parents got the same <span class="interior space">showers</span> with the gas on. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh, when we came out from the <span class="spatial object">showers</span> we came out on the other <span class="dlf">door</span> so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or anything. </sentence><sentence id="105">Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey cotton dress. </sentence><sentence id="106">No underwear. </sentence><sentence id="107">I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet, wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="108">And we were marched into a <span class="building">barrack</span> where there were these, uh, so-called <span class="spatial object">bleachers</span> (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Twelve of us on one, so if one turned around, all twelve had to turn. </sentence><sentence id="110">Uh, one bow! </sentence><sentence id="111">of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup or anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others. </sentence><sentence id="112">And, uh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, were our Blockiltesters. </sentence><sentence id="113">They were the overseers. </sentence><sentence id="114">And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see your parents again. </sentence><sentence id="115">You might as well forget about it because they are already in the, marched into the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest dream that that something like this could happen. </sentence><sentence id="117">We thought they were just, uh, being tude to us. </sentence><sentence id="118">They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they were for so many years already. </sentence><sentence id="119">And, uh, we just shrugged it off. </sentence><sentence id="120">We we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer, volunteer for anything. </sentence><sentence id="121">Go out of here. </sentence><sentence id="122">This is a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, and, and, uh, the farther you get away from it the better it is. </sentence><sentence id="123">So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were coming in day and night from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Actually I was in the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to leave <span class="country">Hungary</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and, uh, day and night they were bringing in people and even the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for the newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="126">We were sent to, uh, <span class="populated place">Cracow</span>, <span class="populated place">P_aszow</span> the <span class="dlf">Lager</span> was called. </sentence><sentence id="127">It was the most horrible place on earth. </sentence><sentence id="128">I think it was worse than <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, even though it had no <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">But we worked very, very hard there. </sentence><sentence id="130">Four o'clock in the morning we had to get up to for Zahlappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for hours under the <span class="env feature">stars</span> in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="131">This was in May,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection but it was in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and everybody was cold. </sentence><sentence id="132">And, uh, staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out to work. </sentence><sentence id="133">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was situated on a, on a <span class="env feature">mountainside</span> and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done "schnell" and, uh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast. </sentence><sentence id="135">Now when you have a three size too big pair of <span class="spatial object">shoes</span> on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy and and go up on the <span class="env feature">mountainside</span>, it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all day long. </sentence><sentence id="136">And by the time we came back <span class="building">home</span> on the other side of the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, uh, sometimes the food ran out already. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some soup with, uh, some barley, barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="138">That was our mainstay for three months, every single day. </sentence><sentence id="139">Barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="140">And, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it was very cold there in them. </sentence><sentence id="141">We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we realized it, it was full of lice, this clothes. </sentence><sentence id="142">So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide from the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; it was, uh, we suffered a lot there from, from, uh, from the other people. </sentence><sentence id="143">From the other <span class="populated place">camp-mates</span> who were, who were not, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming from, from our, our, uh, <span class="building">homes</span> and they were already suffering for years and years and they thought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="144">We don't belong. </sentence><sentence id="145">But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the partisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and, and the front was coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there. </sentence><sentence id="146">And we were sent, we were sent back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">Of course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> betwe...between <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="populated place">Cracow</span>, the distance should be three hours. </sentence><sentence id="148">It took us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August Sth I remember. </sentence><sentence id="149">Hundred and thirty us of us in one <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed off and I, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on my head. </sentence><sentence id="151">I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out with a <span class="spatial object">covered wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">How can it be raining? </sentence><sentence id="153">Until I found out that the humidity in the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> was so high that it was coming down in drops from the <span class="interior space">ceiling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">We had absolutely no <span class="env feature">water</span>, no food, no <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="155">After three days when we finally arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="dlf">wagon doors</span>, we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we're perhaps going to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, and this will be the end of our journey. ( </sentence><sentence id="156">Pause) Uh, but we didn't go to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">We went back to another lag...uh, <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I think it was the <span class="populated place">C Lager</span> they called it. </sentence><sentence id="159">And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was shaved. </sentence><sentence id="160">Before they didn't have time because usually when a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> arrives, the women are all shaved. </sentence><sentence id="161">Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...it didn't, they were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like Itold you. </sentence><sentence id="162">And, uh, they tattooed me. </sentence><sentence id="163">This was just another...we really didn't care at that point. </sentence><sentence id="164">We didn't think that that we, we, we really ex...ceased to be human beings. </sentence><sentence id="165">We were just a number already but who care...mean it was beyond us already. </sentence><sentence id="166">And, uh, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="167">It was just a transport <span class="spatial object">Lager</span> alread...an an an experimenting <span class="spatial object">Lager</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">We...we didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="169">But, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh, <span class="populated place">Zahlappell</span> for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a group of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm. </sentence><sentence id="170">And, uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="171">The rest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="172">Just...just waiting, and...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections. </sentence><sentence id="173">Selections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going. </sentence><sentence id="174">So everybody was trying to avoid it. </sentence><sentence id="175">But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time kept telling us, "Just try to get out from here. </sentence><sentence id="176">Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the <span class="building">crematorium</span> is always working. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh, if...if you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive." </sentence><sentence id="178">So one day, when there was a selection in our <span class="dlf">block</span>, uh, I was together with a cousin of mine. </sentence><sentence id="179">We decided that, uh, "Let's...let's go for the selection." </sentence><sentence id="180">They needed five hundred girls for this selection; and, uh, I was the four hundred and ninety-ninth and she was the fifth...fifth...five hundred[th] to be selected. </sentence><sentence id="181">And there was two more girls with us--also cousins--who were cut off, and they remained in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">They never came back alive. </sentence><sentence id="183">We were...we were, uh, really lucky ones. </sentence><sentence id="184">We were sent to, uh, a <span class="building">factory</span> to work in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh, I believe the <span class="building">factory</span> belonged to <span class="populated place">Messerschmitt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">That's what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="187">It was, uh, situated on <span class="dlf">Ulmerstrasse</span> in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>; and it was not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in the regular sense, becau...we were locked up. </sentence><sentence id="188">I mean, we were not allowed to leave the <span class="building">buildings</span>;
