[ </sentence><sentence id="103">remember him asking my mother how old she was  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and she said, "<span class="populated place">Vierzig</span>" [<span class="country">GER</span>: forty] That's all she was. </sentence><sentence id="104">And he sent her to the other side.(Crying) But at that point we thought we going to see each other yet. </sentence><sentence id="105">I mean we had no idea of, of, uh, what was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="106">And then they told us that you're going to see them later, that you're going to see them at night. </sentence><sentence id="107">They're taking the young people to work and, uh, at night or or on the weekend you're going to be together. </sentence><sentence id="108">Uh, first they asked for the twins, if we had any twins between us. </sentence><sentence id="109">I remember some who were twins and they took them out and then they were asking for other occupations, uh, to step aside. </sentence><sentence id="110">They wanted. </sentence><sentence id="111">The rest of us were marched to the <span class="interior space">bath</span>, to, to take a <span class="interior space">shower</span>, to a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">We had to take all our clothes off and put them nicely in a pile when we come out to find them, and they brought us into this huge <span class="interior space">room</span> where the <span class="interior space">showers</span> were overhead and they locked the <span class="dlf">doors</span> on us and, uh, and, uh, hot steaming water came out. </sentence><sentence id="113">Little did we know that our parents got the same <span class="interior space">showers</span> with the gas on. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, when we came out from the <span class="spatial object">showers</span> we came out on the other <span class="dlf">door</span> so we never got our clothes back, our shoes or anything. </sentence><sentence id="115">Even the last pin from my hair was taken out and, uh, we got a a dress, a grey cotton dress. </sentence><sentence id="116">No underwear. </sentence><sentence id="117">I got a pair of shoes which was three sizes too big on my feet, wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="118">And we were marched into a <span class="building">barrack</span> where there were these, uh, so-called <span class="spatial object">bleachers</span> (ph) what we were sleeping, uh, lay ourself, uh, <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">Twelve of us on one, so if one turned around, all twelve had to turn. </sentence><sentence id="120">Uh, one bow! </sentence><sentence id="121">of, uh, soup without a spoon or cup or anything for the twelve of us, so each took one sip and and handed to the others. </sentence><sentence id="122">And, uh, these, uh, Jewish girls, uh, were Czechoslovak, from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, were our Blockiltesters. </sentence><sentence id="123">They were the overseers. </sentence><sentence id="124">And they were telling us, tried to orient us of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> routine, what, how, what was waiting for us and they told us that, uh, you'll never see your parents again. </sentence><sentence id="125">You might as well forget about it because they are already in the, marched into the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">We just couldn't believe them you know in our wildest dream that that something like this could happen. </sentence><sentence id="127">We thought they were just, uh, being tude to us. </sentence><sentence id="128">They they wanted to punish us for, for not being here the same way like they were for so many years already. </sentence><sentence id="129">And, uh, we just shrugged it off. </sentence><sentence id="130">We we, but in the meantime they told us if there will be a selection, just volunteer, volunteer for anything. </sentence><sentence id="131">Go out of here. </sentence><sentence id="132">This is a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, and, and, uh, the farther you get away from it the better it is. </sentence><sentence id="133">So happens after three days we were shipped, uh, the, the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were coming in day and night from <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">Actually I was in the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to leave <span class="country">Hungary</span> to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and, uh, day and night they were bringing in people and even the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> couldn't work fast enough for it, so they had to make <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">We had to make <span class="interior space">room</span> for the newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="136">We were sent to, uh, <span class="populated place">Cracow</span>, <span class="populated place">P_aszow</span> the <span class="dlf">Lager</span> was called. </sentence><sentence id="137">It was the most horrible place on earth. </sentence><sentence id="138">I think it was worse than <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, even though it had no <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">But we worked very, very hard there. </sentence><sentence id="140">Four o'clock in the morning we had to get up to for Zahlappells, uh, counting of the rolls, and stay there for hours under the <span class="env feature">stars</span> in our one piece of clothes and it was freezing cold. </sentence><sentence id="141">This was in May,  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection but it was in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, and we had no clothes on and we had no food and and everybody was cold. </sentence><sentence id="142">And, uh, staying there after after the Zahlappell we were marched out to work. </sentence><sentence id="143">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> was situated on a, on a <span class="env feature">mountainside</span> and our work was to carry these big wooden planks up on the steep <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, that we we stood like three girls or five girls on there, one of these big wooden plank and carried it on our shoulders up on the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">And, uh, German...of course like I said everything had to be done "schnell" and, uh, and, uh, they were coming with the German Shepherds to chase us to go fast. </sentence><sentence id="145">Now when you have a three size too big pair of <span class="spatial object">shoes</span> on your feet and the mud, and it's muddy and and go up on the <span class="env feature">mountainside</span>, it's, it's terribly hard, and we were doing this work all day long. </sentence><sentence id="146">And by the time we came back <span class="building">home</span> on the other side of the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, uh, sometimes the food ran out already. </sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, the last people didn't get any or or else we got some soup with, uh, some barley, barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="148">That was our mainstay for three months, every single day. </sentence><sentence id="149">Barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="150">And, uh, lot of, uh, after a while we were issued some clothes because it was, like I said it was very cold there in them. </sentence><sentence id="151">We had some sweaters and, and coats and by the time we realized it, it was full of lice, this clothes. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, so whenever we could escape a little, hide from the work, our pastime was to kill the lice, the, the; it was, uh, we suffered a lot there from, from, uh, from the other people. </sentence><sentence id="153">From the other camp-mates who were, who were not, uh, not good to us because they felt that we were, uh, spoiled or, or we just coming from, from our, our, uh, <span class="building">homes</span> and they were already suffering for years and years and they thought we're not even Jewish, Jewish, uh, prisoners because you don't speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="154">We don't belong. </sentence><sentence id="155">But nevertheless, uh, we settled down sort of a routine until until the partisans began to really raid on the, make a lot of raids around the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and, and the front was coming closer I suppose, so, so one day we were evacuated from there. </sentence><sentence id="156">And we were sent, we were sent back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">Of course we didn't know we're going there and this is, uh, uh, maybe a three-hour trip <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> betwe...between <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="populated place">Cracow</span>, the distance should be three hours. </sentence><sentence id="158">It took us three days to get back in the hottest summer, August Sth I remember. </sentence><sentence id="159">Hundred and thirty us of us in one <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">It was so hot that I remember one night I, I must have dozed off and I, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped so I woke up and it was raining and water was coming down on my head. </sentence><sentence id="161">I thought to myself I must be losing my mind because I know that we started out with a <span class="spatial object">covered wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">How can it be raining? </sentence><sentence id="163">Until I found out that the humidity in the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> was so high that it was coming down in drops from the <span class="interior space">ceiling</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">We had absolutely no <span class="env feature">water</span>, no food, no <span class="env feature">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">After three days when we finally arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="dlf">wagon doors</span>, we give thank God, thanks to God that we are in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we're perhaps going to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, and this will be the end of our journey. ( </sentence><sentence id="166">Pause) Uh, but we didn't go to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">We went back to another lag...uh, <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">I think it was the <span class="populated place">C Lager</span> they called it. </sentence><sentence id="169">And, uh, our, we were full of lice I told you, so our hair  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was shaved. </sentence><sentence id="170">Before they didn't have time because usually when a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> arrives, the women are all shaved. </sentence><sentence id="171">Their hair is shaved off but when I first came there, it did...it didn't, they were such, in such a rush that they didn't, they didn't do it to us but when we fir...came back to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, they shaved our heads which was good because we were full of lice, like Itold you. </sentence><sentence id="172">And, uh, they tattooed me. </sentence><sentence id="173">This was just another...we really didn't care at that point. </sentence><sentence id="174">We didn't think that that we, we, we really ex...ceased to be human beings. </sentence><sentence id="175">We were just a number already but who care...mean it was beyond us already. </sentence><sentence id="176">And, uh, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="177">It was just a transport <span class="spatial object">Lager</span> alread...an an an experimenting <span class="spatial object">Lager</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">We...we didn't have to work. </sentence><sentence id="179">But, of course, the food was very, uh, skimpy and, uh, and also we had to stay in li...in, uh, <span class="populated place">Zahlappell</span> for hours long in the cold nights, so much so that I remember we used to, a group of us used to huddle together and keep each other warm. </sentence><sentence id="180">And, uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="181">The rest of our times just, uh, went by, uh, without doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="182">Just...just waiting, and...and... and...and uh (pause) they kept saying, uh, there were constantly selections. </sentence><sentence id="183">Selections from us, but we didn't, uh, know where the selections were going. </sentence><sentence id="184">So everybody was trying to avoid it. </sentence><sentence id="185">But nevertheless these, uh, inmates who were there a longer time kept telling us, "Just try to get out from here. </sentence><sentence id="186">Because it's, uh...here it's, uh, the <span class="building">crematorium</span> is always working. </sentence><sentence id="187">Uh, if...if you go away, maybe you'll be lucky and, uh, survive." </sentence><sentence id="188">So one day, when there was a selection in our <span class="dlf">block</span>, uh, I was together with a cousin of mine. </sentence><sentence id="189">We decided that, uh, "Let's...let's go for the selection." </sentence><sentence id="190">They needed five hundred girls for this selection; and, uh, I was the four hundred and ninety-ninth and she was the fifth...fifth...five hundred[th] to be selected. </sentence><sentence id="191">And there was two more girls with us--also cousins--who were cut off, and they remained in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">They never came back alive. </sentence><sentence id="193">We were...we were, uh, really lucky ones. </sentence><sentence id="194">We were sent to, uh, a <span class="building">factory</span> to work in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh, I believe the <span class="building">factory</span> belonged to <span class="populated place">Messerschmitt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">That's what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was, uh, situated on <span class="dlf">Ulmerstrasse</span> in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>; and it was not a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in the regular sense, becau...we were locked up. </sentence><sentence id="198">I mean, we were not allowed to leave the <span class="building">buildings</span>; but, uh, we were living in the <span class="building">factory building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">It was a huge L-shaped <span class="building">building</span> and we were living in one on one side of it with the Ger...with our German guards and, uh, we were working in the other side of the <span class="building">building</span>, so we never left the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">We went through the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, up to the other <span class="region">side</span> to work and, uh, our food was a little better than if we were not working. </sentence><sentence id="201">And our guards were not hitting us like they were in <span class="populated place">Cracow</span> with the, with the leather--uh, I don't know what you call them--and there were plenty of beatings there and and so we were, uh, handled more humanely. </sentence><sentence id="202">Nevertheless, uh, we were hungry constantly but, uh, there was five hundred of us. </sentence><sentence id="203">Five hundred Hungarian girls and, uh, we were working hard for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="204">The German civilians worked in the same place but not together with us. </sentence><sentence id="205">Separate, separate departments. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh, had a lot of air raids in those days in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">The Americans came constantly. </sentence><sentence id="208">Every night we could set  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection our clock by it that what time the air raid is going to be and we were happy about it. </sentence><sentence id="209">We were glad. </sentence><sentence id="210">We were wishing they would bomb the place down and, uh, with us together (laughter) whatever but, uh, the Germans didn't--we had to go to the <span class="building">air shelters</span> every night because the Germans wouldn't leave us up there. </sentence><sentence id="211">They were afraid we, we might signal the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">One day there was a bomb fell on our <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> and it never exploded. </sentence><sentence id="213">The German workers said that it's because the Jews are here. </sentence><sentence id="214">They, they already felt that they lost the war. </sentence><sentence id="215">Actually the Germans felt it. </sentence><sentence id="216">They knew it. </sentence><sentence id="217">But of course everybody was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="218">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="219">We were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="220">They wouldn't talk to us, uh, but, uh, they they they knew that, uh, it's getting out of hand. </sentence><sentence id="221">Don't forget this was toward the end of the war and, uh, we tried we tried to do our work so we should sabotage a few of their <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> but I don't know if it succeeded or not (laughter) but uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Well we were we were I was working in the they called it where our job was to, to these <span class="region">parts</span> we were dipping into these chemicals so they shouldn't oxidize because when they put them in the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> they're, you know, rusty, they're not treated, uh, good enough so we tried to manipulate a little that it shouldn't be so good but I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="364">It was just a hope that maybe we did some good. </sentence><sentence id="365">And, uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="366">Our, uh, German the, the Hauptscharfihrer (ph) who was, uh, the after a while he became very mean and we, we heard rumors that his son was killed at the <span
