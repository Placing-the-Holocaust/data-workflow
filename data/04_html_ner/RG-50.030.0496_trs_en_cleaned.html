<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: But it's -- it's certainly true that I am able to at least comment about what I think are later deductions as opposed to early memories, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="64">Be glad to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family, your -- let's talk first about your father, who has one of those longest names that I've ever heard in my life. </sentence><sentence id="68">Can you give us his full name? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Where do all these names come from, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I don't know because my paternal grandparents had already died when I was old enough to remember anything as a toddler. </sentence><sentence id="86">So I have no idea where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="87">It may also have been This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="88">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="89"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the fashion at the time to give people more than -- although that's not really true because my uncle who was born in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, only had one name. </sentence><sentence id="90">So maybe it had to do with Sephardic as opposed to Ashkenazic Jews. </sentence><sentence id="91">Maybe it had to do with <span class="country">Holland</span> versus <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">Maybe it had to do with whatever the background of my father's parents was, which I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="93">I don't know what their occupation was or anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Do you remember if he was called Jacque? </sentence><sentence id="106">Was he known by his first name, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: He was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: And what did he do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in American parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague meaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one of these European bakers who did all these specialty desserts. </sentence><sentence id="115">And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a baker on the <span class="dlf">Holland-America line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And apparently before he was married, he -- that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="117">And at some point, I don't exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he wasn't going to do this any more. </sentence><sentence id="118">And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once more, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one more trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I'm not doing it any more. </sentence><sentence id="119">And the -- that voyage, that <span class="spatial object">ship</span> that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left over from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no, he wasn't going to do this any more. </sentence><sentence id="120">But that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="121">And he had a <span class="building">bakery</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, but I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: So when you were born, did he have the <span class="building">bakery</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="132"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: I think he still owned the <span class="building">bakery</span>, but he didn't work at it. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I -- I know that he left the <span class="building">house</span> every day, but I'm not really sure where he went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: And the only baking that I was familiar with was what he did on Sunday mornings. </sentence><sentence id="142">It was traditional that he baked a pound cake. </sentence><sentence id="143">And so the <span class="building">house</span> was always filled with this wonderful smell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: [have spent my life trying to find one like it, but it is impossible, it seems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Is that one of your earliest memories -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: -- of your father, is -- is baking at -- the pound cake? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early memory is probably one of -- of him playing games with me. </sentence><sentence id="156">Being left at the dinner or <span class="spatial object">breakfast table</span> with my father is an early memory, because I didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they used to say I lived off the <span class="dlf">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I just was not a child who ate a lot, and I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="159">And he would pull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a spoonful of something or other in my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="160">And that -- that's sort of my earliest recollection, it -- it's one of the very early ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Huh. </sentence><sentence id="168">You took walks with your father also. </sentence><sentence id="169">Was -- was that after the occupation, or do you remember [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: I very much remember it before also. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="173"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="175"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: It was sort of our special time of day together, and he would come <span class="building">home</span> from -- as I say from wherever, I don't know from where. </sentence><sentence id="177">And -- and then he and I would go for a walk just the two of us, and we would walk in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, around the <span class="dlf">block</span> or whatever, and it -- it was both before the occupation and for a short time after. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Did he also walk with your sister, or was this very special for you? </sentence><sentence id="181">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Ifhe walked with my sister I don't know about it, but he may have been one of these wonderful parents who knew how to make each child feel very special and -- and he probably did something with her, or maybe a walk or something else with her. </sentence><sentence id="185">I-I don't know, I actually never asked her. </sentence><sentence id="186">But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don't remember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early evening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: And you'd have conversations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: And would you tell -- would he ask you what your day was like, was that the -- or was it different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: I don't think he asked me what my day was like. </sentence><sentence id="197">My sort of recollection, and as I say here, I'm not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child's level about something very present. </sentence><sentence id="198">There wasn't stuff about what did you do, or what are you going to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the present that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Was his way of behaving with you, it -- as -- from what you can remember, different from other fathers? </sentence><sentence id="203">It doesn't sound like the usual story of a father being so concerned about the kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="206"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="207">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="208"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: | -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and certainly not a child's memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like. </sentence><sentence id="210">But I would say yes. </sentence><sentence id="211">I would say for several reasons. </sentence><sentence id="212">Number one, he was an extremely gentle and patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and ever and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the treasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors. </sentence><sentence id="213">And one time he and I were sitting in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> of our <span class="building">house</span>, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark <span class="spatial object">oak furniture</span>, sort of dark, dark -- you know that heavy <span class="spatial object">European furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">And over the big, big <span class="spatial object">table</span> in the middle of this <span class="interior space">living room</span> -- w-why this <span class="interior space">living room</span> had this great big <span class="spatial object">table</span> sort of like -- more like a <span class="spatial object">dining room table</span>, I don't know, but that's the way it was set up. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the <span class="spatial object">table</span> had these heavy crosspieces underneath. </sentence><sentence id="216">And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it's more the kind of thing you can imagine over a <span class="spatial object">piano</span>, but it was over the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and it had long fringes on it, and it was over the <span class="spatial object">table</span> in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="217">And it was great place for me, I always had my little hideout there, it was a little -- like a little <span class="building">house</span>, and I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the <span class="spatial object">tablecloth</span> a haircut. </sentence><sentence id="218">Not fun at the time. </sentence><sentence id="219">But was he different? </sentence><sentence id="220">I think he was also different because I think my mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don't think she called herself that at the time. </sentence><sentence id="221">She was the working partner in the hou -- in the <span class="building">home</span> at the time that I remember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in some kind of financial activity. </sentence><sentence id="222">Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and - - so she was out of my <span class="interior space">circle</span> for much of the day. </sentence><sentence id="223">She was also not the one who was either as patient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being. </sentence><sentence id="224">Not that my father was necessarily fun This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="225">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="226"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection loving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what I remember from my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="248">So she was the disciplinarian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Probably, although from my point of view it wasn't -- you know, it was never fair, and it was never -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="253">So who took care of you during the day then, if you -- both of your parents are out -- you don't know what your father's doing, but your mother's certainly working. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="255">Well, it wasn't unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days. </sentence><sentence id="256">I mean, this is now the 30's we're talking. </sentence><sentence id="257">And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl, who -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served, when I was still in my <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, and the breakfast consisted of these things called <span class="populated place">Dutch rusk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">I don't know if you know what those are, but it's sort of a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick. </sentence><sentence id="259">And she always had them drenched in honey. </sentence><sentence id="260">And so she would bring me these things in the <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, and the honey would be all over the place, and I hated it. </sentence><sentence id="261">I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and drippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, and the honey. </sentence><sentence id="262">So yes, I think she was probably one that took care of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: So how old do you think you were when you were in the <span class="spatial object">crib</span>? </sentence><sentence id="273">Two, three? </sentence><sentence id="274">Ye -- ye -- I mean, that's a clear memory for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: It's a very clear memory, and since it was a <span class="spatial object">crib</span>, I must have been two or so. </sentence><sentence id="279">Couldn't -- couldn't leave that sticky memory behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: And your sist -- tell me what your mother -- what -- what was your mother's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz. </sentence><sentence id="285">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="286">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="287"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: And was there difference in your parent's age, do you know? </sentence><sentence id="293">Or were they pretty close together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I-I'm not really sure. </sentence><sentence id="297">It's possible that my mother was maybe a year older or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Or maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="303">I-I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="304">I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very late parent -- mother. </sentence><sentence id="305">I mean, there are eight years difference between my sister and me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: And I think that she married rather late, as well, so I'm -- yeah, I'm -- I'm sort of guessing that she was in her 40's when I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="315">Hm. </sentence><sentence id="316">Was pretty late then. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: And your sister Betsy was eight years older than you. </sentence><sentence id="323">And do you have a recollection as a kid, of this older sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>

-- when I was 45 or something. </sentence><sentence id="4499">You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and this is what was happening, and what would I do, and so

normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as possible. </sentence><sentence id="4501">And so I -- I know I'm veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand that they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view. </sentence><sentence id="4502">So we did very little by way of Jewish tradition in the <span

communicated. </sentence><sentence id="4503">So we didn't really want our kids exposed to that, so ours was by contrast a much more inclusive <span class="building">home</span>, and there was -- it wa -- it's really interesting because l-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that <span class="populated place">community</span>, or this group of people is -- is really the

that. </sentence><sentence id="4512">Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that's probably not that unusual, I imagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it's not always the happy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids had a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for
