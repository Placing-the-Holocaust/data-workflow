<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: So, did you think that your mother and her mother-in-law spoke about -- that her mother- in-law told your mother about what her son was doing? </sentence><sentence id="209">So she -- so your mother knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="212">Or do you think not? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="214">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="215"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: I don't think... It's interesting, when -- much later, when I went into her papers, when she died and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still kept. </sentence><sentence id="217">I don't think his name was ever mentioned in the <span class="building">house</span> of his parents because they felt so shameful, but they certainly took over. </sentence><sentence id="218">They had a <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="region">Brittany</span>, and they spent three months of the year. </sentence><sentence id="219">The whole summer they spent in <span class="region">Brittany</span> with the grandparents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Oh, very much and intellectually. </sentence><sentence id="231">He -- my grandfather was for his job but extremely intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="232">He made his money by making up, what you would call, the <span class="building">New York Times</span> crossword puzzle. </sentence><sentence id="233">And then once a year, he would go -- he never went out; they were very sedentary. </sentence><sentence id="234">But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a competition and that made the money for the rest of the year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles. </sentence><sentence id="243">Either winning the competition -- that was a yearly thing -- or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be <span class="building">Le Monde</span>, that was a great newspaper of the day. </sentence><sentence id="244">And that meant that he was encyclopedique. </sentence><sentence id="245">When he died, there was a fight over who would get his <span class="spatial object">dictionary</span>, because the <span class="spatial object">dictionaries</span> were annotated and it counted a lot. </sentence><sentence id="246">He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French. </sentence><sentence id="247">He had groups of our little friends come every... once a week to study with him and he was great. </sentence><sentence id="248">I mean, they were just great. </sentence><sentence id="249">And it was very, very modest life. </sentence><sentence id="250">They did not have any hot water. </sentence><sentence id="251">They did not have any running water except in one <span class="spatial object">faucet</span> in the whole <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">So you can read those <span class="spatial object">breaux</span> (ph) that you see now, people collect them. </sentence><sentence id="253">But for us it was a necessity of life. </sentence><sentence id="254">You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big <span class="spatial object">bowls</span> and you wash like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: So the difference between your mother's family... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: And the other family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: And the other family was very different financially. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean, really, if you call that lonely, that part was the silence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2428">Q: And it's quite possible that people that you knew, with whom you were friends, were also doing it, but nobody was talking, because you weren't supposed to. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: Nicole I, I don't want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942, because I'm not sure anybody's memory can be clear about when things happened. </sentence><sentence id="2660">But do you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you moved out from your mother, or was it... do you think it was later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2663">A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2664">Because I used not to come back to the <span class="building">house</span>, as I told you, not to come back to that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, not to involve her, not to have her know about my activities. </sentence><sentence id="2665">And so... And also for the date, I know that what really shook me was that Vel d'Hiv... when the word came out, and it came out, not that I saw the inside of the place, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so close to were everybody lived. </sentence><sentence id="2666">And at that point, I thought I had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2667">But I just sort of had to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2673">Q: More than what you were doing? " </sentence><sentence id="2674">Cause you obviously were doing something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2677">A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2679">Q: Then that bothered you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2681">A: ... which was late, then I had to step in and do something. </sentence><sentence id="2682">Because I was in a unique position to probably be able to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2685">Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that they were going to take children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2687">A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had -- thanks again to the organization of the German -- an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raids. </sentence><sentence id="2688">And that's the way I knew where to go to get the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2691">Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew? </sentence><sentence id="2692">Were they in some sense assisting with the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2695">A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="2696">It probably was. </sentence><sentence id="2697">There was a point there where it was unhealthy. </sentence><sentence id="2698">But for my sake, it was practical. </sentence><sentence id="2699">I think after the war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they maybe shouldn't have had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2705">Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2707">A: I guess that's the way I got it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2719">Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going to do something? </sentence><sentence id="2720">I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2727">Q: But you don't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2729">A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="2730">You do it and then that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2731">I thought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never thought of it. </sentence><sentence id="2732">Definitely normal behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2733">What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="2734">Sit back and let it be. </sentence><sentence id="2735">So, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the type of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2736">And I was in an unusual position that I could do something. </sentence><sentence id="2737">Because of the way the French government was going to protect me, one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2747">Q: So you felt... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2749">A: Compelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2751">Q: [Coughs] I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2752">You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the French government would protect you, which didn't mean that you were totally protected because the Germans might do something, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2755">A: Well... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2757">Q: There was some danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2759"> A That came, that came -- for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that moment on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the <span class="dlf">compartment door</span>, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or whoever it was that I was transporting -- and it was a kid capable of talking -- had given out anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead -- I was just as good as dead at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2760">So, when I went into it, I didn't know the extent of the danger and most of the time, probably, I wasn't discovered, so there was no danger. </sentence><sentence id="2761">It worked well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2765">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2766">But now you're doing this in connection with the underground group that you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2769">A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2781">Q: All of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2783">A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2784">Because otherwise I would not know where they were to be had, to start with, <span class="populated place">Paris</span> being a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2787">Q: So this was a <span class="interior space">Jewish underground</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2797">Q: The <span class="dlf">U.G.LF.</span>, </sentence><sentence id="2798">yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the Germans... You were not doing this openly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2801">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2803">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2805">A: And the only people that would have any inkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was the Jewish organization in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2807">Q: So your mother -- You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people you were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at once? </sentence><sentence id="2809">Or they were taking a few at a time that they...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2813">A: They came, they came individually. </sentence><sentence id="2814">They would come to your <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and ring, and if the bell rang at four o'clock in the morning, you knew who it was. </sentence><sentence id="2815">And what happened is that after the <span class="spatial object">Vel d'Hiv</span> -- this is when the <span class="spatial object">Vel d'Hiv</span> come in -- they would not anymore -- I didn't see it in the book -- but they would not anymore tackle young children. </sentence><sentence id="2816">So, the Germans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands. </sentence><sentence id="2817">Because it created such an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point the whole <span class="populated place">city</span> would rebel against them. </sentence><sentence id="2818">So, in some ways, I was in the <span class="region">middle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2819">It was a sort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things. </sentence><sentence id="2820">It was some very shady participation there. </sentence><sentence id="2821">"Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that happened at the very specific date.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2868">A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal experience, do not give away their children. </sentence><sentence id="2869">So I had some persuading to do to them, which was the difficult part. </sentence><sentence id="2870">It was in two parts: first, "This is it, you are doomed". </sentence></p></dialogue>
