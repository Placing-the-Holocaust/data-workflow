<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Simon Federman. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, on March 1, 1926.Q. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war. </sentence><sentence id="5">A. Before the war, my parents originally came from <span class="country">Poland</span>, in the beginning of the 1920s. </sentence><sentence id="6">My father was a watchmaker, jeweler. </sentence><sentence id="7">We had a very modest life because he never made a lot of money, but it was a quiet simple life. </sentence><sentence id="8">I had three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="9">One of them passed away. </sentence><sentence id="10">We were not religious people, maybe the reason was it wasn't very easy in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in those years to buy kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="11">It would have been an effort. </sentence><sentence id="12">My mother stopped after a little while to go to a small <span class="region">Jewish section</span> of <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to buy kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="13">So, we started to live like everybody in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> without being kosher, and our religion was not very, very important in our <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">During the 1930s, even I being a young boy, listening to the <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, reading some newspapers, hearing my parents when they were talking, we heard what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">You know, we were religious, but we still were very Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="16">I knew personally some of the tradition. </sentence><sentence id="17">I knew some of the holidays, but I never went to <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">But this being Jewish I knew it and I felt it; 1 was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="19">What was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> touched us. </sentence><sentence id="20">In the later 30s I started to see some people coming from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and they were Jews who were running away. </sentence><sentence id="21">I was hearing some of the hardship they had in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">But it didn't you know it was something I heard, but I didn't feel it. </sentence><sentence id="23">I was too young, but I knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="24">In 1939, just before the war, I was listening to the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> like most of the people and we heard that there might be a war against <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25"><span class="country">Germany</span> attacked <span class="country">Poland</span>, there might be a war, but we didn't have to worry about it because we were so strong. </sentence><sentence id="26"><span class="country">France</span> was so strong, that if <span class="country">Germany</span> ever they are doing anything, we would run over them in a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="27">And all this was lies. </sentence><sentence id="28">But we believed it. </sentence><sentence id="29">Every single day we heard that propaganda And the poor folks everything was a lie, because it took the German army to conquer <span class="country">France</span> in a couple weeks. </sentence><sentence id="30">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="31">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="32"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Q. In <span class="populated place">Paris</span> you went to a public school?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="33">Q. And were you friends very mixed?A. Mixed?Q. Catholic, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="34">A. Mixed, that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies, we didn't have any black people, because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">So, when we talk about mix, it was religion. </sentence><sentence id="36">But like I say, I didn't feel any different between the Christian and me. </sentence><sentence id="37">Enough of this, I have the feeling it never went to their mind that I was different than they were. </sentence><sentence id="38">Because we were a small minority, and as long as they knew that I was born in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">I spoke like them. </sentence><sentence id="40">I didn't have any accent, so I must have been in their mind, I'm sure, they must have thought I was like them, a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="41">Even when I was in the Army, it never went to their mind that I could have been different. </sentence><sentence id="42">That's how religion was. </sentence><sentence id="43">My mannerism and everything was <span class="populated place">Parisian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">Q. You never were aware of anti-semitism as a boy?A. I knew it existed because I knew how you know sometime when people were arguing or fighting they said to somebody else, you know, he's a dirty Jew. </sentence><sentence id="45">But I don't know, but it never was addressed to me, because I don't want to sound macho, but I wouldn't have tolerated it. </sentence><sentence id="46">So, they did nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="47">I already didn't feel anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="48">I didn't feel anything like that when I was a young kid in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">I was like anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="50">Q. What do you remember about the <span class="country">Germany</span> occupation, the first days?A. What I remember is I really saw the Germans in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't see them in 1939, because when the war started my father was called into the army and like the result of all that propaganda and all this they mobilized a million people, but they were not ready for it. </sentence><sentence id="52">My father had half of a uniform, no guns, sleeping in the <span class="spatial object">subway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">You know, this was supposed to be the 12 median French army. </sentence><sentence id="54">So, the commander decided, and I think in the end of 1939, tried to evacuate women and children from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">Not because we didn't know you know the Germans were going This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="56">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="57"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to bomb <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, whatever, so they decided -- and also I remember in <span class="building">school</span> they gave us some gas masks, that you were supposed to carry at all times with our gas masks in it. </sentence><sentence id="58">Like I was saying before, they decided to evacuate women and children and we were to register, the women and children, and they send us out I think about 100 miles from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, in small little <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">And this is where my mother, my sister and myself went. </sentence><sentence id="60">It lasted a few months, until the Germans really had their offensive. </sentence><sentence id="61">One day the offensive, they had a big offensive all of a sudden they are finally I think they realized they had so many men in the army, but they didn't have anything to give them. </sentence><sentence id="62">So, what they did, they released my father who had four children. </sentence><sentence id="63">When my father was released, the first thing he did was go into the <span class="populated place">village</span> where we were. </sentence><sentence id="64">When he got there, he heard on the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> where the German army is advancing and the French government did something also not very smart. </sentence><sentence id="65">They made a call over the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> that all men 13 years old must try to move to to reform and fight the Germans there. </sentence><sentence id="66">I never saw a gun in my life. </sentence><sentence id="67">I'm 13 and they're going to make me fight there. </sentence><sentence id="68">But, we decided the Germans are not going to catch us. </sentence><sentence id="69">We didn't have any <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">We didn't have anything, we started to work, and we found some <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> going by or whatever and we got a <span class="spatial object">lift</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">We got to a <span class="building">train station</span> and then we tried to get on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we finally got to .Q. When was this?A. 1940.Q. In June?A. I think it was the early part of 1940, maybe in June. </sentence><sentence id="72">May, June, I don't remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="73">It wasn't very cold. </sentence><sentence id="74">Q. But you hadn't yet seen Germans coming in?A. I didn't see them. </sentence><sentence id="75">We knew while we were on the <span class="dlf">road</span> going to we saw  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection like this and talking to them, some of them were Jewish, and they said we are going over to <span class="populated place">Purinae</span>, over to <span class="country">Spain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">If you have anybody in the <span class="country">United States</span>, try to reach <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">The <span class="building">American consulate</span> will try to get you some papers to reach <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">So, my father had a brother there in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">So, we said, Okay, let's try it. </sentence><sentence id="80">When we got to the <span class="dlf">border</span> we were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="81">We said okay, we are going to go in <span class="country">Spain</span> but what's going to end up with my mother and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="82">I cannot abandon them. </sentence><sentence id="83">So, we decided to go back. </sentence><sentence id="84">We couldn't leave my mother. </sentence><sentence id="85">So, we decided to go back because we could not abandon my mother and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then <span class="country">France</span> was divided. </sentence><sentence id="87">Already the German army stopped in the middle of <span class="country">France</span> with an armistice and the <span class="region">northern part</span>, the Germans were there, and the <span class="region">southern part</span> was the Vichy government. </sentence><sentence id="88">So, I don't remember exactly the date, but we got on board a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and got back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">In the meantime, my mother and sisters were back into <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and when I got to the <span class="dlf">border</span> between <span class="region">South France</span>, <span class="region">northern part</span>, this is when I saw the Germans for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="90">They went to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but it wasn't that important because he had so many people trying to get back to their <span class="building">home</span>, so they didn't look at us too close. </sentence><sentence id="91">We got into <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">Q. Was it frightening to see the German presence?A. No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="93">It was orders and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="94">Q. Was it fairly easy to go back and forth between <span class="populated place">Vichy</span> and --?A. It was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="95">It was not easy because after that you need a visa, which we are talking a few days after the armistice was signed. </sentence><sentence id="96">So, I really don't think they were organized to really put a lot of control, you know, between the <span class="region">north</span> and the <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, we got into <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and then life went back more or less normal. </sentence><sentence id="98">You saw Germans in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">All of a sudden a few months later, I think it was the beginning of 1941, all of a sudden we were told if we were a Jew, we had to register. </sentence><sentence id="100">We had to go to what we called <span class="building">police</span>, you know the man in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Jewish star, the Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="101">They told us you must put it on your clothes. </sentence><sentence id="102">And also, certain restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="103">If we took the <span class="spatial object">subway</span>, we were to go only in the last <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">We were not allowed to go to <span class="building">public places</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">So, my mother sewed my clothes, the Jewish star. </sentence><sentence id="106">The next day, I told my mother, take it off, please. </sentence><sentence id="107">She said, no why? </sentence><sentence id="108">I said, nothing doing. </sentence><sentence id="109">I said if they are going to decide to pick me up, I'm not going to make it easy for them. </sentence><sentence id="110">You know, I don't look exactly like what the Germans think a Jew looks like, you know with the big nose and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="111">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="112">After arguing for a little while, she took it off. </sentence><sentence id="113">I could not accept those restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="114">I wanted to be able to go into a <span class="dlf">park</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">I want to get into a move. </sentence><sentence id="116">I was young. </sentence><sentence id="117">The danger was not that great. </sentence><sentence id="118">And after that, we noticed something else. </sentence><sentence id="119">They were starting to pick up Jews, but they were picking up mostly foreign Jews. </sentence><sentence id="120">We noticed what they were doing, they knew people were coming back from work at 6:00 at night, so they were closing off <span class="dlf">streets</span> not far from the main <span class="building">subway stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">So, I worked out with my father. </sentence><sentence id="122">I said I'll go at the time he was supposed to come back <span class="building">home</span>, and I will walk in front of him about 1,500 hundred feet. </sentence><sentence id="123">If I saw them, closing the <span class="dlf">street</span> I being a young fellow, I could run pretty fast in those days, I was running back and I would have told him and we would have taken another way of going <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">This is what we did for a while. </sentence><sentence id="125">Q. Now, let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="126">You were born in Paris?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="127">Q. But your parents were not born --?A. My parents were born in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">Q. Would they have been vulnerable to the roundups?A. No, no, because you see lucky for us, my father and my mother thought <span class="country">Poland</span> is not for them. </sentence><sentence id="129">They were born there and they saw the anti-semitism. </sentence><sentence id="130">They saw how bad it was for the Jews in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">So, one day they decided to -- the original idea was to go to <span class="country">America</span>, but they couldn't get a visa. </sentence><sentence id="132">In <span class="country">France</span>, in the early 20s needed people to work in the <span class="dlf">mines</span> in <span class="region">northern France</span>, to work in the <span class="building">factories</span>, things like that, so they were letting foreigners come to do the work that Frenchman would not do. </sentence><sentence id="133">So, my father got a job with <span class="building">Renault</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">He had in mind, I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="135">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="136"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection can't go to <span class="country">America</span>, I'm going to stay in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">I might as well try to become a Frenchman. </sentence><sentence id="138">I have the privilege and obligation of a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="139">I don't want to be a foreigner in a <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">So, what he did, after a couple of years, he applied for citizenship and he was a Frenchman and my mother and this is what French people do. </sentence><sentence id="141">Being born would have made me a Frenchman, but still they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="142">So, you know, they were picking on the foreign Jews more or less, but we knew it was a matter of time for us. </sentence><sentence id="143">So, this was our life from about 1941 to 1942.Q. Were you in school?A. I was in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was in <span class="building">school</span> but they were looking for trouble. </sentence><sentence id="145">They give us all the time in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">I couldn't continue with certain things. </sentence><sentence id="147">They put me in another <span class="building">school</span>, some kind of what do you call, <span class="building">trade school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">They really tried to get us out all the time. </sentence><sentence id="149">This was until 1942. </sentence><sentence id="150">In the beginning of 1942, I think the end of June or the beginning of July, all of a sudden we heard it was going to be bad for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="151">We already had all those laws. </sentence><sentence id="152">We had all those restrictions, and talking to some older fellows they told me a little bit more about it. </sentence><sentence id="153">They said they know from somebody in the <span class="building">police department</span> they messed up picking up the Jews of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">I think it was the 14th of 15th of July all of a sudden I was told to warn the Jews in my <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> that I knew, they were coming to pick up the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="155">But they are going to pick up the men and the boys. </sentence><sentence id="156">This is what they are going to pick up. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, they asked me to warn anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="158">Those people must have been from the resistance, I don't know where, but they had the knowledge I didn't have, and they told me, they asked me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, I started to tell everybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="160">I chose men and boys and on the 15th it will happen. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, again you warn everybody. </sentence><sentence id="162">So, a lot of men with their sons who believed it will happen, who believed us, they tried to find a place to hide and to see what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="163">I went with my older sister, -- let me go back to something. </sentence><sentence id="164">Let me go back to something else. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was getting very bad in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in the beginning of 1942, and we knew two people that we had contact with, the Germans are really going to go after us, with the help of the French police. </sentence><sentence id="166">So some people started to organize a way of getting out of the <span class="region">occupied zone</span> into the <span class="region">free zone</span> and those people were helping people to go to the <span class="region">free zone</span> where what we called , people who were passing people on  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the other side. </sentence><sentence id="167">Some did it for money. </sentence><sentence id="168">Some did it because they wanted to help. </sentence><sentence id="169">So, when we saw what was going on, the first thing we did was try to get my father out. </sentence><sentence id="170">Because I was a young boy, we figured they are going to get the man, so we spoke to one of those 5  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection remember the name a few miles to the identification <span class="dlf">line</span>, and they got to that small little <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the next morning they started to walk. </sentence><sentence id="171">They were a couple miles from what was supposed to be the <span class="region">free zone</span>, and they were walking early in the morning and a Frenchman came by with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">He looked at them and he knew the way they looked that they were not from the <span class="region">region</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, the walk was leading right to the other side so he asked my mother if she wanted him to take the two kids on his <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and put it on the <span class="dlf">hood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">My little sister was three years old and the other one was seven, eight years old and they couldn't walk that well. </sentence><sentence id="175">So, she really didn't feel like it, but she accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="176">And she found the fellow with the two children a couple miles down the <span class="dlf">road</span> waiting for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="177">Because he wasn't going to cross over to the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">So, he said walk over a little bit over there and the next <span class="populated place">village</span> you see will be in the <span class="region">free zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, they got to a <span class="dlf">field</span> and saw the <span class="populated place">village</span> and my mother told my sisters start running and don't stop until you get over there. </sentence><sentence id="180">And this is what they did. </sentence><sentence id="181">My little sister was so small that they just cut the wheat, they cut it so they had the little <span class="dlf">stump</span> left so it was catching up her little pants, so my sister grabbed her and ran with her. </sentence><sentence id="182">All of a sudden my mother a patrol, a German patrol came by and stopped my mother and they already had two women, Frenchwomen arrested there because some Christians were also trying to get to the other side to see their family. </sentence><sentence id="183">And to go to the other <span class="region">side</span> you needed a special pass and something, so they arrested those two women, and that German soldier got my mother and said what are you doing. </sentence><sentence id="184">She's says I'm on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="185">And she said my children are running in the <span class="dlf">field</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="186">I want my children. </sentence><sentence id="187">I want to get them. </sentence><sentence id="188">So he said show me what you have in your <span class="spatial object">pocketbook</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">She opened up her pocketbook and what she had was a piece of paper from a <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and the name of the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> was . </sentence><sentence id="190">The little French she knew he could understand sick children,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A. In <span class="populated place">Paris</span> yes, but when she left she did not wear it because she knew she couldn't be Jewish to go over there. </sentence><sentence id="191">A few days later it was my turn to leave <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, what we did with my sister we packed what we could, big bundles and boarded this <span class="building">train station</span> to be shipped to <span class="region">South France</span> where my father already was. </sentence><sentence id="193">Q.
