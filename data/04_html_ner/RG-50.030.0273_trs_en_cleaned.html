<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: What -- were you -- did you see a lot of difficulties in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> or round ups, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: As a Christian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Asa Christian which was unusual because I know of other people where one spouse was Jewish and the other spouse had to suffer for it and also was reported, so that was quite unusual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Was there, kind of an inward growth of the Jewish community because you were so isolated from the rest of the <span class="populated place">city</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="170">Ina way it was, of course, you know, we moved to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> late, so we really didn't have too many friends. </sentence><sentence id="171">We had relatives in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> I had an aunt who had a beautiful <span class="building">villa</span> in a beautiful suburb of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> where I actually had spent a lot of my <span class="building">school</span> vacation when we still lived in <span class="populated place">Penslo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">And my mother had sisters in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and some of us were together mostly with family and relatives in -- in <span class="region">Jewish France</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Was -- I mean, were there ever by the Jewish community to kind of take care of -- take care of each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Yes, there were. </sentence><sentence id="180">You know, the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> set up a lot of opportunities for us Jews especially us Jewish youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="181">For instance, in 1940 I found out that the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> had established some dress making courses and I enrolled in one of these courses. </sentence><sentence id="182">Unfortunately I could not quite finish it because before the end of it I was ordered to force labor. </sentence><sentence id="183">That was in April of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="184">And the forced labor I had to do was in a large <span class="building">commercial laundry</span> on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">I had quite a lengthy <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride getting there. </sentence><sentence id="186">At that time the war in Europe was on and <span class="spatial object">British bombers</span> would come over <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> practically every night and bomb <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">So we, Jewish, forced labors worked on the four p.m. to midnight shift and we had to sort dirty laundry for the German This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="188">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="189"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection army. </sentence><sentence id="190">Well, on my way <span class="building">home</span> after midnight I was usually caught in an air raid on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and had to go to a <span class="building">shelter</span> at the Neil (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="191"><span class="building">station</span> and sometimes I didn't get <span class="building">home</span> till eight, nine o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="192">That's how long the air raid lasted. </sentence><sentence id="193">Once in a while I would just make it <span class="building">home</span> and immediately had to go into our <span class="interior space">cellar</span> which was set up as an <span class="building">air raid shelter</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

know, I'm sure they were Nazis before and aside from some of the girls that I worked with at the <span class="building">base</span> I really didn't have much contact. </sentence><sentence id="1480">As

obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distribution Committee to apply for visas to go to the <span class="country">Unites States</span> for us -- for us, mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Some fellows who regularly attended these open <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And I, even though I was not that

had my breakfast yet when I received a telegram from the Joint Distribution Committee telling me to come to the <span class="building">consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1487">So I immediately went to the <span class="building">consulate</span> and I was questioned there the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="1488">Making sure I was really the person I claimed to be. </sentence><sentence

finally believed me and it didn't take that much longer then I got my visa. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Through the generosity of President Truman who had allocated visas for this place person.
