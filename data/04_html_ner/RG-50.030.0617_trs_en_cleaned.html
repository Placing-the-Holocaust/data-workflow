<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1792">A: Unless the Army removed it, you know, but I doubt that. </sentence><sentence id="1793">But they had removed all of the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and things, I'm sure, from all the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1794">We didn't see any of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
