<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Yes, uh we were all shocked. </sentence><sentence id="68">We knew what happened and through the press and the radio...there was no television of course...we heard uh that the Jews were out to uh take over the world and uh etc. </sentence><sentence id="69">and then a decree came out from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> that uh all the Jews had to turn in their gold, silver and uh all their precious stones, etc. </sentence><sentence id="70">as uh punishment to for what uh happened to the German uh <span class="building">Embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and uh that uh liquidator, Mr.Marscheck...we called him Helm (ph) Marscheck...he called me...he asked me to call him only by his first name, Victor...and he came over to my parents and he said uh to my dad, you're going to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to buy more materials and I tell you what. </sentence><sentence id="71">I'm going with you, not because I'm afraid that you won't come back, but I'm taking all your gold watch, your gold watch, all your wife's...that meaning my mother's jewelry, her diamond ring, her...she had a re...a string of real pearls...with uh and he took it to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and he left it with my uncle and it was safe at the time. </sentence><sentence id="72">Also of course my...what I mentioned before, my bar mitzvah uh watch, and when uh...then in 1939 by mistake came a letter to me, to my <span class="building">house</span>, addressed to Hans Heimann. </sentence><sentence id="73">It said you are now eighteen years old and you have to report for military...you'll be inducted in the army, which was a mistake of course because they didn't know I was Jewish, and the German army wouldn't accept Jews, so the next day my uh parents called uh my father's distant cousin, second or third cousins, in uh <span class="country">Hungary</span> and I flew out the next day and stayed with them till uh August of uh 1939, for two months, till I joined my parents in <span class="populated place">Venice</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Let's uh go back over this period. </sentence><sentence id="83">How did your parents determine to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
