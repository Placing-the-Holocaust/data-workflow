<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: They were common people like myself....growing up together. </sentence><sentence id="821">They were people I know. </sentence><sentence id="822">They're the people I know. </sentence><sentence id="823">Like there were people from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, people from other places I never knew. </sentence><sentence id="824">We just met over there. </sentence><sentence id="825">Same like I say about those people. </sentence><sentence id="826">Some of them I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="827">And like...uh... you know, ___ I mentioned to you. </sentence><sentence id="828">I never...I never knew him. </sentence><sentence id="829">I saw him in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">So the people I knew...what kind of people they were? </sentence><sentence id="831">I'd say mostly were people...hard working people. </sentence><sentence id="832">One of them specially was a man...he was a fireman. </sentence><sentence id="833">Matter of fact, he was related to Danny Kaye because Danny Kaye come from our place, his parents. </sentence><sentence id="834">And his name was also Daniel Kamiski which was the name of...uh...Danny Kaye. </sentence><sentence id="835">He wasn't a barber. </sentence><sentence id="836">I took him in. </sentence><sentence id="837">He was a nice man. </sentence><sentence id="838">He was next to me standing. </sentence><sentence id="839">And they were looking for a <span class="building">barber</span> and I said, "Danny, how about you." </sentence><sentence id="840">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="841">What's happening?They go in. </sentence><sentence id="842">Because over there, he did that job. </sentence><sentence id="843">He wasn't in the eyes of the German which another thing I have to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="844">People working in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, there wasn't a job that you work, you gonna work tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="845">Every day they changed the people they worked there. </sentence><sentence id="846">If somebody worked in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> a week, he was an old worker. </sentence><sentence id="847">He was very old because he worked there, he survived a week. </sentence><sentence id="848">Mostly they did...they changed. </sentence><sentence id="849">Every day they killed 2, 3 hundred, 4 hundred people of the people they worked in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> and from the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> arriving, like myself they took out, they took out other people. </sentence><sentence id="850">So they were working over there the same way. </sentence><sentence id="851">And those people that I know they worked with me as a barber. </sentence><sentence id="852">The same thev did. </sentence><sentence id="853">The same thine as I did. </sentence><sentence id="854">Thev had over there sometime their sisters  3 because they have to take those things in. </sentence><sentence id="855">Now there was a question also or some did ask me, "Why did they have to cut the women's hair?" </sentence><sentence id="856">Was simple, simple answer to that. </sentence><sentence id="857">Because they needed it. </sentence><sentence id="858">What they did from that was to make <span class="spatial object">saddles</span> for the horses. </sentence><sentence id="859">Now if you cut off hair from a humanbeing, those hair it just like cutting off the feathers of a goose. </sentence><sentence id="860">If you cut the feather from a goose, when the goose is alive, that will never die. </sentence><sentence id="861">Whatever you do, you push it down, it goes up...stays up. </sentence><sentence id="862">And with human hair the same way. </sentence><sentence id="863">When you cut hair from a dead person, this hair just like the person. </sentence><sentence id="864">It's dead. </sentence><sentence id="865">But if you cut the hair from a live person, if you put in the <span class="spatial object">saddle</span>, the <span class="spatial object">saddle</span> will not push down because that was...that's why they cut their hair off. </sentence><sentence id="866">Just to be send back to German to the practice over there when they...where they make the <span class="spatial object">saddles</span> with it. </sentence><sentence id="867">Now the...while working over there...did all kind of work. </sentence><sentence id="868">At the time...let me explain the...the start of the...of the day. </sentence><sentence id="869">In the morning, 5 o'clock we had a order to

in a <span class="dlf">row</span> to receive coffee. </sentence><sentence id="873">A little bit of <span class="env feature">black water</span> and slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="874">Daytime nothing. </sentence><sentence id="875">After the work, we received some kind of soup. </sentence><sentence id="876">And it was people working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>...excuse me the expression, the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> and all the places. </sentence><sentence id="877">The hardest job and I think even harder working in the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span> cutting women's hair was when the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> came in and you had to take out people from the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="878">Crippled people, small children, which they lost their parents between like let's say they took one...the mother into one <span class="spatial

those people, the old, crippled people and the small...little small children is to the <span class="building">lazarette</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">Maybe you heard what...about the <span class="spatial object">lazarette</span>. </sentence><sentence id="881">Now <span class="building">lazarette</span> usually means a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">Now over there wasn't a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="883">Was a big, very big <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="884">And it was also with <span class="env feature">trees</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="885">You couldn't see what was going on inside. </sentence><sentence id="886">In front of it was a man in a white thing with a red cross. </sentence><sentence id="887">It's just like going into a <span class="building">hospital</span>, but going into that <span class="dlf">ditch</span>...over there was <span class="country">Ukraine</span> or German...shot in the head and into the <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="888">And that was the hardest job to do. </sentence><sentence id="889">To take people, specially to have children... children a few months old...to take them in, throw them into the <span class="dlf">ditch</span> where the...over there the fire was burning day and night at that <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="890">All the thing what we find papers...all kind of thing, we threw in that <span class="dlf">ditch</span> and that was going on as long as I was there. </sentence><sentence id="891">The fire was never off. </sentence><sentence id="892">All the time it was on. </sentence><sentence id="893">And on top of that, people and people are killed. </sentence><sentence id="894">Somebody...let's say...anytime when we couldn't go in to the <span class="spatial object">latrine</span>...to the <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>, we went to the side to do his, right away they killed. </sentence><sentence id="895">That happened to a close friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="896">His brother's a

the <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="900">And that happened all the time. </sentence><sentence id="901">Every time and all the time. </sentence><sentence id="902">Now it happened that one...one time it happened. </sentence><sentence id="903">A <span class="spatial object">transport</span> came from <span class="populated place">Ketrzyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="904"><span class="populated place">Ketrzyn</span> is a little <span class="populated place">town</span> next to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="905">Came a
