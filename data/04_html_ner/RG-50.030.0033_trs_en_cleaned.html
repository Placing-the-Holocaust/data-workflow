id="608">Whoever couldn't walk that fast, they got rid of him by killing. </sentence><sentence id="609">So we went in to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="610">It was not the general <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="611">It was the <span class="building">railroad station</span> for cattle. </sentence><sentence id="612">And over there, they pushed in people. </sentence><sentence id="613">They threw in children, one on top of the other until they're loaded. </sentence><sentence id="614">Those ones...over 60 <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="615">Myself and my wife, the kid, my mother, and the little brother, we couldn't go in. </sentence><sentence id="616">It was about 2,000 more people. </sentence><sentence id="617">They couldn't go in because they had too many people already in the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> so they decided to send in...send us back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="618">Now this was unbelievable a story. </sentence><sentence id="619">All of a sudden, people start to panic. </sentence><sentence id="620">People start to dance. </sentence><sentence id="621">Happened? </sentence><sentence id="622">They were the lucky ones. </sentence><sentence id="623">They got their amount what they need to be taking out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and the rest they will not touch anymore. </sentence><sentence id="624">The people they were together, the families were together, they were very happy because nobody was missing between them. </sentence><sentence id="625">People were taking away like brothers or sisters or parents...if somebody remained of them, there was crying going on in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="626">We were sent <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">We were sent <span class="building">home</span>, but one thing whoever could understand the situation was not finished. </sentence><sentence id="628">They didn't take away the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="629">They didn't  take away the Ukrainians, and the light was still on for day and night. </sentence><sentence id="630">So we know something is going to happen to us again. </sentence><sentence id="631">We didn't have to wait too long because on the 25th, 4 days after the first <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, the same thing was going on again. </sentence><sentence id="632">September, the 25th, 1942, which on the Jewish calendar was___, again they took us out. </sentence><sentence id="633">Now this time we didn't go straight to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to be sent off. </sentence><sentence id="634">We went to the <span class="building">market</span> which over there the German the head man from the Gestapo was the man over there by the name of Degenhof, he was the leader from them. </sentence><sentence id="635">He was the murderer of the...not only this <span class="populated place">city</span>, but more <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">And that was...when he decided who should live and who should die. </sentence><sentence id="637">With the point of the finger, he said this way, the other way. </sentence><sentence id="638">A little bit younger, not too many asking questions, "What is your trade?" </sentence><sentence id="639">Somebody had a trade like electro mechanic, which was very few people in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, or engineering, other thing, to the right. </sentence><sentence id="640">Ninety five percent of the people which they took out from the <span class="building">houses</span>, he pointed to the left which means to the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="641">But before that, it is another thing I have to mention. </sentence><sentence id="642">People were running around crazy, starting to get a paper from the Judenrat and also from the Germans that...all kind of paper: red, green, with a stamp, without a stamp and everybody tried to do the best even with money to get the right paper. </sentence><sentence id="643">But nobody know what the right paper was. </sentence><sentence id="644">Each one was happy because he's got the right paper. </sentence><sentence id="645">Coming in to that place where he decided... <span class="building">Degenhof</span> decided who's going to go right, who's going to go left, the paper was not important. </sentence><sentence id="646">It was just worthless. </sentence><sentence id="647">They took the paper, tear it up. </sentence><sentence id="648">So I was with my mother and the kid, my wife and my brother, and it was most of my family who went to the left to the <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="649">Went in to the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> where the <span class="spatial object">cattle transport</span> they had, and they took us in to the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="650">That was the last time I saw the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span> before I came back from <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="651">Now to tell you a story in that <span class="spatial object">cattle train</span>, I don't know how to start and I don't know how to end because it was like living through a whole life in that thing. </sentence><sentence id="652">First thing, people one on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="653">You couldn't stand straight. </sentence><sentence id="654">You couldn't bend. </sentence><sentence id="655">You couldn't sit down. </sentence><sentence id="656">It was just like one on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="657">They took us 6 o'clock in the morning into that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">We were over there until about finished it loaded with all of us 2 hours maybe, more than that. </sentence><sentence id="659">Then they took us around back to the main <span class="building">station</span> and over there we were waiting a time. </sentence><sentence id="660">Across the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, there was another <span class="spatial object">train</span> that passengers...Polish people, they could go. </sentence><sentence id="661">They could ride, handle anything they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="662">When we stood each other, happened I was the lucky one...I was near a little <span class="dlf">window</span>, where was with <span class="dlf">wire</span> closed around that people shouldn't be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="663">I looked through. </sentence><sentence id="664">Most of the people what they did to us, they spit on us. </sentence><sentence id="665">It happened one girl I know her. </sentence><sentence id="666">She worked for a Jewish family from my...not the <span class="building">house</span> where I lived but <span class="building">house</span> where I had my <span class="building">barber shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">When she saw me she said, "Oh, you are too here?" </sentence><sentence id="668">And in a way, she started crying. </sentence><sentence id="669">But more than 90 percent of the passengers in the other side of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, they spit on us. </sentence><sentence id="670">And so we start rolling...start rolling to went nobody knew where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="671">In the middle of the night, was already about 18 hours in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, we came to a side <span class="building">station</span> which they pointed out this was <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">Stood over there for awhile and inside that <span class="spatial object">train</span>, with God's help, it was hot like <span class="region">Hell</span> and that was almost the end of September where usually in <span class="country">Poland</span>, end of September is nice and cool. </sentence><sentence id="673">But at that time, just God helped them, not us. </sentence><sentence id="674">After about | o'clock or 2 o'clock start rolling again and we went through <span class="env feature">wilderness</span> and all kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="675">We came to a halt. </sentence><sentence id="676">I looked out and I see a <span class="spatial object">sign</span> which didn't mean nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="677">The sign was <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">Today, everybody almost knows what that word means. </sentence><sentence id="679">At that time was just a name, not a...a little bit...a tiny  little... maybe...maybe it was over there 40 families altogether, all waiting with them. </sentence><sentence id="680">Stayed looking out the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="681">More things came. </sentence><sentence id="682">From other parts of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">They went in, after about 2 hours they came out. </sentence><sentence id="684">And all the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> empty. </sentence><sentence id="685">Another <span class="spatial object">train</span> also...over 60 <span class="spatial object">trains</span> with the <span class="populated place">town</span> people, they came in. </sentence><sentence id="686">Went in, disappeared, 2 hours came back. </sentence><sentence id="687">And now was the time our <span class="spatial object">train</span> start rolling and we went in. </sentence><sentence id="688"><span class="dlf">Gate</span> opened up, rolled in to the camp of <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="689">10 men over there. </sentence><sentence id="690">We got in over there. </sentence><sentence id="691">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> didn't go in like, you know, the first goes in. </sentence><sentence id="692">The engineer takes a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, but backwards because the engineer and the people they're working in the <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, they shouldn't know what's going on over there. </sentence><sentence id="693">They were not supposed to...to see what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="694">That's why the pushed in the end of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">And we went in. </sentence><sentence id="696">Out! </sentence><sentence id="697">Started yelling, "Out." </sentence><sentence id="698">It opened up. </sentence><sentence id="699">I don't know how many dead ones was a...in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>
