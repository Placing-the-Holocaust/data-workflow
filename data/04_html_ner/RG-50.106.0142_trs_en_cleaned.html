<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: You were obviously quite young then. </sentence><sentence id="105">Did it mean anything to you to see these Nazi parades with these flags and uniforms? </sentence><sentence id="106">Or what did it mean to you as a young -- very young child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the Nazis were doing. </sentence><sentence id="111">Our parents did not keep any secrets from us. </sentence><sentence id="112">And we were -- it was there, we felt totally apart from it. </sentence><sentence id="113">We felt as though we were not welcome to join it. </sentence><sentence id="114">This was for Germans and that Jews were not welcome in these -- in these <span class="interior space">circles</span>, or at least in this crowd. </sentence><sentence id="115">And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with longing to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a part of it. </sentence><sentence id="116">Just wasn't possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? </sentence><sentence id="117">I don't think so, not in that way. </sentence><sentence id="118">I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all of this, but no, it was -- it was not -- it was not to be and there was too much fear attendant to trying to be a part of that. </sentence><sentence id="119">We knew we wouldn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Because? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: We knew we wouldn't be welcome. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: How did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Well, we had any number of personalized experiences in that -- this was a time when we started <span class="building">school</span>, and we were -- we went to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, which I think This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="126">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="127"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog deg March 10, 2001 wa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews to go to the <span class="building">public schools</span> or to the -- to other <span class="building">schools</span>, we had to be in separate <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">And in those <span class="building">schools</span>, walking <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>, we were often chased by Nazi youth. </sentence><sentence id="129">We made it our business to stay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us as we went from <span class="building">school</span> back to <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">But it didn't happen all that frequently, just, you know, once -- oh, it's so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did -- it -- all that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child. </sentence><sentence id="131">And we did, we just -- my brother and I learned how to run very fast and we ran. </sentence><sentence id="132">We went -- ran <span class="building">home</span>, and that was that, when they bother us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: You -- you used the expression Germans and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="143">Did you not feel German in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: I didn't have a sense of nationality, not at that age. </sentence><sentence id="147">I kn-knew we lived in -- in the <span class="country">country</span> that we lived in, which was <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="country">Deutschland</span>, that was our <span class="country">country</span>, but my association was that we were really not a part of it because of our Jewishness. </sentence><sentence id="148">My parents I don't think had that feeling so much. </sentence><sentence id="149">They felt themselves as being German. </sentence><sentence id="150">And -- but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I -- there were other incidents that I can relate to you where I was -- where I recall how they tried to d---to keep Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="151">So, did I feel German? </sentence><sentence id="152">I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. </sentence><sentence id="153">I do know that I was very much interested in geography. </sentence><sentence id="154">My parents spoke often of <span class="country">America</span> and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="155">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="156"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog deg March 10, 2001 that was very interesting for us. </sentence><sentence id="157">You know, where is <span class="country">America</span> and what is happening there, and why is it so great, and -- because they made it sound very, very interesting, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="158">And then we learned ab -- all about -- my father was -- tr-traveled a lot. </sentence><sentence id="159">So when he was abroad and he -- all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was traveling in <span class="country">Great Britain</span> and in <span class="country">Holland</span> and he told us about his trips. </sentence><sentence id="160">And this was all very fascinating for us. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, we were in -- I never really had a -- you -- to get back to your original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time. </sentence><sentence id="162">Fascinating interest with the world and different <span class="country">countries</span>, but no sense of nationalism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: We spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="184">That was the only language that we knew. </sentence><sentence id="185">Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the -- the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to <span class="building">shops</span> or look, and you would see signs in the <span class="building">store</span> windows, Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. </sentence><sentence id="186">And you felt strange going into those <span class="building">shops</span>, although shopkeepers often didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="187">They -- they welcomed you because they -- you were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would happily sell you things. </sentence><sentence id="188">But the signs, nevertheless were in the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and in the <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">One in particular I think goes back. </sentence><sentence id="190">We used to go to a <span class="dlf">beach</span> on the <span class="env feature">Rhine</span> and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy bathing in the <span class="env feature">Rhine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">I wanted to learn how to swim. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="192">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="193">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="194"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="195"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog . </sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">March 10, 2001 The interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student on a long string attached to its waist and on a <span class="spatial object">pole</span> and just held them there in the <span class="env feature">water</span> so that they'd learn how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="197">We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that. </sentence><sentence id="198">Anyway, we'd go to the -- to the <span class="env feature">beach</span> quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun. </sentence><sentence id="199">Kids love that, and we loved it. </sentence><sentence id="200">Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that <span class="env feature">beach</span> and se -- and said, what does this mean? </sentence><sentence id="201">I mean, we've been coming here for years. </sentence><sentence id="202">Oh, oh, no, it -- she said, this doesn't apply to you, you can -- you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs. </sentence><sentence id="203">So although we -- we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down several s -- degrees -- more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in -- in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="204">We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to -- th-the <span class="region">Rhineland</span> has got many, many interesting historical sites and <span class="building">castles</span> etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed. </sentence><sentence id="205">We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just went -- did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there. </sentence><sentence id="206">Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="region">Rhineland</span> overall was not -- I don't think the people in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="208">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="209"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="210"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog " March 10, 2001 <span class="region">Rhineland</span> were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="211">But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. </sentence><sentence id="212">Except for a few. </sentence><sentence id="213">Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and -- and for me as a child, particularly the -- the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. </sentence><sentence id="214">I don't remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination. </sentence><sentence id="215">My brother and I used to -- we found our way to the <span class="building">circus</span> once. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">When we were supposed to be coming <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span> we got on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a <span class="spatial object">streetcar</span> and went out to the circus. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">And of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come <span class="building">home</span>?

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Well we were -- we were close as youngsters, so we did everything together and when we had a desire to do something, at least we had somebody to do it with. </sentence><sentence id="231">So, we were adventuresome. </sentence><sentence id="232">I don't think that we were abnormally risque. </sentence><sentence id="233">We did the things we wanted to, but we also hewed to being <span class="building">home</span> and -- and doing our studies and listening to the things that we needed to, listen to our parents, and when they said ja--do your homework, we did our homework and all those things. </sentence><sentence id="234">So we were not wild, as such, but we had our moments when we wanted to go out and have some fun, and we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: N-Not at that age, we were too young. </sentence><sentence id="245">Athletics didn't mean very much at age six, seven, or five. </sentence><sentence id="246">Four, five, six, seven.

remember those -- those years, was that it was always difficult for my parents to get all the things they needed in the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252">Things were in short supply, particularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. </sentence><sentence id="253"><span class="country">Germany</span> was not well supplied in those things and there were

information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog (c) March 10, 2001 as I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and we found that -- my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to subsist on and all -- often -- I-I don't remember us starving, I don't remember us having any difficulty in -- in getting the things, the substance that we need -- the subsistence things that we needed. </sentence><sentence id="256">I do know, I remember my mother talking about how har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess epitomizes, that we went -- we were going to go to my grandparents in <span class="populated place">Deutz</span> and we --my father loaded us in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and he had gotten -- apparently in -- in <span class="populated place">Deutz</span> my grandparents couldn't get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh eggs, which were also in very

</sentence><sentence id="260">My father was not injured. </sentence><sentence id="261">But during the time, he was so concerned -- you know how nervous one gets when something like that happens, his

name. </sentence><sentence id="2392">And I said -- I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I'd like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this is what I'm ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2393">And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? </sentence><sentence id="2394">And he didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="2395">He just sat there. </sentence><sentence id="2396">And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn't I? </sentence><sentence id="2397">And I said, you know, I've just said everything that I need to say. </sentence><sentence id="2398">If he's not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. </sentence><sentence id="2399">For once in your lifetime, don't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2400">So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don't know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which is ridiculous, you know, you" re sitting there and you're wondering what you're going to do, and beginning to sweat. </sentence><sentence id="2401">Should I get up and leave, what? </sentence><sentence id="2402">And he suddenly said, yup, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2403">Now, I don't know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And I won't ever question it. </sentence><sentence id="2405">But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="2406">So I learned a lot from that experience. </sentence><sentence id="2407">I stayed with that company, I wasn't happy there in <span class="region">New England</span>, and moved back to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father's partner for some years. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And we -- and I got

Interview with Alfred Schnog &gt;&gt; March 10, 2001 was -- he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. </sentence><sentence id="2414">He was in his 70's, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I'm probably about the same age he was when he retired. </sentence><sentence id="2415">And so, with my father's help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we said, let's go out in business and start the business. </sentence><sentence id="2416">And I figured that <span class="building">Ben Livingston</span> had a good reputation in the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2417">If he stayed active in the <span class="building">business</span> for just three years, we'd have enough grounding in order to be able to -- to run the <span class="building">business</span> without him. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Well, we did. </sentence><sentence id="2419">We went out, found a small office in the <span class="building">Lincoln building</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. </sentence><sentence id="2420">And we started to build the <span class="building">company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as -- he's -- he was -- h-he lived until he was 89 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2422">He came into the <span class="building">office</span> every single day. </sentence><sentence id="2423">He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for -- for many years. </sentence><sentence id="2424">We -- I finally took over as the president of the <span class="building">company</span> and it was extremely successful, it worked out quite well. </sentence><sentence id="2425">Into -- one of the interesting incidents I'1ll never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80's already and found it difficult to get around. </sentence><sentence id="2426">He was using a <span class="spatial object">cane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2427">He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility. </sentence><sentence

sending <span class="spatial object">missiles</span> over and bombing <span class="country">America</span> and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2447">People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in <span class="populated place">New York City</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2448">And we were walking up <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span>, straight up <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2449">And <span class="populated place">Ben</span> got pretty tired.
