<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Will you tell me your full name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: I'm William P. Levine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="9"> A I was born on 1| July 1915 in <span class="populated place">Duluth</span>, <span class="region">Minnesota</span>, the cold <span class="country">country</span>, at the head of the uh <span class="env feature">Great Lakes</span>, <span class="env feature">Lake Superior</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Would you tell me something about your family and growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Uh I'm the oldest of uh four boys and uh growing up in <span class="populated place">Duluth</span>, <span class="region">Minnesota</span> is like growing up in a very small <span class="populated place">provincial town</span>, although the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Duluth</span> is was in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand people, still it had a very small <span class="populated place">town</span> characteristic. </sentence><sentence id="14">Uh everyone knew everyone else and uh there didn't seem to be the uh clicks and the groups and the uh animosities almost uh that you might find in a very large, <span class="region">metropolitan area</span> where you have the people congregating and living in <span class="region">areas</span> uh that, with people they're familiar with or that speak the same language or are from the same <span class="region">part of the world</span> initially. </sentence><sentence id="15">So I suppose uh I didn't have that feeling about living in <span class="populated place">Duluth</span>, and it was...I find it very refreshing when I compare uh that kind of metropolitan life to that of a smaller <span class="populated place">town</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="16">Laughter) So it was very...it was a lot of fun. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh I did all the normal things a young boy might do. </sentence><sentence id="18">I played a lot of hockey and baseball. </sentence><sentence id="19">That seemed to be very important in my young life, and of course I went to the various grade, the <span class="building">grade school</span>, <span class="building">junior high school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span>, <span class="building">Duluth Central High School</span> in fact. </sentence><sentence id="20">It seems that every <span class="populated place">town</span> has a <span class="building">central high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">Certainly <span class="populated place">Duluth</span> did, and uh then I went to the <span class="building">University of Minnesota</span> and uh I married in 1941, and the war broke out and uh I felt I was, had a responsibility to my uh wife which uh helped me uh decide that I would not enlist into the Army and the fact that I'm a devout coward may have also had something to do with it, but nevertheless uh uh I was drafted in 1942, and that's when I went into the Army, and somehow...this is I suppose you might consider it an aside...uh it wasn't long after I was in training in <span class="region">Texas</span> that I felt I wanted to become a commissioned officer which would have given me a greater degree of latitude in my own movement, my own performance and execution of what I thought was proper, although within the constraints of the military of course, and that I might be of a greater value not only to myself but to the Army. </sentence><sentence id="22">And fortunately for me, uh I was allowed to appear before a Board and take the various tests necessary and qualified uh to go to the <span class="building">Officer Candidate School</span> uh which I completed in early "43. </sentence><sentence id="23">And uh I was an artillery officer and went into intelligence in the <span class="building">artillery branch</span> and went overseas in "44, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: What did you do...excuse me...in the <span class="building">intelligence branch</span>? </sentence><sentence id="36">I want to get some...I'd like to get some sense of this. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="38">Well uh in the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> we primarily were involved in uh the <span class="region">area</span> of uh reconnaissance uh to determine the <span class="region">area</span> of our operations, what the...uh what was in those <span class="region">areas</span>, what effect it might have on our units that were performing there, and what they should anticipate and uh in addition of course uh to uh bring all matters of intellige...of an intelligence nature to the commander for the <span class="building">headquarters</span> in which we were working, so that the uh decisions that were made uh could be uh probably more effective, if you will, and uh our preparation for our operations in those <span class="region">areas</span> could be far more effective. </sentence><sentence id="39">Uh this essentially was the the <span class="dlf">field</span> in which I worked, and uh so this, of course it it goes into much greater detail uh but I think this is, probably answers your question. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: What happened (cough)...excuse me...when you went overseas? </sentence><sentence id="41">Where were you sent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Uh I first went to <span class="country">England</span> and uh there was involved for a short time in the uh defense of the uh <span class="region">east coast</span> of <span class="country">England</span> on the <span class="region">Channel area</span>, where the buzz bombs were at that time being employed against uh the uh <span class="env feature">island</span>, and uh so from that uh point we crossed the <span class="env feature">Channel</span> and I think that was my first uh uh impact I suppose of the uh horror of war. </sentence><sentence id="45">Uh in wading on on to the <span class="dlf">Normandy coast</span> uh the uh <span class="dlf">Utah Beach</span>, why I saw a young soldier whose who had been decapitated by an explosive uh on the <span class="dlf">landing site</span>, and it's...can be rather disconcerting, especially for the first time in the throws of getting your feet off out of the wa...cold <span class="env feature">water</span>, and uh as safely as you possibly can, so it was rather uh quite disturbing. </sentence><sentence id="46">However, when you're occupied with your own performance, your own safety and the with the mission that you were given to accomplish why you soon push that back in the back of your mind so that uh you can do what you were required to do. </sentence><sentence id="47">So this is what uh I was involved in at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="48">And I recall I suppose and the sight never left me, when for the first time I saw a sign identifying a <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">It was a <span class="spatial object">porcelain-covered sign</span>, a <span class="dlf">white border</span> with <span class="dlf">blue field</span> and with white lettering and the word Ste. </sentence><sentence id="50"><span class="populated place">Mere Eglise</span> was impressed upon that uh road sign. </sentence><sentence id="51">I was more impressed with the <span class="spatial object">sign</span> I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="52">In fact it was such a gorgeous <span class="spatial object">porcelain unit</span> uh for a street sign or a road sign, when I was used to seeing something painted on a piece of metal uh back <span class="building">home</span>, and uh I guess that that stayed with me...I thought of it many many times for just no reason. </sentence><sentence id="53">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="54">Just that it impressed me. </sentence><sentence id="55"><span class="dlf">Ste.</span> </sentence><sentence id="56"><span class="populated place">Mere Eglise</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">That name became a headline for a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: It certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh as you started moving deeper into <span class="country">Europe</span>, did you start hearing about anything, about what was happening uh to the prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: I assume you're speaking perhaps of the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">At that time, no. </sentence><sentence id="78">Uh even in the intelligence circles that I was involved in, I heard nothing about the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and the conditions within these <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was later, as we moved uh toward <span class="populated place">Paris</span> uh that we began getting information and I suppose in a sense information normally is uh dispensed or dispersed whatever the case might been, uh to those who had a need to know. </sentence><sentence id="80">And in the <span class="building">intelligence circles</span> the intelligence personnel had a need to know earlier so that they could process that information and develop it for the utilization  of their commanders, and it was in this context that I began to get uh some information, rather sketchy, and somehow it didn't have the meaning that I learned later. </sentence><sentence id="81">It was a bit of information that was...well, I know it know now and uh uh sufficiently sketchy so it it had no form at that time. </sentence><sentence id="82">It was uh much later when uh we were east of uh <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and I use <span class="populated place">Paris</span> as a geographical key uh and we began to approach <span class="country">Holland</span> that the information uh began to uh take more shape because there was more information involved. </sentence><sentence id="83">The uh fact that we had not reached an <span class="region">area</span> where there was any possibility of our troops making contact with these <span class="region">areas</span> that uh contained a <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> may have been a reason why uh the great detail was not forthcoming, at least at our level. </sentence><sentence id="84">Then uh I would say it was probably in uh February or March, if I recall correctly, that we were moved uh into the <span class="region">7th Army area</span>, which is south of where I was involved with the uh first with the 3rd Army and then the uh 9th Ar...9th Army then the 3rd Arm...I'm sorry...9th...3rd Army, then the 9th Army, and I skipped the 1st because that was between the uh 7th and the uh 9th and went uh south to I think at that time it was <span class="populated place">Nance</span> (ph), uh they were located there, the <span class="building">headquarters</span> at that time. </sentence><sentence id="85">Let me back-track a moment. </sentence><sentence id="86">Before we went <span class="region">south</span>, we had penetrated uh <span class="country">Germany</span> at <span class="populated place">Aucken</span> (ph) uh from <span class="country">Holland</span> and uh it was then that the information relative to the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> began coming in with a greater degree of of frequency and with greater detail. </sentence><sentence id="87">However, being moved to uh the <span class="building">7th Army</span> all of a sudden it seems that information uh slowed down, uh apparently uh and quite actually we were not the proximity to the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> was far greater. </sentence><sentence id="88">We didn't have, we weren't as close any longer, so the possibi...pardon me...the possibility of having to know what was going on was far less, the the immediacy was was less. </sentence><sentence id="89">I would say that uh after the 15th of March, roughly, the ___ of March, shortly after that uh we began getting uh a great deal of detail about uh the uh conditions in the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and one of the reasons that I felt we were getting it was because our <span class="dlf">axis</span> (ph) of advance was going to take us through an <span class="region">area</span> which would include <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and some of us would be in the direct path of that <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Others of us might be a little bit south or north, but at that moment we didn't know which of us, which <span class="spatial object">units</span> would be directly involved until we got a little bit closer to that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: What kind of information were you getting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: We were getting information to the effect that the uh health of the people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> was uh very, at a very low level and that there would be a great need for medical support and assistance. </sentence><sentence id="109">This is the kind of information we would have to know to be prepared to handle a situation, should it have uh should we find that. </sentence><sentence id="110">Additionally, uh we're getting information to the fact that uh to the effect that the uh conditions, the uh...not only with the health uh part (ph) but some of reasons for that poor health were being surfaced. </sentence><sentence id="111">Uh sickness comes from many sources. </sentence><sentence id="112">It could come from contact with a sick person. </sentence><sentence id="113">It could come from a lack of food. </sentence><sentence id="114">It could come from the lack of the proper food. </sentence><sentence id="115">It could come from the lack of medication as a person becomes ill and then there's no medication whatsoever, why then obviously that person would be and may die. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh there was a  being moved from one location to another, one <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> to another. </sentence><sentence id="117">The reason for that information being uh forthcoming was that the troops in the <span class="region">north</span> were over beginning to get very close to and were beginning to overrun uh the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in their <span class="region">area</span>, so before that occurred in some instances, prisoners were moved from places like <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> uh to places like uh <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, which were further...we were further from that <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> than they were from their's, so this begins to give you a picture of how the information began to filter through and uh uh be become...we began to develop our own needs because of the information we were getting. </sentence><sentence id="118">Somehow I...upon reflection I did not feel or the picture that perhaps that was developing in my mind almost had no relationship to what existed. </sentence><sentence id="119">This is perhaps the difficulty uh in describing in sufficient detail what we did not see but are only being told about a scene, about an uh event that transpired or that is currently uh transpiring, so there was no way I suppose that I could bring myself to the point where I felt revulsion or horror. </sentence><sentence id="120">We had all been in combat. </sentence><sentence id="121">We had seen uh death in very violent forms, and uh not that you become hardened to it, but you learn to live with it in a fashion that uh I guess mentally your mind permits yourself to or one's self to accommodate the problem, so that the mission we are uh required to perform can be accomplished without interference, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="122">And then by way of definition I suppose of how I was accommodating the matter, I I imagine this is how most people handle it. </sentence><sentence id="123">When we got quite close to the uh <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, obviously the information that I was we were required to give our commanders had to be in greater detail than earlier, so that uh the <span class="spatial object">units</span> can be configured or the personnel uh brought in, uh specialists in one <span class="region">area</span> or another whether it be a skill involved with medical uh problems or a skill involved with uh the <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> that we would need or uh acquire...uh whatever. </sentence><sentence id="124">This is one of the reasons for uh the for that kind of information being brought to the attention of the commander, so that we can be properly prepared to accomplish what we were required to do uh knowing as much about we will find in a particular <span class="region">area</span> as possible, such as is that <span class="region">area</span> uh highly industrialized? </sentence><sentence id="125">Is it a <span class="region">farming area</span>? </sentence><sentence id="126">What is it we were going to find? </sentence><sentence id="127">Are the people there uh intensely patriotic to their cause? </sentence><sentence id="128">Are they uh are they not? </sentence><sentence id="129">All these factors become part of the decision making process of the commander. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: How did the information come in about the <span class="populated place">camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: You say uh did it come...well... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: What were your sources I guess I'm asking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Uh the sources usually came from <span class="building">higher headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">They although the information that we gained from units that worked with us, either on the side of us, on either side of us or we we get information from prisoners that we uh take from the opposing units, from the Germans or, German units, or we get them from civilians that we uh run into in the <span class="region">areas</span> that we are beginning to occupy, so uh these are all sources of information. </sentence><sentence id="160">Some of the information that we do get in this fashion we merely pass to our <span class="building">higher headquarters</span> or the adjacent <span class="building">headquarters</span> so that they can refine that information and process it into a  larger picture that they have access to, so this is uh development of how uh we were operating in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">The interrogation of uh of prisoners of war and of civilians was a highly skilled uh process and developed a great deal of information. </sentence><sentence id="162">And of course we have other kind of...find ways of getting information as well. </sentence><sentence id="163">So that takes us uh to the <span class="region">area</span> of our primary interest. </sentence><sentence id="164">The uh...if I recall correctly it uh was on the 29th of April in 1945 that uh we moved into the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">It seemed to me if I recall again, it wasn't a bad day. </sentence><sentence id="166">A lovely day, as days go and <span class="populated place">Bavaria</span> is a lovely part of the world, and it seemed so incongruous to be in a lovely part of the world uh and that beautiful blue <span class="env feature">Danube</span>...I couldn't help but uh harken back to that that wonderful waltz. </sentence><sentence id="167">Uh it it just didn't seem to fit into why we were there and what we were doing there, and then especially I suppose walking into the uh <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Uh I suddenly realized that the shock of seeing what I was told what I might expect to find and I've had some experience I suppose in uh receiving intelligence information as to what I might expect in an <span class="region">area</span>, whether it be uh uh <span class="building">factories</span>, whether it be people uh that are antagonistic or not so...whatever. </sentence><sentence id="169">And then to find that I was so far off the mark. </sentence><sentence id="170">I should have been shocked before. </sentence><sentence id="171">I shouldn't have to wait to see what I saw to be to to experience this kind of shock but I guess I was accustomed to seeing violence and death and sickness as a result of combat, not because people uh were housed in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> with no arms, no weapons uh and not as a result of their violence. </sentence><sentence id="172">This coupled with the uh with so many...I mean it wasn't just one or two...everybody I looked at had that same sick, uh large eyes in a uh skin colored uh skeleton skull. </sentence><sentence id="173">And there was...you could see in many of them happiness at what they were seeing but the kind of happiness that they were reflecting uh reminded me of someone that was about to die and had enough hearing to hear a pleasant sound and uh uh you had to concentrate carefully to see their smile, that there was pleasure in what they were either seeing or hearing. </sentence><sentence id="174">If you've been in a foreign <span class="country">country</span> where you're not familiar with the people and let's say an oriental as a case might be...in this particular case, initially all the orientals look alike, but to an oriental, the orientals don't look alike. </sentence><sentence id="175">To a caucasian the differences are great. </sentence><sentence id="176">You can...can't count the...you you can't list the number of differences there is from one person to another, one group to another. </sentence><sentence id="177">When I saw these people, if you want to call them people, there was no...they all looked alike. </sentence><sentence id="178">They all looked like that came out of a mold, the same mold. </sentence><sentence id="179">They were just uh very difficult to look at. </sentence><sentence id="180">Uh emotionally it was very difficult, I suppose uh...not I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="181">I know. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh you didn't want to look at your own buddy. </sentence><sentence id="183">I didn't want to look at them. ( </sentence><sentence id="184">Pause) (Coughing) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Take your time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: It's very difficult to...1 suppose...we feel we're adults and we can handle anything (coughing) when you suddenly you realize that you are not handling something as as you as well as you would like. </sentence><sentence id="215">Kind of embarrassing. </sentence><sentence id="216">So I I suppose this was part of the problem there, if you want to call it a problem. </sentence><sentence id="217">Compared to what I was looking at, compared to those people I had no...I was in clover. </sentence><sentence id="218">I had no problem. </sentence><sentence id="219">The degrees of sickness was unreal. </sentence><sentence id="220">Sure people were dying of hunger, but not so much as they were dying of sick...typhus and the lack of medication. </sentence><sentence id="221">Uh the the sicker a person is, the less  they even want to eat, let alone...and they can't eat, so they were dying from almost a self-starvation at that point. </sentence><sentence id="222">Not to mention uh what I learned later of course...the method of people dying. </sentence><sentence id="223">The uh...obviously the mission of the uh military is to accomplish its objectives whatever they might be. </sentence><sentence id="224">It's not necessary to go into that uh as much perhaps as it is uh that we do need a record of what we do for many reasons, uh historical being one obviously. </sentence><sentence id="225">One to indicate perhaps is this something repetitious? </sentence><sentence id="226">Is it something that's a one time thing that could have occurred? </sentence><sentence id="227">Whether it...regardless of the event or the mission or the objective, so along those lines then some of us were required to uh debrief the uh prisoners and also the uh people in the little of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> uh which was part of the <span class="region">complex area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">However, I do think that uh it's important to tell the story of what what were these people...I'd love to be able to debrief every person, not only of about their life in their <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but where they come from, what were they...the thousands of people. </sentence><sentence id="229">This <span class="populated place">camp</span> was activated in 1933 to house eight thousand uh political prisoners...people who didn't believe as uh the uh Third Reich, the uh Hitler believed, uh his people. </sentence><sentence id="230">Not only from <span class="country">Germany</span>, from other <span class="country">countries</span>, wherever they might be. </sentence><sentence id="231">But of course as time went on, the numbers increased and the reasons changed slightly if you want to call the uh effort of dis...disposing of all the Jews in Europe a slight change, be my guest, but that's far from a slight change. </sentence><sentence id="232">So by the time we got there, the <span class="region">area</span> was, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was housing close to sixty thousand inmates. </sentence><sentence id="233">Of course some of them had recently arrive...recent arrivals from other <span class="populated place">camps</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: General, could I ask... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: Can you describe a little more before you go on to the interrogation, uh in addition to the people walking around, can you take us through the <span class="populated place">camp</span> as you saw it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Well, the...there was a uh a <span class="spatial object">train</span> of <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, <span class="spatial object">rail cars</span>, on the <span class="dlf">siding</span>...well, not a <span class="dlf">siding</span> really...on the <span class="dlf">main line</span> into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that was uh parked there. </sentence><sentence id="261">Uh that uh <span class="spatial object">train</span> had just arrived and uh there some bodies in the in the uh <span class="spatial object">train</span>, some along side the uh <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh they had just arrived, that uh that <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and when we got there the uh there were very few guards uh in in uniform uh in within the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">Many of them had already uh left. </sentence><sentence id="264">The uh arrival of our forces was not concealed all that well. </sentence><sentence id="265">There was no need to conceal our arrival uh and they were aware of the possibility that they wouldn't fare very well if they were still in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> uh when we arrived...from two sources, from from from from us, from the soldiers and also the uh inmates. </sentence><sentence id="266">Of course the strength of the inmates was such that they didn't have much to fear uh from them in bodily harm but they had some fear of bodily harm from them. </sentence><sentence id="267">The stages of of death and dying was a <span class="spatial object">kaleidoscope</span> that I don't think there is any possibility of picturing it really, of of someone lying uh on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> in their uh inmate uniform with their eyes open...didn't look really different from someone who was upright, except that they were lying on the on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">Uh the detailed difference was the position that they occupy there. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was...their arms might be...and their legs didn't look too comfortable so that you had the feeling that they were  in the throws of uh of dying and spasmodic muscular uh responses or whatever, so they...in that sense they looked a little different. </sentence><sentence id="270">The...L...we wanted to give them something and and do something for them, so we reached out and uh one young man uh was about to fall and I reached out and I uh prevented him from falling and I saw that he he was quite weak so that if I just let go he would fall, so I lifted him and he wasn't very heavy obviously and I carried him to a...uh inside a <span class="building">building</span> and laid him on a <span class="spatial object">cot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh they had these tiered uh <span class="spatial object">benches</span> almost uh...they didn't have any bedding really, and our medical personnel was was uh we were augmented with additional medical people and they began treating the uh uh inmates. </sentence><sentence id="272">The...as an aside I suppose I could uh relate an incident uh...and you can bring me back to where I am later if you can, if you remember...uh I was delivering a talk at the uh at the uh I think it was  sufficiently adequate, so we much be alert and watchful. </sentence><sentence id="273">After the initial uh impact of having uh entered the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we began more orderly performance of our duties and uh uh in my case we uh some of us were debriefing the inmates as to uh their experience, what...how they were treated, under what circumstances they did this or that, whatever the case might have been, whether it was work, whether it was uh uh food, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="274">And uh we did learn uh and it was corroborated uh repeatedly uh independently uh of uh one another because each of the inmates were interviewed separately and so that no one was overheard by another, that the uh medical atten...attention was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="275">It just didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="276">It wasn't there to keep them well. </sentence><sentence id="277">Uh there was a feeling that there they weren't needed to be alive, that if they died it was just as well...that kind of...that was the attitude. </sentence><sentence id="278">That was the pervasive feeling throughout the uh <span class="building">facility</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">There were cases where they would uh, the guards would take a large group of prisoners into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> quite a distance from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> at night during the cold weather and hose them down, after they were called upon to remove their clothing, and left there all night and the guards would return and most of them were gone or dead by morning. </sentence><sentence id="280">Uh there were those that were taken by <span class="spatial object">transport</span> during the day to work in various uh <span class="building">factories</span> or in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> which brings us then to the people of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> because the people of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> lived there. </sentence><sentence id="281">They lived right adjacent to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">You couldn't move out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> without without running into some of the citizens. </sentence><sentence id="283">It was like a small <span class="populated place">town</span> with a main <span class="dlf">road</span> going right through it, or the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> going right through the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">So the the stench of the of the <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span> wasn't confined within the <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">The sounds, the people crying...it wasn't in a vacuum. </sentence><sentence id="286">When the people were taken by <span class="spatial object">transport</span> through the <span class="populated place">town</span> to reach a <span class="building">factory</span>, to reach a <span class="dlf">field</span> to work in, people didn't turn...1 mean they had eyes and they had ears. </sentence><sentence id="287">Some of the SS personnel that administered the <span class="populated place">camp</span> lived in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">They didn't live on the uh in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">They lived in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="290">Uh upon the interviewing process of the personnel, the uh citizens of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, I remember having interviewed a man who was a traveling person. </sentence><sentence id="291">He traveled from his <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> to other <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">He was a traveling person, and he seemed to know more about what was going on in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> than those who were never, had never left. </sentence><sentence id="293">And he confirmed all the things that the inmates had indicated as regards anything that transpired outside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">Some of the things that even transpired within the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> because under certain conditions, certain supplies and things were brought in by the people that lived in the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, so they also saw the <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">They saw some of the people, some of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="296">When we would ask why didn't you do something, why did you do all the things you were doing that supported or administered to the needs of that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you got a variety of answers, all within the same framework however. </sentence><sentence id="297">I would say that the most of them felt they had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="298">That's what they would say. </sentence><sentence id="299">That the...they felt if they didn't comply that there would be reprisals against them, that they would loose their livelihood, that they would...they might suffer some kind of incarceration or penalty. </sentence><sentence id="300">Uh I recall one man was a uh a union person, of all things. </sentence><sentence id="301">He was about I'd say in his late or early for...early fifties, late forties, early fifties if I recall, and he was a very stubborn person and he refused...the only one we every ran into uh and I talked to some of the other people who were doing the uh debriefing...going into the debrief...debriefing process...who had absolutely refused to do anything for the authorities when it came to  supporting the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">And he said he knew what was going on in there. </sentence><sentence id="303">He had never been inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but he talked to his friends who had and he never uh complied with their requi...and they didn't do a thing with him. </sentence><sentence id="304">They left him alone. </sentence><sentence id="305">You would think that he might set an example, that others would say well, they didn't do anything to him. </sentence><sentence id="306">They won't do anything to me. </sentence><sentence id="307">That's the difference in people I guess. </sentence><sentence id="308">But to say that the people of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> did not know what was going at in uh in <span class="populated place">Dac</span>...in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>...no way. </sentence><sentence id="309">They did know. </sentence><sentence id="310">We were all satisfied that they knew and I'm convinced that they knew that we knew that they were aware of what was transpiring. </sentence><sentence id="311">They couldn't bring themselves to admit their own weakness. </sentence><sentence id="312">I suppose a lot of people are like that. </sentence><sentence id="313">Who wants to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: How did they claim not to know? </sentence><sentence id="369">What was some of their arguments? </sentence><sentence id="370">What did they tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: They would hide behind their own description of what they saw or heard and their description of what they saw or heard was I would say far less than accurate or they would describe a different reason for what they may have heard or what they may have seen. </sentence><sentence id="375">Example: if they see someone who is uh uh being mistreated, being hit with a with a rod, uh they would say that he is being prodded to do something he didn't want to do and was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="376">If they see someone who is who is almost falling down sick, they say well, I'm sure that they'll take care of that person when they get to the uh in...inside where they have doctors. </sentence><sentence id="377">Uh when they would see these people marching out...now this was hard to accept...uh into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and then being hosed down, I found it very difficult to accept anyone because they would see these people coming back in the morning and they saw how many people left. </sentence><sentence id="378">How could they not know something could have, had to have happened to a lot of people? </sentence><sentence id="379">Weren't they, where were they taken?Well, they would say maybe they were taken to another location that they're not aware of, you see. </sentence><sentence id="380">There's so many ways that they tell themselves, to absolve themselves of any complicity or responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="381">They're very adept at...everybody has a...is adept at that to a some degree, but they were quite...well, when you talk to them and they'd tell you...or ask them questions and they respond, obviously you take them at their word. </sentence><sentence id="382">If you know different, you prod them a little or as much as you dare before you frighten them off completely so they won't respond at all. </sentence><sentence id="383">Because you do want as much information as you can get. </sentence><sentence id="384">It's late in an interview with a person that you really stick it to them, because you think you have as much as you really need, but if you can get more, great. </sentence><sentence id="385">If it takes a little of this to get it, do it. </sentence><sentence id="386">So we went that <span class="dlf">route</span> as well. </sentence><sentence id="387">We didn't have to do that with the prisoners however. </sentence><sentence id="388">They were quite willing to uh...well, we had to verify things that they said because you know, the imagination and time and pain and illness uh can play tricks on a person, so we used uh many uh interviews and we brought them together to verify the uh information that we received. </sentence><sentence id="389">Now there are archives in the uh...I'm convinced...in...unless you already have them, of the reports that were developed. </sentence><sentence id="390">You probably have them. </sentence><sentence id="391">Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: Could we go back, a little bit...again really to two things, but let's start with one. </sentence><sentence id="412">You  0 described when you entered the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and you had started to tell me about a <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="413">Could you tell me more about what was in that <span class="spatial object">train</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Well, actually I did not spend as much time as perhaps I'm not sure I should have, because it wasn't my mission I suppose, but I looked into uh two <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and saw the uh dead bodies there and reported to one of the medical people that they should uh do something about that. </sentence><sentence id="418">Uh it's a hazard. </sentence><sentence id="419">Uh death should not be left unattended for long. </sentence><sentence id="420">The uh stench was uh horrible uh both of the human excrement and actual death, because I'm I'm confident that there was death before the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped. </sentence><sentence id="421">There had to be. </sentence><sentence id="422">The uh...there was one person...I'm trying to remember now...that came to me...I think it could have been in <span class="country">Israel</span>, one of my trips there...a survivor who claims that he was one...he was on that particular <span class="spatial object">train</span> and saw our troops uh as they moved in. </sentence><sentence id="423">Uh I don't recall having seen him and I'm sure he didn't recall having seen me. </sentence><sentence id="424">The difficulty with recalling some of the things that may have occurred, that did occur on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is that I didn't see the exodus of the people from the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and had it already occurred uh we could have been on the other side of the <span class="dlf">track</span> approaching from that side when it already had been unloaded, but there were uh some bodies along side the the <span class="spatial object">train</span> as well. </sentence><sentence id="425">The uh...and they were in uniforms other than the uniform of the people that we ran into in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, so that's how we also verified the fact that they did not uh come from <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">They were brought in from another <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="427">The uh...I have pictures...one of the things that I uh didn't find that I had surfaced uh some years, a few years ago...in fact this brings to mind I guess in a sense why I'm even here...uh after the event, the <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> event, I felt for my own sanity that it would be just as well if I didn't uh dwell on that uh entire matter. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was very uncomfortable and it was...I had difficulty uh performing my own requirements, my own mission and still with that on my mind and I found uh comfort in not remembering, so much so that uh it was probably over a year later that I returned to the States. </sentence><sentence id="429">I didn't...uh yeah, in "46...middle of "46 I returned to the <span class="country">States</span> and uh with all my effects, my <span class="spatial object">footlocker</span> and all my equipment and the papers that I had developed and the pictures uh from that point were in my <span class="spatial object">footlocker</span> and I never opened that footlocker for thirty-eight years and uh never my told my uh late wife or my children of any details of that event whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="430">And so...because it was more comfortable for me. </sentence><sentence id="431">But somehow I felt they didn't have to know. </sentence><sentence id="432">Their life was comfortable and pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="433">There was no point I felt at that time. </sentence><sentence id="434">And it wasn't until I believe if I recall correctly it could have been "82 perhaps that I was asked to uh speak to a uh <span class="building">high school</span> assembly on my experiences during World War II in <span class="country">Europe</span>, which was an innocent enough innocent enough request and I said I would be pleased to do so. </sentence><sentence id="435">This was quite early. </sentence><sentence id="436">This had to be perhaps uh...I'm trying to think whether it was the fall of "81 or early "82...in any event it was April of "82 or of that year that I was told uh about a week to ten days prior to the event what my subject was going to be, in detail. </sentence><sentence id="437">That it was not to be my experience in general, but more specifically the matter of <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, because they had learned that I was involved with <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and I'm not sure I knew how. </sentence><sentence id="438">And I wasn't sure whether I could handle that, but I felt that I had made the commitment and I perhaps should and I did appear and I was asked if I would appear in uniform and I said no, I'd rather not. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="440">I repeared...appeared in civilian clothes, talked to all the young students about my  1 experience there. </sentence><sentence id="441">I didn't handled it very well. </sentence><sentence id="442">I broke down before I was through, which I thought I might and it bothered me to think I would. </sentence><sentence id="443">And I also learned later on that they wanted me to come back and speak to a smaller group on the next day and then a smaller group on the sec...third day. </sentence><sentence id="444">And that night I said well, I will, yes. </sentence><sentence id="445">But this time I'll "ll appear in uniform, because I learned that they thought I was a European that happened to be there in that <span class="region">area</span> at that time, that I was not a member of the United States Armed Forces, and that I felt it was important that they understand my perspective. </sentence><sentence id="446">I wasn't an inmate. </sentence><sentence id="447">I was a hardened soldier, because I had gone through all of it. </sentence><sentence id="448">And that's the person they should be listening to. </sentence><sentence id="449">So I did appear in uniform on the second and third day. </sentence><sentence id="450">And it was then that I realized fully that the picture I was given as an intelligence officer before I got to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> didn't prepare me a little bit for what I found. </sentence><sentence id="451">The shock couldn't have been greater. </sentence><sentence id="452">It could have been greater perhaps, but I don't see how because there was no real relationship between what I was able to picture from my information to what I really found there. </sentence><sentence id="453">Then how can I, that many years later and that...one or two generations removed, tell them how it really was so that they will make sure it'll never happen again. </sentence><sentence id="454">That's why I appeared in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="455">That's why I'm here now. </sentence><sentence id="456">Cause it isn't easy, but it's worth it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: Stop and change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="506"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1  2 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="509">Q: General, can you tell me what the reactions of your men were to what they saw and can you repeat the question, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: With regard to the reaction of the people that were with me as we moved into uh the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I daresay they all knew I was Jewish and all of us were aware of the fact that the primary population mix was Jews in these <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> at the time that we were moving into them. </sentence><sentence id="512">So they probably felt that if they looked at me they may get a clue as to what they should be feeling or exhibiting, much the same as if you're at a a movie and somebody's laughing...you look next <span class="dlf">door</span>...somebody's really laughing...well, you laugh a little bit with them, or you cry with them, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="513">Somehow there was independence of people, and earlier I may have mentioned the fact that uh perhaps there was some embarrassment at exhibiting how one was reacting to something like...such a horror, yet I didn't pay much attention to their reaction as they didn't pay a lot of attention to mine, to me. </sentence><sentence id="514">We were all rather bug-eyed at what we were looking at. </sentence><sentence id="515">It was almost in disbelief that we saw this horror. </sentence><sentence id="516">There was one young fellow actually began to sob. </sentence><sentence id="517">And if I recall, he was an Ital...uh an Italian kid and he cried softly...he was just sobbing. </sentence><sentence id="518">I never got around to asking him why he felt so badly other than the horror that we were looking at may have taken him in that fashion. </sentence><sentence id="519">Another fellow if I recall correctly just looked almost as if he wasn't seeing anything. </sentence><sentence id="520">His eyes weren't even focused on anything. </sentence><sentence id="521">And as far as I myself is concerned I guess in the sense I almost identified with some of them because I was Jewish, and yet the overriding uh uh feeling I had was not that as much as uh what could these people have done to have deserved to be put in this kind of condition, and I reflected momentarily on how long they must have been there to have...you can't suddenly be like that over night, so they have had to lived through a process, a horrible process to have arrived at this condition, which just boggled my mind. </sentence><sentence id="522">I reflected to a certain extent uh and very briefly on the fact that someone had to know much more than I of actually what was happening here for a far longer time than I, and how is it possible that noth...nothing was surfaced to have uh either indicated a revulsion for this kind of performance or something far more tangible. </sentence><sentence id="523">I just have no...I just...it just sort of went through my mind and I was too busy and involved with what I was doing to to to...but I do recall that having uh raced through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="524">The uh...I hadn't entered any of the <span class="building">buildings</span> until this man uh that I had uh I had indicated he was about to fall and I prevented from falling and carried him into that <span class="building">building</span> because I felt that he had to be in some kind of uh uh <span class="dlf">enclosure</span> instead of out in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> there, and uh the uh...the uh the <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> were were very crude uh and I thought of my God, how can these people uh lie and sleep and rest on these hard wood boards when uh their bodies had no meat, just skin and bone. </sentence><sentence id="525">That's a horrible uh feeling when you're, you have no meat on your bones and you're lying on something else, they cushion you. </sentence><sentence id="526">But I think that some of them were just beyond feeling. </sentence><sentence id="527">They almost had to be. ( </sentence><sentence id="528">Pause) I'm not sure I could describe the uh the uh interior of the of these <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="529">Uh you you look at them with eyes that are...you're not just uh looking at a at a <span class="building">building</span> or an <span class="interior space">interior</span>. </sentence><sentence id="530">You're looking at what what had to happen there to these people to be in the condition they were in, how they had to live uh  3 and I and it bothered me more later I think because I learned that through the debriefing process that uh what they, how they lived and what they did to one another uh in the name of survival and it...and some of the things that they did had to be uh well, some people are stronger than others I suppose or some not as strong as others, so that they would do things to protect themselves in the direction of surviving...if it was food...if it were uh uh to tell uh one of the uh officials, the hierarchy, whether it be a kapo or what whether it be one of their own that had a responsibility for a particular portion of a <span class="building">building</span>...the things that they would say and tell about one another was unbelievable, because it may mean a uh perhaps a morsel of food more than they might have gotten otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="531">It may have been uh that they would be uh allowed to live a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="532">The threat of death had such an impact in spite of the fact that these people were near death already, but you never know...they probably didn't realize that, that they would do almost anything for one more day, because one more day brought them closer to a point where they thought they may be out of there and free and in a better situation. ( </sentence><sentence id="533">Pause) It was impossible how they could live like that. </sentence><sentence id="534">Animals live better. </sentence><sentence id="535">And we're talking about somebody's father, somebody's brother, somebody's son. </sentence><sentence id="536">All you have to do is think of one's self. </sentence><sentence id="537">I have brothers. </sentence><sentence id="538">I have a father. </sentence><sentence id="539">But for whatever I'm not one of them, but they are...that can tear you up. ( </sentence><sentence id="540">Pause) Somehow if I could ever describe the <span class="building">structure</span> and maybe that would help too. </sentence><sentence id="541">I can't. </sentence><sentence id="542">I just can't. </sentence><sentence id="543">I just can't. ( </sentence><sentence id="544">Pause) I've said more than I think I could have. </sentence><sentence id="545">People have to know however, in spite of my inadequacy, that the world cannot survive another event such as the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="546">It can't. </sentence><sentence id="547">We will loose all our humanity because we've lost a great deal of it then, so I'm not sure we could we could survive as a as people if some of these people would permit an event of that nature to occur again. </sentence><sentence id="548">It can't. </sentence><sentence id="549">And I'm sorry...I wish I could do more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: I've felt so inadequate. </sentence><sentence id="596">Once this matter came out, when it was recognized as something that should be dealt with, I guess I felt comfort in numbers but the the real comfort never came. </sentence><sentence id="597">It hasn't come yet, so when it does maybe I'll be able to do a job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
