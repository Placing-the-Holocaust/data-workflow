Germans --" she thought we were Germans -- "When you Germans are going to be in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, the Jews will come back from <span class="country">Sweden</span>." </sentence><sentence id="207">And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="208">And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no? </sentence><sentence id="209">When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the <span class="env feature">Christmas trees</span> were still in the people's <span

id="216">And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened. </sentence><sentence id="217">Because the mo- most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know. </sentence><sentence id="218">And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that's why I was back a couple of times to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell. </sentence><sentence

the <span class="dlf">door</span> and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm. </sentence><sentence id="234">And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the <span class="dlf">Umschlagplatz</span> to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="235">And that's where they took all the people, to the <span

she saved our lives." </sentence><sentence id="240">And I said, "Yeah, because if she hadn't taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn't told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives." </sentence><sentence id="241">What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there. </sentence><sentence id="242">And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="243">And so, anyways, we went This is
