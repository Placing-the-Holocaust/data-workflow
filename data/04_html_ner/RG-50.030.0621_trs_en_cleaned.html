<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: For me it's very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="19">I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the <span class="building">museum</span>, but all those people have been single people when the war started. </sentence><sentence id="20">I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="21">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="22">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="23"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 And we -- it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I'm still living with the horrors I lived through in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a <span class="spatial object">database</span>, or do you mean that like we're doing an interview with Fanny right now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="170">S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that's otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the <span class="building">museum</span>, or calling us or writing me for that information. </sentence><sentence id="172">That's one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="178">S: Well, we work in a <span class="building">registry</span>, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they're very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways. </sentence><sentence id="179">And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from -- she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several -- working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. </sentence><sentence id="180">And we often get This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="182"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg deg April 21, 2011 requests not only for individual information, but information based on place. </sentence><sentence id="183">So for instance, all the people who were from -- in <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span> for instance, <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, or from a particular <span class="populated place">town</span>, or share a ca -- particular experience, and with our database, we're able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I had a particular request for people who were -- somebody wanted information from those who were in <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>, who were registered with us. </sentence><sentence id="185">And Fanny was able to help me to --I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. </sentence><sentence id="186">That was one database. </sentence><sentence id="187">The other infor -- information -- the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that's a list of the deportations that took place in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">And this particular collection is based on date, date of convoy only. </sentence><sentence id="189">And also, it was producing. </sentence><sentence id="190">It was <span class="country">Belgian</span>, so it was in <span class="country">Belgian</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="206">I think in <span class="country">Belgium</span> we have French and Flemish, as -- as languages, so -- S: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: So which language was it, of those two? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="209">S: This is in French, okay, you're right, you're right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: It was in French, okay, sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="213">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="214">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="215"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg a April 21, 2011 S: But because of Fanny's background in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, I thought it would be a good fit, and this -- this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. </sentence><sentence id="216">And before each -- it's divided by <span class="spatial object">convoys</span>, before each name list of those on the <span class="spatial object">convoys</span> is a description of that <span class="spatial object">convoy</span>, and -- in French. </sentence><sentence id="217">And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: But cle -- thank you, Steve, because I -- I --I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened. </sentence><sentence id="225">This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. </sentence><sentence id="226">And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f -- that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. </sentence><sentence id="231">And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. </sentence><sentence id="232">Also, when we got the book from <span class="country">Belgium</span>, further descriptions, the number of <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, the number of people in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and how many transport, at the same time the <span class="building">museum</span> got a book called "The Hidden Heroes." </sentence><sentence id="233">That book was written by a German reporter. </sentence><sentence id="234">She is from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="235">She tried to interview peop -- Jewish people in <span class="country">Germany</span> and nobody wanted to give her any information. </sentence><sentence id="236">Somehow, she was so determined, she came to <span class="country">Belgium</span> and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="237">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="238"> Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">The <span class="interior space">underground</span>, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that. </sentence><sentence id="240">So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that book wasn't selling too well, and they had -- she had to change the title, to "The 20" <span class="spatial object">Transport</span>." </sentence><sentence id="242">And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in <span class="country">Belgium</span> more people survive, because the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. </sentence><sentence id="243">Where in <span class="country">France</span> they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">And this is why in <span class="country">Belgium</span> only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can't even find the names, who organized in <span class="building">convents</span>, in <span class="building">churches</span> and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, including my own child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: That's amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: So wou -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: And many of the words from the documents from <span class="country">Belgium</span>, I did not know because I didn't learn English of those documents. </sentence><sentence id="268">So Steven would -- made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="269">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="270"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg " April 21, 2011 to know. </sentence><sentence id="271">Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span>, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students. </sentence><sentence id="272">So we really -- my job really was, can we help you? </sentence><sentence id="273">And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in <span class="country">France</span>, with the picture from the <span class="interior space">room</span> where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="274">And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer. </sentence><sentence id="275">And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing. </sentence><sentence id="276">So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the <span class="spatial object">computer</span>, to get the -- all the information, which he typed for him to take. </sentence><sentence id="277">So he didn't have to go to so many places, because he was originally in the right place. </sentence><sentence id="278">So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular place, because he knows the answers to everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Well, it -- to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the <span class="interior space">Belgian underground</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Youre right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: That must have been -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable -- there's another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven't done to such extent. </sentence><sentence id="309">Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent. [ </sentence><sentence id="310">indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven. </sentence><sentence id="311">He made sure that I would be speaking up. </sentence><sentence id="312">He said, if you don't do it now, when you gonna do it? </sentence><sentence id="313">And I know I'm old, so I had to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="320">But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Steve? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I'm very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="325">So that's why I say -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Steve, we're putting you on the <span class="dlf">spot</span> all right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: No, I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="328">He knows I'm not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
