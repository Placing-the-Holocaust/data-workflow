<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Uh...My name is Fred Bachner. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, September 28, 1925, and I lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I grew up in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> until the age of...uh...thir, fourteen. </sentence><sentence id="5">I..uh...went to the Jewish...uh...<span class="building">public school</span> because...uh...as a Jew we were not permitted to go into the <span class="building">German schools</span> so it was a completely Jewish...uh...uh...sustained...uh...<span class="building">schools</span> within the <span class="building">school system</span> and...uh...1 grew up and I learned during the growing up in the <span class="building">school</span>...uh...Hebrew and English, which was...uh...uh...taken on an extended program. </sentence><sentence id="6">I went to <span class="building">school</span> from 8 o'clock in the morning til about...uh...3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, with | hour of break for lunch which we were supplied by the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">And ... uh...we had a very happy environment until the... uh... German laws started to tighten down and...uh...prohibited the Gentile people to associate with us Jews by... uh...starting out...uh...uh...forbidding us to go into certain places such as <span class="dlf">parks</span> and <span class="building">restaurants</span> and...uh...<span class="spatial object">buses</span> and <span class="spatial object">trains</span> which...uh...was...uh...very well advertised in the anti-Jewish newspaper, the Sturmer, in which always had the big Jewish face with a big hook nose is a  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection wanted me to learn the whole <span class="spatial object">Haf Torah</span> which was Hazin (ph) and also the <span class="spatial object">Maftir</span> (ph) and I...uh...felt very, very honored to be able to...to learn it and to perform before my relatives and the congregation and...uh...it took a hard...a long time for me to learn it but I managed it and when I...the day of my Bar Mitzvah, which was before the...uh...Kristallnacht and as it turned out, one of the very few Bar Mitzvahs left to be performed because... uh ...Kristallnacht was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> on November 9th, where all the <span class="building">synagogues</span> and <span class="building">schools</span> were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="8">Uh...I...1 remember vividly that I woke up and the Kristallnacht was on the ninth of November...uh...and I got up in the morning and it was about 6:30 in the morning because I had to walk to <span class="building">school</span> which was a little bit of a distance from where we used to live and...uh...but the <span class="building">school</span> was situated with the...uh...<span class="building">synagogue</span> in back of the <span class="building">building</span>, a very big <span class="building">synagogue</span> and...uh...I came...I left my <span class="building">house</span> to go to <span class="building">school</span> and...uh...I seen how the SR was...uh...destroying Jewish...uh...<span class="building">stores</span> and Jewish <span class="building">apartments</span> by...uh...breaking the glass and throwing the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and...uh...all be...belongings out on the <span class="dlf">street</span> for destruction, just setting it afire or people just grabbing it and walking away with it. </sentence><sentence id="9">And as I reached the <span class="building">school</span>, well I didn't know what to do there because the curt...window curtains were hanging out and the <span class="building">synagogue</span> in the back was practically destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="10">The...uh...<span class="spatial object">ark</span> was open, the Torah was...uh...taken out, the Hebrew books were put in the middle there and set afire, and I was very distraught and didn't know what to do so my first thought was to run back <span class="building">home</span> and see if my <span class="building">house</span> and my parents are alright. </sentence><sentence id="11">Thank God...uh..nothing has happened to our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and...uh...we lived through the...uh...the assault without any damages except that there was a...uh...a...uh...search for people to look...to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> because...uh...the Rabbi in...in our <span class="building">synagogue</span> in his last speech said and I vividly remember it today, he said, "It doesn't become daytime before it really gets night." </sentence><sentence id="12">And what he tried to tell us that it is going to get worse before it's going to get better. </sentence><sentence id="13">And naturally peopled started to take this into consideration and they started to talk about leaving <span class="country">Germany</span> any which way possible and there was an onslaught of the <span class="building">Consulate</span>, appeal by <span class="country">Columbia</span>, <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and...uh...any...any...any <span class="country">nation</span> that...that would accept you to go without waiting for long term visa to come to the <span class="country">United States</span> and...uh...that...that was the start of the exodus...exodus ...from the Jews from <span class="country">Germany</span> although...although this didn't last long because at the end of November, it was the assassination by a...uh...student by the name of Greenblat * in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to a...uh... German  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection regularly. </sentence><sentence id="14">You couldn't change your <span class="interior space">apartment</span> without the permission from the police, and with the...uh...you had to give them...uh...everybody who is living there, their full name, their Jewish name or whatever it was, and...uh...then they had...uh...also the religion. </sentence><sentence id="15">So to pick out the Jewish...uh...names from...from the <span class="building">Police precinct</span> was a pretty...uh...easy task. </sentence><sentence id="16">So this how things started to get worse, that all the Polish citizens were...uh...rounded up and my father and my mother were Polish citizens and automatically my brother and I became Polish citizens because according to the German law that you are...you...you become the nationality what your parents are. </sentence><sentence id="17">And...uh...my father and my brother were deported to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span> was not prepared of the onslaught of thousands of people and for security reasons because the <span class="dlf">border</span> was very close with <span class="country">Germany</span>, they...uh...kept these people in <span class="populated place">camps</span> at the <span class="dlf">border</span> until they were screened and got the permission to go into <span class="country">Poland</span> where they were born...to the place where they were born. </sentence><sentence id="18">And so...uh...my father and my brother were picked up and they were on the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to <span class="country">Poland</span> and they were detained at the...uh...<span class="dlf">Polish border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">They were there for 2 weeks until they got the permission to proceed to the...uh...place where my father was born and where our family lived. </sentence><sentence id="20">And..-uh...my late mother and I...we were not permitted to join them, so all of a sudden things have changed...uh...financially because there was no money coming in anymore. </sentence><sentence id="21">We had the big <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">My father was a well-to-do person in his own way in <span class="country">Germany</span> and...uh...we had to sort of...uh...see how we can sustain ourselves by...uh...by doing some necessary...uh...adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="23">Now...uh...we had a big <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, five <span class="interior space">rooms</span> with a <span class="dlf">service entrance</span> and so on and so forth, so we...we thought that we would rent out a...uh...a..uh... <span class="interior space">room</span> and...uh...take somebody in to live there, and we rented it out to an elderly couple, and they moved in with us and they paid us rent which helped us to sustain ourselves to the time, you know, that...uh...until we can meet...uh...be together with my father and brother. </sentence><sentence id="24">And...uh...we...uh...my mother did...uh...a few...uh...things. </sentence><sentence id="25">She was a pretty good seamstress in her own way, and I did some odd work, deliver paper or whatever it was and got some income as far as that was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="26">It was only pennies, but...uh...every, every penny helped that time. </sentence><sentence id="27">And...uh...my father, as I mentioned before, after 2 weeks was...uh...capable to join...to go proceed to the place where he was born and to establish himself and wait for our arrival. </sentence><sentence id="28">Now the Polish government issued...uh...a red stamp in your passport that permitted you to return to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">On the interim we had some cousins in <span class="country">America</span> and we wrote to them that things are bad, we need visas, which they started to...uh...to..-uh...proceed with and they finally got the visas and they were issued to us about a week before we left <span class="country">Germany</span> and...uh...then we had to...uh...have them transferred from the <span class="building">American Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to the <span class="building">Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">Now the...uh...Polish quota for...uh...Polish citizens to come to the <span class="country">United States</span> was...there was a 4 to 5 year wait so that picture didn't look very bright, but I must say that the <span class="building">Jewish Agency</span> was working very, very hard to get the kids and the youth out of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, out of the fire, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="31">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="32"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and my grandparents from my mother's side, they left <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in 1935 and they settled in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">And...uh...we were in touch with them and...uh...they said we have...you register for...for a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and then you will be able to proceed from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> either to <span class="populated place">London</span> or to <span class="country">Israel</span>". </sentence><sentence id="34">So we packed up a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> and put it (chuckle) next to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and...uh...L...1 made...I was sort of prepared, you know, to leave my mother and...uh...that I might get a telephone call. </sentence><sentence id="35">That's all we would have gotten and be at the...in 5 hours at the <span class="building">train station</span>, and you're gonna go with that <span class="spatial object">transport</span> to...uh...to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh...I also was registered in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to go on a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> direct to <span class="country">Israel</span>" on Aliyah, but unfortunately, as it turned out that phone call never came and the...uh...letter for <span class="country">Israel</span> never came either because in June 1939, we got the call from the Polish government to come and pick up the...the stamp...that we are able to leave <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">And...uh...so my late mother and I, we went to the Polish government and got that stamp, you know, and we left the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and...uh...on the interim, in the meanwhile it was too hard...these people got sick and anyhow I don't remember exactly what happened to the elderly people that lived with us, but...uh...we...uh...we moved out of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and moved in with another...uh...another couple on the same...same <span class="building">building</span> on the <span class="interior space">first floor</span> and rented one <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">Now we became the...(chuckle)...the...uh...tenants. </sentence><sentence id="39">And...uh...when we left, we left everything there. </sentence><sentence id="40">And uh...we didn't have anything to sell because we sold our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and this sustained ourselves to live...uh...to have food come in...in..-uh...and as long as we were by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="41">Now the big moment came and we purchased the tickets and we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span>...uh...to my father's...uh...to my father and my brother to be reunited. </sentence><sentence id="42">And naturally where upon arrival it was a great...uh...great occasion, you know that being separated for almost a year and a half that we...uh...finally got together. </sentence><sentence id="43">So now came the worry for my father...what to do and where...where to establish himself because he...he didn't know by himself what to do in the interim...uh...in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and he...uh...sort of waited for us to wait for a decision what my mother wanted...thought what the family should do. </sentence><sentence id="44">So naturally we took...uh...sort of a vacation and...uh...my father and my mother...we...we went to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">And...uh...we tried to rent an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> there and to have whatever we had...the few <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> go and, you know, we used to live with my father's family there, which graciously took us in. </sentence><sentence id="46">I mean, you know...uh...in <span class="country">Europe</span> there was no such thing...there was <span class="interior space">room</span> in the smallest <span class="building">hut</span> like they used to say, you know, and....uh...and...uh...it came...came the time that we thought that we finally be able to carry on with a normal life because I would have to enroll into <span class="building">school</span> and to learn to...how to speak Polish which is a pretty hard language. </sentence><sentence id="47">And I...uh...then...then all of a sudden on September Ist, there was already a rumor and a feeling that war is imminent  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and it might start any day because the Polish government started to issue orders that you tape up your <span class="dlf">windows</span> because from the air raid the <span class="dlf">windows</span> might crack and they shatter on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and hurt people and what not, you know. </sentence><sentence id="48">So the feeling was already that there is going to be a war. </sentence><sentence id="49">And sure enough they started...uh...in...in August, they started to dig <span class="dlf">trenches</span> around the...the <span class="populated place">city</span> where...uh...the...uh... homefront would defend that <span class="populated place">city</span> and they were...they were full gung ho that they're going to beat the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="50">But I couldn't see that with the horses what they had...not...not being mobilized at all, that they're going to have any kind ofa success you know. </sentence><sentence id="51">And the geographic situation of the <span class="populated place">city</span> where my father was, it was not too far away from the <span class="dlf">German border</span> and it was only 10 kilometers away from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, from <span class="populated place">Oswiecim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I will come back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="53">And...uh...we....the Declaration of War was on September Ist. </sentence><sentence id="54">Naturally, right away we had air raids, and we had all kinds of...uh...war threats that the Germans beat the Pole...Poles, and the they take already and this <span class="populated place">town</span> and this <span class="populated place">town</span> and we should evacuate the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">So the people started to pack up on <span class="spatial object">baby carriages</span> and <span class="spatial object">hand carriages</span> and they started to march out of the <span class="populated place">town</span> into further away from the...from the <span class="dlf">border</span> to be in a <span class="region">safe zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">So...uh...we took everything into a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> and we grabbed a <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span> and put it on top of the <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span> and our family we started to hold ourselves together and started to march to evacuate further in..into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">Now I don't remember exactly how many kilometers we marched or so, but it was...uh...I don't know, it was about...we managed in...in 4 days, in 5 days to go about...uh...100 kilometers or maybe 70 kilometers and we walked across the <span class="dlf">fields</span> you know, because the...uh...corn was already taken in and the hay and the potatoes were...only the potatoes were still out in the <span class="dlf">field</span> because this is a very big <span class="region">farm country</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">So...uh...we started to go further and we...we walked further and who do we meet there? </sentence><sentence id="59">The German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="60">Because they got ahead of us, not...not by...on the...on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, but they were parachuting in to the...to the <span class="region">advance areas</span> and securing the <span class="region">advance areas</span> and when we came, you know, the...we come there, we see the German soldiers and they said, "Oh, Go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">Go back <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="62">That's all you...they ever use... "Whatever <span class="populated place">city</span> you are from, go back <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="63">And right there and then they started a big anti-Semitism by the soldiers to...to see....the Jews...the religious Jewish people used to have beards, and big pais (ph), you know. </sentence><sentence id="64">And...and you...you wouldn't believe it but they started literally to rip out the beard and rip out the thing, and you know...uh...so the Jews, you know, they started to...to take a bandage around the...the...uh...the chin and hide the hair from the beard in there, and when the German came, you know, you had a toothache or headache or, you know, whatever it was to...to save themselves with the beard. </sentence><sentence id="65">And that's...that was actually the beginning of the atrocities that they had. </sentence><sentence id="66">And after...after a couple of days we came back to the <span class="populated place">village</span> which we left and everything... everything has changed. </sentence><sentence id="67">The German Army occupied the...the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="68">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="69"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="populated place">collection village</span> or I should say maybe the <span class="populated place">city</span>, whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="70">And the...uh...they started to take every...uh...capable person who could perform any kind of...uh...work, they grabbed you off the <span class="dlf">street</span> and they took you in one of the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they carried you away to perform some kind of work for the army, whatever it is...clean the <span class="building">barracks</span> or clean the horses, you know, whatever it is to...uh...uh...to make it comfortable for the army. ( </sentence><sentence id="71">Pause, drinking water) So that was the beginning of establishing <span class="populated place">work camps</span> which was supervised by the German army and it was that if you were a...first of all there was a...a...uh...order out that every humanbeing...every male person at the age of 12 or 13 has to work. </sentence><sentence id="72">Otherwise, you wouldn't get any food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="73">Otherwise you would not get any privileges and if you are caught in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and you cannot document that you have a job, they take you and work you away. </sentence><sentence id="74">So that is how my brother got caught and...uh...now he didn't get caught. </sentence><sentence id="75">There was an order out that all the...uh...Jewish males between the age of 14 and 18 have to register at the <span class="building">police department</span> and...uh...that..-uh....that all of was change because they establish a <span class="building">Jewish community center</span> where...like we have here in <span class="country">America</span>, that you have a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, you have a president and a vice president and so on and so forth, and they established that for the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">And they did all the work for the Germans registering. </sentence><sentence id="77">You were registered there and they know everything where you lived and all that. </sentence><sentence id="78">And...uh...that was the legal...uh...that you were legalized and permitted to live there. </sentence><sentence id="79">So you had to register in that...uh...that <span class="building">agency</span> you I will call it, and..uh...you...and they had...uh...and after...after you register...after 3 or 4 days everybody registered, then they sent a policeman to your <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and they took you down to the <span class="building">police station</span> and they carried you away to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> that was in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="80">Now <span class="country">Germany</span> uprooted <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and you had to take the roots out because that's where they built the <span class="dlf">autobahns</span>, you see. </sentence><sentence id="81">And at the later date, about a year or 2 later, they built <span class="building">factories</span> there because they suffered heavy losses in the <span class="region">West</span> where the German industry was and they relocated the <span class="building">factories</span> north to <span class="country">Poland</span> and so on and so forth where they could perform...work on...on ammunition and guns and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="82">And that's where the workers...uh...got into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and these <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they were erected overnight and...uh...that's where my brother was taken to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> at the 1940. </sentence><sentence id="83">So again, was a disruption in the family life. </sentence><sentence id="84">I had to go and register to work and my father and my mother and so on and so forth, and I...I was...1 would say lucky or not, but I befriended myself with a...a Jewish girl and...uh...she was about 2 years younger than I was, and her father owned a...uh...a..uh...distribution center of sodas and beer. </sentence><sentence id="85">And when all this...these things started to tighten down, I said, "You know, I got to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="86">Can I get a job with your father." </sentence><sentence id="87">She says, "Sure, my father will take you down." </sentence><sentence id="88">Now by the time I...I...I tried to procrastinate it as long as I could, you know, and in the...in the meantime, the father's business was taken over by a Volksdeutsche. </sentence><sentence id="89">That is a person who is Polish but has German ancestry in him, you see. </sentence><sentence id="90">So he just came in your <span class="building">business</span> and he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="91">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="92"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was the boss and all that. </sentence><sentence id="93">So...so L...so her father spoke to the guy and he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="94">So what...what was the work, and I was...that time I was 14 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="95">Uh...I was permitted...I was not permitted, I was given a team of horses and a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> which I had to load in the morning with <span class="spatial object">beer barrels</span> and sodas and all that and go around in the...in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and, you know, deliver it to the...uh...<span class="building">stores</span>, the <span class="building">luncheonettes</span> or the...uh...the <span class="building">bars</span>, you know, wherever they...they sell beers. </sentence><sentence id="96">And...uh...it was a...a very demanding job because I had to get up at...uh...5...uh...o'clock in the morning and go to the <span class="building">stable</span> and clean the horses, water them down, give them hay to eat and...yah...and then go out and load the big <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> up, you know, and take the <span class="spatial object">beer barrels</span> and...and lift them on God knows what you know. </sentence><sentence id="97">So L...I did that and...uh...as a...as a young kid, I was capable of adjusting myself to it, and I took care of it the best possible way and it was pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="98">I mean the guy was tickled pink because I managed how to drive a team of horses and...uh...in winter time we...uh...drove a <span class="spatial object">sled</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">And...uh...there was no...no <span class="spatial object">cars</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="100">I mean there were very, very few...uh...<span class="spatial object">cars</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> or <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and...uh...it took a lot of learning to control a team of horses to...uh...get the <span class="spatial object">sled</span> or <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> down the <span class="dlf">hill</span> that...uh...pushes a load...pull a load, you know, and you go down the steep <span class="env feature">hill</span> and the horse has to hold it back and, you know, so it's ...uh...it's pretty dangerous, let me tell you. </sentence><sentence id="101">So my brother was in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> and we got....uh...mail from him at...uh...14 days intervals or later or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="102">My father was working in a <span class="building">factory</span> for the army to make...uh...<span class="spatial object">coats</span> and so was my late mother, but they worked in different shifts. </sentence><sentence id="103">And I was working in the <span class="building">beer brewery</span> and...uh...1 was distributing beer and...uh...soda. </sentence><sentence id="104">Now all of a sudden the...in the surrounding of that <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="populated place">camps</span>...uh...<span class="populated place">POW

I am talking about already the...uh... going into the winter of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="550">And...uh...the snow was pretty deep there. </sentence><sentence id="551">The reason I mention that because we...we wore wooden shoes and the snow sticks to wood, you know. </sentence><sentence id="552">So when you had the wooden...uh...shoes, you know, not only that couldn't you walk with them, but

any...uh...razor blades or shaving cream and we shaved the best way we could. </sentence><sentence id="559">You...you used to have...uh...uh... rashes on your skin that...uh...looked... looked like an
