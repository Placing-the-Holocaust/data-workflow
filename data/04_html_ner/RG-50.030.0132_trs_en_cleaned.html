<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well when...then everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="149">When the war started the...uh...the Nazis came in. </sentence><sentence id="150">They were in 5 o'clock in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">We lived on the <span class="dlf">border</span>, German...<span class="dlf">German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">They came in 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="153">The armies marched in. </sentence><sentence id="154">Powerful army. </sentence><sentence id="155">I mean as a kid I remember I see Polish armies marching. </sentence><sentence id="156">The most powerful thing I ever saw, and they came with <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="157">Everything mobilized the proper way. </sentence><sentence id="158">The Polish army was riding on  horses and the <span class="spatial object">artillery pieces</span>, two horses were dragging the <span class="spatial object">artillery pieces</span>, preparing for the German army. </sentence><sentence id="159">They declared war and they were in <span class="populated place">town</span> the same way. </sentence><sentence id="160">And when they marched in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, they put signs on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> that says you know, destroying is very hard...very easy, and <span class="building">building</span> is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="161">All people should live together and get along. </sentence><sentence id="162">Jews, gentiles, and everybody and <span class="building">building</span> a future because your government was corrupted and from now on everything be fine. </sentence><sentence id="163">So we read that <span class="spatial object">sign</span>, figured well it's not too bad. </sentence><sentence id="164">How bad can it be. </sentence><sentence id="165">Okay, a day passed by and the next day we hear...we're sitting in the <span class="building">house</span>, you know, everybody sitting, you know, hiding, not to stick your nose out too far, and we hear shooting and shooting and shooting. </sentence><sentence id="166">We thought who knows what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="167">We didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="168">We thought maybe the Polish armies coming back, which was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="169">Then they...uh...the police, the German Gestapo and the SS came into the...to the <span class="interior space">court yard</span> and start screaming we should get out. </sentence><sentence id="170">Get out! </sentence><sentence id="171">Get out! </sentence><sentence id="172">He says and they start saying that someone was shooting at them. </sentence><sentence id="173">That was their excuse to start the trouble. </sentence><sentence id="174">And they dragged everybody out. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh...the...the people which were...my brothers were at the age of 17, 18, or 19, they were dragged down to an <span class="populated place">army camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">Me and my mother and my sister...no, my sister wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="177">My sister was in another <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">Me and my mother and an older brother was dragged into a <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">The <span class="building">church</span> was a block away. </sentence><sentence id="180">We came to the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">We saw bodies laying all over....by the <span class="building">church</span> there laying bodies because they were shooting constantly at anybody who was going, passing by. </sentence><sentence id="182">They accused us that we were shooting at them, which I don't believe nobody ever would dare shoot at them. </sentence><sentence id="183">Came to the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, the <span class="building">church</span> was stuffed with people. </sentence><sentence id="184">You know, they just stuffed us in. </sentence><sentence id="185">It was so hot that we couldn't breath. </sentence><sentence id="186">Finally, one German had a pity so he took that long stick to open the...the <span class="dlf">windows</span>, the <span class="dlf">Gothic windows</span> and busted the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">A little <span class="env feature">air</span> came in. </sentence><sentence id="188">Horses were in the <span class="building">church</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="189">They pushed in horses. </sentence><sentence id="190">They were doing all over. </sentence><sentence id="191">And...and eventually L...I looked at the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="192">| didn't see much of them. </sentence><sentence id="193">They had a signed on their buckles, "God with us." </sentence><sentence id="194">You know, that means God is with us. </sentence><sentence id="195">That's...every buckle on the German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="196">I figured maybe it's true. </sentence><sentence id="197">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="198">And we stayed there over night. </sentence><sentence id="199">And meanwhile the...the Pollacks were building <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> for the...when the Germans...for the Germans come in so they're building <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> to protect the...uh...in case <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> march into <span class="populated place">town</span>, they had some <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">The <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> would go into the <span class="dlf">hole</span> and never come out. </sentence><sentence id="201">But this never materialized. </sentence><sentence id="202">They filled up all the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> with dead people. </sentence><sentence id="203">Just piled them up to the top. </sentence><sentence id="204">Some was still alive, you know. </sentence><sentence id="205">The next day they let us out of the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">We walked <span class="building">home</span> side..side...on the side of the <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">We were afraid to walk in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="208">You get blown away. </sentence><sentence id="209">Came <span class="building">home</span> and a couple of days later, everybody was sort of released from the <span class="populated place">army camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">My brothers came back and...and it got quiet. </sentence><sentence id="211">And then we knew already what it...what...what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="212">Because you can't...you knew already that they pulled a fast one, what's gonna happen. </sentence><sentence id="213">Then slowly, we...they used to come around. </sentence><sentence id="214">They...we formed a...a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> was formed like a work for the...the Nazis if need anything. </sentence><sentence id="215">One day they came and they say that the Jews should...uh...give all the cameras....you have cameras. </sentence><sentence id="216">Then if you have any fur, if you have any expensive <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, so you have to bring it down to the <span class="building">church</span>...in the <span class="dlf">court yard</span> in the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">Carried it down yourself, and if they liked it just keep it. </sentence><sentence id="218">If they didn't like it, they say bring it back. </sentence><sentence id="219">So and then every week was something else. </sentence><sentence id="220">And then they start...they see the...uh...they wanted to squash down all these things in case there be a riot or something against the Germans, so they decided to take all the  intelligent people and try to put them in...in certain <span class="building">prisons</span>, they put them in. </sentence><sentence id="221">And the time when this was going on...for a year, they <span class="building">building</span>...they had built a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="222"><span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. __ </sentence><sentence id="223">they called it. </sentence><sentence id="224"><span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">That <span class="populated place">camp</span> was built for...for people like undesirables they called, and for intelligent people. </sentence><sentence id="226">Polish engineers, professors, all these people they...they picked up and shipped them there. </sentence><sentence id="227">And they shipped them, and a week later the wife or the children got a package in the mail and they opened the packages, there was these clothes over there and they say he died of an incurable disease. </sentence><sentence id="228">This was going on for almost a year. </sentence><sentence id="229">And they were sending out everybody. </sentence><sentence id="230">Anybody who was sort of intelligent, teachers, principals, anything which had something to organize. </sentence><sentence id="231">They were afraid if someone would organize, and if they had only a bunch of people, common people, no one would organize. </sentence><sentence id="232">This was going on and they were given notice to the <span class="populated place">community</span>, any Jew has gold he should report the gold and we did that and we did a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="233">Finally, we were start working in...in slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="234">They used to take us out every night. </sentence><sentence id="235">There was snow and they dragged us out and put us to the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> in the middle of the night to clean...clean the snow from the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">And then they...we had a little <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> where we used to go there. </sentence><sentence id="237">So they used to take...some pick up...some most beautiful ladies, they picked them up, brought them to the <span class="building">hospital</span> there, raped them and undressed them and made fools out of them, and then they released them. </sentence><sentence id="238">That was fine. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was no...not as bad then. </sentence><sentence id="240">And like I said, they're shipping out people this one the other one. </sentence><sentence id="241">And finally came a time they say we're going to form a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, a <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">They want the Jews to be separate from everything. </sentence><sentence id="243">They formed a big <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> had around 39,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="245">People...they're weren't so many Jews living in <span class="populated place">town</span>, but when the...uh...the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed, people from other <span class="populated place">town</span> which suffered more figured they'd come here because this maybe be a little better place to live, so people from all over, from the outskirting communities, little <span class="populated place">villages</span>, all came into the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">And it was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="247">And that was going on for a short time. </sentence><sentence id="248">And then the war...and then the war started between <span class="country">Russia</span> and the Russian-Germany. </sentence><sentence id="249">The pact was broken. </sentence><sentence id="250">And that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="251">Everything was not bad. </sentence><sentence id="252">I mean it was bad, but not bad. </sentence><sentence id="253">But when the Germans start losing the war, when the Russians put up a fight and the Germans seen it's not working well, then they start taking care all these...they start going after the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="254">They decided to...uh...start sending people out. </sentence><sentence id="255">They claim they're sending them to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="257">So they...uh...took the...took the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">They locked the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in. </sentence><sentence id="259">You couldn't get in, get out. </sentence><sentence id="260">All the <span class="dlf">streets</span> were locked with the Gestapo SS. </sentence><sentence id="261">And when they locked these things then the...they had a chief of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="262">His name was Degenhauf. </sentence><sentence id="263">He came with his cronies and stood in...at a certain <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="264">He picked a certain <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">Everybody got out of this <span class="dlf">block</span> and he was passing by. </sentence><sentence id="266">And everybody was passing by in front of him, and he decided which way to go. </sentence><sentence id="267">Left and right. </sentence><sentence id="268">I didn't know which way was good. </sentence><sentence id="269">Left or right. </sentence><sentence id="270">Now I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="271">Then I knew what was good. </sentence><sentence id="272">So he picked out...let's say he picked out from a <span class="dlf">block</span> of 10,000 people, he picked out 500, 600 and send them in to a...to a <span class="building">steel mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">It was like a...a <span class="populated place">camp</span>...made a <span class="populated place">camp</span> out of it. </sentence><sentence id="274">People should stay there...send us in there. </sentence><sentence id="275">And this was going on, I think, for a week. </sentence><sentence id="276">Every <span class="dlf">block</span>, every little <span class="populated place">district</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">Then it came to us, finally came to our <span class="region">section</span>, because we looked out the <span class="dlf">windows</span> we see what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="278">They were shooting and killing. </sentence><sentence id="279">Anybody who walked the wrong way was shot. </sentence><sentence id="280">So when it came to us, we lived in a certain <span class="region">section</span>, so we decided we go up to the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and break through the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">Maybe we'll go to the next  <span class="dlf">block</span>, so we'll be able to survive another week. </sentence><sentence id="282">Maybe they'll change their mind and they would ship us out anymore. </sentence><sentence id="283">So we went to the...uh... about two <span class="building">houses</span> away and we stood there. </sentence><sentence id="284">We laid in the...the <span class="interior space">yards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">Finally, they took us too. </sentence><sentence id="286">They had enough <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span> and <span class="spatial object">box cars</span>, so they decided they make a selection and clean out the rest of the <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">When they cleaned...so we were standing in that <span class="dlf">yard</span>, my brothers were still there. </sentence><sentence id="288">Not everybody, the older brother with his child was shipped out a day before because he lived in another <span class="region">section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">And when they came to our <span class="dlf">block</span> and came into the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, they start looking around, they see too many people because people came from other <span class="building">buildings</span> so they figured they'd scare and they start shooting. </sentence><sentence id="290">They saw my brother, so they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="291">They chased him and shot him by a <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And...uh...and then they made a selection and when to...and I was picked to remain in the...in these <span class="populated place">camps</span>...these what you call...they were big <span class="building">industry building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">And they figured they'd stuff us in there meanwhile. </sentence><sentence id="294">So I was stuffed in in that <span class="building">building</span> with my other brothers and we stood there for a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="295">Then they decided they still have too many people. </sentence><sentence id="296">They had a little idea. </sentence><sentence id="297">They had another <span class="building">metal plant</span> there called <span class="building">Metalubia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">That was a...a <span class="building">metal plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="299">They decided...they must have had 10,000 Jews or more, so they decide they open the <span class="dlf">gates</span> and the same guy stood with his cronies and start picking. </sentence><sentence id="300">And when I marched through he decided to ship me the wrong way, so I didn't...I had no...I had no idea what's going to be, but I followed. </sentence><sentence id="301">If 1 don't follow, I get blown away, so I walked a couple of feet, maybe 50 feet and I lined up with the...with the people. </sentence><sentence id="302">I seen the element which was picked out. </sentence><sentence id="303">So I knew I'm...I'm...I'm in bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="304">I'm going with the wrong people. </sentence><sentence id="305">Picked out some old people, some people couldn't walk; some people walked with a crutch. </sentence><sentence id="306">You know, they wanted pure...what you call, a guy who is working, a guy who wore glasses wasn't a candidate to remain either. </sentence><sentence id="307">You had to be...look like almost everybody looked. </sentence><sentence id="308">You couldn't look any different. </sentence><sentence id="309">Okay, so I was picked. </sentence><sentence id="310">And then the Gestapo was marching us down to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">There were a <span class="building">freight railroad station</span>, not the main <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">We're marching down; everybody carried their pieces of luggage they had, and they...some of them couldn't carry so the...the SS were whipping them on the way when they carry, so they dropped the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> and some other people which lived picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="313">Some Polish people jumped out and picked up the <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="314">They figured get ahold okay. </sentence><sentence id="315">When we came down to the...a...to the <span class="dlf">railroad</span>, they were stuffing people into the <span class="spatial object">box cars</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="316">And I seen I be next so I moved back a little. </sentence><sentence id="317">I figured if I move back maybe I'll still have a chance to remain, or if they haven't got no more <span class="spatial object">box cars</span>, maybe they ship me back to the...to this...uh...what you call <span class="building">Metalulia</span>, that <span class="building">steel mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="318">Unfortunate, I waited too long. </sentence><sentence id="319">They brought a <span class="building">hospital</span> with the incurables, and put every body in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">And me put in there too. </sentence><sentence id="321">Most of them what they brought down were almost half dead. </sentence><sentence id="322">They had...they had typhus and all kind of diseases you could think. </sentence><sentence id="323">They stuffed me in there. </sentence><sentence id="324">I couldn't breath because they had these medications on them. </sentence><sentence id="325">I was a short fellow. </sentence><sentence id="326">I wasn't tall then. </sentence><sentence id="327">And I couldn't reach the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">You know, eventually I got stuck by a <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">The <span class="dlf">window</span> was covered with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">You couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="331">So first day I couldn't reach. </sentence><sentence id="332">The second day I reached already, because there were so many dead bodies laying, so I stepped on one or two and I reached the <span class="dlf">window</span> and looked out. </sentence><sentence id="333">Looked out, I see the <span class="spatial object">train</span> keeps puffing; <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span> keeps going and puffing and puffing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="334">Some people say well, maybe we're going to a...to a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, maybe we're going here. </sentence><sentence id="335">You know, you always have hope. </sentence><sentence id="336">You can't say for sure...you know, a person lays in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and he  says you...he has no chance. </sentence><sentence id="337">Eventually some of them come out of too. </sentence><sentence id="338">And we puffed...I think the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going for 2 days or 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="339">I would say most of them died in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">They couldn't survived. </sentence><sentence id="341">And...and when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> arrived in the morning 3 days later, we were going up <span class="region">north</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">We going towards...towards ...uh... <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">I don't know if I ever came into <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">Maybe we went. </sentence><sentence id="345">Our destination was <span class="populated place">Malking</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">Was a <span class="dlf">junction</span> up <span class="region">north</span> near...pass <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">We got there and...uh...we were all, like I said, there was nothing...just laying with dead bodies and the stench was unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="348">When we got to <span class="populated place">Malking</span>...uh...L...1 looked out the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">I see the sun shining; beautiful weather; <span class="env feature">trees</span> growing, but nothing for us. ( </sentence><sentence id="350">crying) Took a half hour. </sentence><sentence id="351">They disconnected the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, what they did. </sentence><sentence id="352">Had a...<span class="populated place">Malking</span> was a <span class="dlf">junction</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353"><span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> was going back <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="354">I was coming from south, but was south...southeast. </sentence><sentence id="355">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> couldn't come in to...to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356"><span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> had a...a <span class="dlf">platform</span> for four, five...four, five...uh...uh...<span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">So they disconnected and start pushing back. </sentence><sentence id="358">I looked out the <span class="dlf">window</span>, and I...I didn't know where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="359">Finally, they pushed, pushed very slow the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> was moving slow, and they pushed me into...to this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, was a <span class="populated place">death camp</span>...pushed me in and I looked out. </sentence><sentence id="361">I seen Gestapo guards, dogs and guys with whips and waiting and they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and start whipping and hitting people over the head and...and the dead bodies remained. </sentence><sentence id="362">And...uh...what happened so...I was out too, and pushed me into a little... like a little <span class="dlf">court yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">The <span class="dlf">court yard</span> was a place where everybody got us and they told us to get undressed, you know. </sentence><sentence id="364">Man, ladies, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="365">Had some neighbors, very distinguished people. </sentence><sentence id="366">Her father owned a <span class="building">drug store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="367">I remember she stood with a kid there and she walked over to the <span class="building">SS</span>, and wanted to ask him, so he whipped her so hard with that whip and then he dropped her on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">I don't what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="369">What happened there, she died...she died any how. </sentence><sentence id="370">So what happened? </sentence><sentence id="371">Then they start picking. </sentence><sentence id="372">What happened in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>, there were at least 900 or a thousand prisoners which were...didn't have more than that. </sentence><sentence id="373">So they needed...because they were killing people like flies so the...the quota was low, so one of the Gestapo decided to pick couple of people. </sentence><sentence id="374">I think he picked maybe 10 or 12. </sentence><sentence id="375">And I was half undressed. </sentence><sentence id="376">So I see he's picking so I jumped into the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">And then we marched away. </sentence><sentence id="378">We marched out to the main...main <span class="dlf">lot</span> where people were dropping clothes. </sentence><sentence id="379">I dropped...I walked out there and he checked me and looked over and looked in. </sentence><sentence id="380">I'm fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="381">I don't why he didn't kill me immediately because I was half undressed. </sentence><sentence id="382">And then what happened...uh...decided there was coffee break or lunch so everybody marched towards the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> because it was around maybe 12:00, 1:00. </sentence><sentence id="383">So, I marched towards the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, got ahold of a couple rag shirts laying all over, shoes, and...uh...I was safe then. </sentence><sentence id="384">And the rest of them were send into that <span class="interior space">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">From that <span class="dlf">yard</span>, they got undressed and marched into the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">You heard screaming fill the <span class="env feature">skies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="387">You see mothers with little children on...on the <span class="spatial object">arms</span> walking, you know, screaming and using these...uh... religious like some people are gentile got...when he get's hit, he says, "Jesus Christ." </sentence><sentence id="388">And a Jew gets hit he says .So that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="389">They were marching in and when they marched in, they closed the <span class="dlf">door</span> and the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and you heard screaming like people choking to death and a couple of minutes quiet down and that was going on every day I was there. </sentence><sentence id="390">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="391">Was going on, and my job was the next...uh...in the afternoon, my job was on the...on the main <span class="dlf">lot</span> to separate clothes. </sentence><sentence id="392">Uh...Let's say shoes to shoes, wool to wool. </sentence><sentence id="393">And after that, a day later, they decided the people which are coming into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, they should sep...they should get their  clothes...the shoes separate and the clothes separate. </sentence><sentence id="394">When they came out to the <span class="dlf">lot</span> they dropped every piece of clothes on a different...different <span class="spatial object">pile</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">The <span class="dlf">piles</span> were high. </sentence><sentence id="396">I would say 3, 4 stories high on top. </sentence><sentence id="397">There were shoes. </sentence><sentence id="398">Millions, thousands of shoes, thousands of clothes, thousands of...uh...luggages and...and there were big metal boxes standing there and everybody had to throw in if he had some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="399">Now everybody, you know, in the old <span class="country">country</span>, you know, like in this <span class="country">country</span>, people have property. </sentence><sentence id="400">Some cherish certain things. </sentence><sentence id="401">In the old <span class="country">country</span>, if you had a little old ring or a gold watch that was...you...you were cherishing. </sentence><sentence id="402">So eventually these <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> used to fill up very fast. </sentence><sentence id="403">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="404">And they walked in there and they died. </sentence><sentence id="405">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="406">This was going on every day. </sentence><sentence id="407">Every day. </sentence><sentence id="408">And so...and I really didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="409">I thought, as I was taught in <span class="building">school</span>, that if you go to Heaven or Hell. </sentence><sentence id="410">So I thought that maybe I did something wrong as a young kid. </sentence><sentence id="411">You know, you believe in religion because, you know, if a rabbi or anybody else tells you that you...you have to believe in God, so I thought I went to Hell, because I couldn't believe what I see. </sentence><sentence id="412">Thousands of people were coming every day. </sentence><sentence id="413">And a hour later, puff. </sentence><sentence id="414">Fired. </sentence><sentence id="415">People were coming from <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>, from <span class="country">Belgium</span>, from <span class="country">Holland</span>, from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">The Polish Jews were coming in <span class="spatial object">cattle trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="417">The Jews from the...from the <span class="region">West</span>, these...these people didn't know much where they're going because they lived in better <span class="region">environment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">They were more intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="419">They didn't believe that...uh... something like this could happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="420">So they came with...some of them came with the maids taking care, and they all just marched in. </sentence><sentence id="421">They gave them...some of them gave a piece of soap, make believe they take a <span class="interior space">shower</span> and marched in, and that's...that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="422">And we lived in the...there were three <span class="building">barracks</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="423">Was <span class="building">barrack 1</span>, 2 and 3. </sentence><sentence id="424">There were two original. </sentence><sentence id="425">One with...at night when we marched into the <span class="building">barracks</span>, we were marched in, and the <span class="building">barracks</span> was unbearable because people were making on their <span class="spatial object">blankets</span>, but you couldn't walk out. </sentence><sentence id="426">There was no such a thing as a...a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> or anything, so people were making on top of it because if you stuck your head out, you got blown away. </sentence><sentence id="427">And...uh...so we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="428">And at night some people committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="429">They couldn't take it, you know, because they knew that...uh...they survived and their children and their wives are dead. </sentence><sentence id="430">And...and that's all what was going in these...in these <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">Every morning we marched out. </sentence><sentence id="432">But what happened at...going back to the...to where the...uh...when people came were from the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, they...uh...some people got lost. </sentence><sentence id="433">Some children got lost or some crippled people came which couldn't march into the...to that <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, so they picked them up on a little... like a little <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span>, you know, piece of wood, and they brought them in...they called it a <span class="building">hospital</span>, <span class="building">Lazarette</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">Had a sign <span class="building">Lazarette</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">What was this <span class="building">Lazarette</span>, was a...a <span class="dlf">ditch</span>, the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and two or three people stood there and...and the SS took the guy over or anybody else and he brought him in, he shot him, and then they burned him. </sentence><sentence id="436">They put some chemicals on, they burned him. </sentence><sentence id="437">And that was...the smell was horrocious, impossible. </sentence><sentence id="438">Sometimes, some children got lost. </sentence><sentence id="439">Little kids, 2 years old, l year old, they got lost. </sentence><sentence id="440">So brought them in there and burned them to death because they were...were too much of a deed to bring them there because by the time you bring him there, they're not going to waste any time. </sentence><sentence id="441">So that's what it was, so I was there for...for 11 days, struggling every day, seeing killing and hanging. </sentence><sentence id="442">And they were whipping people. </sentence><sentence id="443">If they got ahold of somebody he...I don't know, he did something wrong and maybe he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="444">They got ahold of him. </sentence><sentence id="445">They whipped him. </sentence><sentence id="446">When they whipped him, you couldn't recognize the color of his skin. </sentence><sentence id="447">And then they hanged him by his legs. </sentence><sentence id="448">Was hanging for 40 minutes, and he was  dead. </sentence><sentence id="449">This was going on every day. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then they had...uh...prepared another <span class="building">barrack</span>, <span class="building">barrack 3</span>, by the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="451">And then there were rumors when this <span class="building">barrack</span> was ready, they shipped me into this <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452"><span class="building">Barrack</span> was a little better, what do you call, cleaner for the first...uh...couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="453">But there were rumors that this <span class="building">barrack</span> is going to be liquidated because these are people...so I figured the only way to do is to plan an escape. </sentence><sentence id="454">So L..I planned with another friend. </sentence><sentence id="455">Then I got ahold of another friend, people which I went to <span class="building">school</span> with. </sentence><sentence id="456">But...uh...there were other peoples which wanted to escape too. </sentence><sentence id="457">Kids which I knew from...I lived with them on the <span class="dlf">block</span>, but some of them were sort of...I couldn't trust. </sentence><sentence id="458">What do you mean by trust? </sentence><sentence id="459">They weren't...they weren't enough...uh...reliable. </sentence><sentence id="460">You know, they are kids sometimes 10, 12 years which are very reliable people, and some kids are kids. </sentence><sentence id="461">So I left him back. </sentence><sentence id="462">I...before I escaped he had a brother working with him. </sentence><sentence id="463">His brother got shot. </sentence><sentence id="464">He was a good looking guy. </sentence><sentence id="465">He looked too good, so maybe they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="466">So he was left alone, and he was crying to me. </sentence><sentence id="467">He had trouble with his toes. </sentence><sentence id="468">He had ingrown toe nails, the kid, my neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="469">So he was telling me, if you plan anything, take me with you. </sentence><sentence id="470">So I figured dead or alive, it's no time to play games here. </sentence><sentence id="471">So I got...I got these two other fellows and we planned to escape. </sentence><sentence id="472">We says we're going to escape at night because when we by the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and drinking coffee, you know, and we start walking a little away. </sentence><sentence id="473">If any...worse comes to worse, they get ahold of us while we're walking too far, we can get a beating. </sentence><sentence id="474">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="475">Because they wouldn't bother opening the <span class="building">factory</span> for...for killing. </sentence><sentence id="476">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first." </sentence><sentence id="477">And before we escaped, I compared myself. </sentence><sentence id="478">I knew if survive it was good to have sugar, and there was plenty food laying which people brought. </sentence><sentence id="479">They thought they're going to a picnic. </sentence><sentence id="480">So I... got ahold of a bag...uh...a bag of sugar with a rope and I put it on my neck, so in case I starve sugar would keep me going. </sentence><sentence id="481">And the other fellows had other stuff. </sentence><sentence id="482">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first. </sentence><sentence id="483">You go first. </sentence><sentence id="484">Time is late. </sentence><sentence id="485">You go first." </sentence><sentence id="486">So I figured, "Okay, I go first." </sentence><sentence id="487">I went first and I ran into the...uh..behind a...a little...small little <span class="dlf">pool</span> where they were having chickens there. </sentence><sentence id="488">Chickens and goose were swimming. </sentence><sentence id="489">I was working there too. </sentence><sentence id="490">So I ran in and I'm waiting. </sentence><sentence id="491">Finally, another fellow comes. </sentence><sentence id="492">My friend comes. </sentence><sentence id="493">He ran so fast I ripped his sleeve off on his jacket. </sentence><sentence id="494">I never seen him. </sentence><sentence id="495">When the third one came he ran so fast, but him...I eventually got a hold of. </sentence><sentence id="496">And we were both stuck in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="497">We knew that the...the...uh...the...uh...<span class="building">towers</span> where they were watching, they're going off 9 o'clock, because if they're pushing you into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and they stay on top with the machine guns, one <span class="building">barrack</span> facing the other, if anybody walks out, so what's the use to...to watch the <span class="building">towers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="498">So we waited. </sentence><sentence id="499">And had...had a <span class="spatial object">plier</span> in my pocket to cut the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">And we waited. </sentence><sentence id="501">Was 9 already, later. </sentence><sentence id="502">Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="503">So we moved towards the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="504">I moved towards the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="505">And the guy on...on the <span class="building">tower</span> was sitting up there. </sentence><sentence id="506">I don't know if he saw me, if he didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="507">I can't explain. </sentence><sentence id="508">His machine gun was just moving back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="509">We cut the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">We went through the <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="511">He went through. </sentence><sentence id="512">Before we cut the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, we were walking like the army on our hands and feet because you couldn't stand up or cut the <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="513">Went through the <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="514">And we ran out, and then we start running and running and running. </sentence><sentence id="515">We didn't know where to run. </sentence><sentence id="516">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="517">So we ran almost a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="518">And we said, "If we're going to run, if we want to rest we should at least rest in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>." </sentence><sentence id="519">Unfortunately, we ran so long that we landed up in <span class="env feature">land</span>, just big <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="520">So we landed and we couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="521">So we sit down. </sentence><sentence id="522">And heavy storm came and soaked us through for hours. </sentence><sentence id="523">And we were sitting both holding on to each other. </sentence><sentence id="524">And in the morning around 5  o'clock, we started looking around. </sentence><sentence id="525">We seen a little <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="526">A lady walks out from the <span class="building">house</span> and she's trying to open her <span class="dlf">shutters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="527">So I figured I'll walk over to her. </sentence><sentence id="528">So when I walked over, she knew already who I am because they knew. </sentence><sentence id="529">She says, "You must have been one from the escapees from here. </sentence><sentence id="530">You better walk away because the <span class="spatial object">SS</span> is coming through here, hundreds of <span class="spatial object">cars</span> going to the farmers to pick up milk and eggs for the...for their food." </sentence><sentence id="531">So we was standing in...the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and waited. </sentence><sentence id="532">She says, "You better leave." </sentence><sentence id="533">She says, "Go a little further down." </sentence><sentence id="534">So went a little further down, and then we met somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="535">Somebody got a hold of us and he says to us, "You know, I could save your life and I could do this for you and other things for you if you have any money." </sentence><sentence id="536">I had some money. </sentence><sentence id="537">I had some Polish money. </sentence><sentence id="538">So we gave him...he says he's going to go to get us some bread and he could do a lot for us. </sentence><sentence id="539">So we gave him some money. </sentence><sentence id="540">He left. </sentence><sentence id="541">When he left, we left because we knew what happened because the Gestapo's gave orders, "if you bring a Jew, you get a pound of sugar." </sentence><sentence id="542">And if he has good shoes, you could take his shoes too." </sentence><sentence id="543">That was the price the Germans gave to the Polish people, but he didn't get a hold of me. </sentence><sentence id="544">He took off, and we...we marched. </sentence><sentence id="545">We marched another couple of miles. </sentence><sentence id="546">I got a hold of a...walked into a <span class="building">farmer's house</span> and the woman was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="547">She came out and walked with me and my friend almost for an hour, showed us to go to another <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">Closed <span class="dlf">road</span> where the police is not there. </sentence><sentence id="549">She was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="550">She came with a little baby on her back and walked and then she left us and she...she made a prayer, you know. </sentence><sentence id="551">You know, she took her cross out and made a prayer, God should be with you. </sentence><sentence id="552">And we went our way. </sentence><sentence id="553">Then we walked another, I think, a mile or two, walked into another <span class="building">farm house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="554">We told the farmer we want to go to...to a <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">He says he's going to take us, but he's not going to walk with us...distance away. </sentence><sentence id="556">And he opened a <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="557">He says, "In case the SS comes, you just walked in yourself. </sentence><sentence id="558">I had nothing to do." </sentence><sentence id="559">So he...uh...he walked with us. </sentence><sentence id="560">This man walked so fast that you had no idea, so fast. </sentence><sentence id="561">And we followed him. </sentence><sentence id="562">Finally, we came to a small little <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="563">The <span class="populated place">village</span> name was <span class="populated place">Soldavna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">Little <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">And he says, "Okay, you're on your own." </sentence><sentence id="566">I says, "No, we're not going to give you the money til you buy us tickets." </sentence><sentence id="567">He got made and bought us tickets. </sentence><sentence id="568">Went into the...went into the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and we sat there. </sentence><sentence id="569"><span class="spatial object">Train</span> was crowded. </sentence><sentence id="570">People were going from the <span class="populated place">village</span> to buy some food. </sentence><sentence id="571">And I been in that <span class="spatial object">train</span> for...overnight. </sentence><sentence id="572">In the morning, someone recognized me. </sentence><sentence id="573">He must have been some...he says, "There's a Jew in the <span class="spatial object">subway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="574">There's a Jew in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="575">And he caused a riot. </sentence><sentence id="576">And he says, "I'm going to get you and I'm going to get to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="577">I can get a pound of sugar ad I can get your shoes." </sentence><sentence id="578">So what happened, most of the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> when they come into <span class="populated place">town</span>, they...they...they turn into <span class="populated place">town</span> and they have to slow down because there...there's like a <span class="dlf">curve</span> and they slow down. </sentence><sentence id="579">When the <span class="spatial object">train</span> slowed down, I jumped out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> with my friend because I didn't get to the main <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="580">I figured if 1 get to the main <span class="building">railroad station</span>, I'd be a dead duck because there's police and Gestapo and all this. </sentence><sentence id="581">I got up and the other guy jumped off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and then we walked up the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="582">Got a hold of somebody else and he said he's going to take us <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">His father's a shoemaker and he's going to keep us, and we told him we want to go further. </sentence><sentence id="584">We want to go from the...from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> because when we jumped off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was outskirts of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>...says we want to go to....uh...to <span class="populated place">Czestachowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="585">He says, "Well, you could sleep over my <span class="building">house</span> and tomorrow I'll take you down to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="586">Came into his <span class="building">house</span>, me and my friend. </sentence><sentence id="587">We laid down on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">We slept for 2 days. </sentence><sentence id="589">Then we got up, everything was empty. </sentence><sentence id="590">Anything we had in our <span class="spatial object">pockets</span>, he took out. </sentence><sentence id="591">He left us not even with  0 a cent. </sentence><sentence id="592">And if you haven't got money where can you go? </sentence><sentence id="593">So we told him, "Look, if you give us some money back, keep some of it. </sentence><sentence id="594">If not, we'll blow the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="595">We're not afraid." </sentence><sentence id="596">We're not afraid to die because we knew we're going to die anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="597">So he decided to give us some. </sentence><sentence id="598">And then at night he took us down to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we went towards <span class="populated place">Czectachowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">Same thing in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">Much didn't happen because we're quiet. </sentence><sentence id="601"><span class="spatial object">Train</span> was crowded. </sentence><sentence id="602">When we reached <span class="populated place">Czestachowa</span>, the destination...I knew the <span class="populated place">town</span> well. </sentence><sentence id="603">I lived there. </sentence><sentence id="604">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> slowed down on a <span class="dlf">curve</span> into the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="605">We jumped out, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="606">We got ahold of another...somehow, she walks in. </sentence><sentence id="607">She says, "Well, if you want, you could stay here. </sentence><sentence id="608">But I put you in in the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="609">If someone gets a hold of you, I have no part of it." </sentence><sentence id="610">She let us sleep over. </sentence><sentence id="611">The next day she chased us out. </sentence><sentence id="612">So my friend says that, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="613">I have friends here. </sentence><sentence id="614">Gentile friends which my father used to do business with, so maybe they could hide me out and until the war is over." </sentence><sentence id="615">So I says, "I have some too." </sentence><sentence id="616">So L..he went with me. </sentence><sentence id="617">I walked over there and there was a <span class="building">store</span>, a <span class="building">bicycle store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="618">I walked in and his wife saw me. </sentence><sentence id="619">His wife knew me, and he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="620">There were customers in there. </sentence><sentence id="621">And he was winking with his eyes I shouldn't say nothing. </sentence><sentence id="622">And meanwhile he...my friend...was outside in the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">You know...uh... a <span class="interior space">country bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">I have to tell you, a <span class="spatial object">board</span> in a <span class="dlf">hole</span>, and he was sitting in there because he couldn't stay outside. </sentence><sentence id="625">He says, "I'll wait for you." </sentence><sentence id="626">Spoke to my old friend and he's telling me, he says, "Look, I can do anything for you in money, but I can't help you hiding. </sentence><sentence id="627">I wouldn't because I could lose my life." </sentence><sentence id="628">I says, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="629">So I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="630">I walked toward the...uh...<span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">He wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="632">He took off. </sentence><sentence id="633">He decided maybe he do better on his own than with me. </sentence><sentence id="634">So I was left all alone, you know. </sentence><sentence id="635">I knew the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">I didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="637">I marched the <span class="populated place">town</span>, marched up, sideways, all over. </sentence><sentence id="638">How much can you walk? </sentence><sentence id="639">You know, you're in danger because, you know, you get picked up, you're dead. </sentence><sentence id="640">So I decided maybe I should...I knew I had a brother working in a...in a...in a...in a <span class="building">steel mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="641">He was...he was living there because when the war...when they made a selection, they decided that...uh...they wanted good people. </sentence><sentence id="642">They figured if they send him into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they'd never see him, so he remained there. </sentence><sentence id="643">And they slept there. </sentence><sentence id="644">They had a couple of <span class="building">barracks</span> they slept in. </sentence><sentence id="645">So I decided, "let me go down there." </sentence><sentence id="646">I went down there and stood outside. </sentence><sentence id="647">I seen a horse with a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> turned over right near the <span class="building">plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="648">So I walked over to the guy. </sentence><sentence id="649">I asked him if he knows if any Jews live here. </sentence><sentence id="650">He says, "Yal, there's some over there working." </sentence><sentence id="651">I says, "Can you call out a guy by that name, "Martin ." </sentence><sentence id="652">He says, "I go in." </sentence><sentence id="653">He went in. </sentence><sentence id="654">Took a couple of minutes. </sentence><sentence id="655">He walked out. </sentence><sentence id="656">He saw me. </sentence><sentence id="657">He didn't know what hit him. </sentence><sentence id="658">Where did I come from? </sentence><sentence id="659">What come? </sentence><sentence id="660">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="661">Where's this one? </sentence><sentence id="662">Where's the other one? </sentence><sentence id="663">And, you know, he took me into the <span class="building">barracks</span> and I explained it to him exact what happened. </sentence><sentence id="664">It's unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="665">He didn't believe. </sentence><sentence id="666">And then what they did, they put me up in the <span class="building">barracks</span> in the <span class="building">commer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">They were hiding me. </sentence><sentence id="668">What to do with me? </sentence><sentence id="669">Because they didn't know what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="670">My brother figured he could remain there, but you couldn't report to the police that somebody else came in. </sentence><sentence id="671">Okay, it came at night...people came back from the shift and it's like...uh...they start asking. </sentence><sentence id="672">You know, it's somebody came in. </sentence><sentence id="673">After all they were for...for...a couple of weeks along, they didn't know what happened to their wife and children, so they started asking where I come from. </sentence><sentence id="674">What it is? </sentence><sentence id="675">So I didn't want to talk. </sentence><sentence id="676">Finally, they forced me to say where I come from so I told them exact what happened to their wives and children. </sentence><sentence id="677">That they're all gassed and died. </sentence><sentence id="678">So then they wanted to kill me because I'm lying. </sentence><sentence id="679">So then they asked my brother if I ever been in a...a emotional sick. </sentence><sentence id="680">They got so  1 furious about it that they squealed on the...squealed the police and if I don't leave, they're gonna report to the police. </sentence><sentence id="681">Middle of the night, it was 12 o'clock at night or 1:00, I was kicked out and finally the police was notified. </sentence><sentence id="682">And they came out, start shooting, but I was sitting in..in the...what you call, in the weeds...the high weeds. </sentence><sentence id="683">The dried up <span class="env feature">weeds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="684">I was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="685">Didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="686">Let them shoot. </sentence><sentence id="687">My life wasn't worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="688">It was just like you take a <span class="spatial object">wastebasket</span>, throw it out. </sentence><sentence id="689">I was waiting to...to die any time. </sentence><sentence id="690">What's the use. </sentence><sentence id="691">I mean it's like you want to dispose of your body. </sentence><sentence id="692">It was too much for you. </sentence><sentence id="693">I sat there and then it quiet down and they started screaming, "Hurray. </sentence><sentence id="694">Hurray. </sentence><sentence id="695">We got him. </sentence><sentence id="696">We got him. </sentence><sentence id="697">We got him." </sentence><sentence id="698">I sat there and then I walked away and knocked at another <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">The guy was making...uh...<span class="spatial object">funeral boxes</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="700">I walked in and he says he can't do nothing for me. </sentence><sentence id="701">The only thing I do is get into the <span class="building">shop</span>, stay there, leave the <span class="dlf">door</span> open. </sentence><sentence id="702">If you're in there, you sneaked in yourself. </sentence><sentence id="703">I stood there in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="704">I had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="705">I decided to go into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="706">To the same <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="707">Came in again. </sentence><sentence id="708">What're you doing? </sentence><sentence id="709">So my brother decided we're both go together to see where we could go. </sentence><sentence id="710">If we work out, we'll work out. </sentence><sentence id="711">If not, we'll both...if we die, we'll both die. </sentence><sentence id="712">So we took a walk in...along side the <span class="env feature">river</span>...was a <span class="env feature">river</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="713">Took a long side. </sentence><sentence id="714">We walked a couple of miles. </sentence><sentence id="715">Saw a little <span class="building">house</span>, little <span class="building">farmer's house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="716">The <span class="building">house</span> must have been maybe 20 by 20. </sentence><sentence id="717">I walked in and the wife wasn't <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="718">He was <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="719">He looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="720">Up and down. </sentence><sentence id="721">I looked like...ever see a little...a little dog is lost and he knocks at somebody's <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">He felt sorry for me and he says he can't do nothing til his wife come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="723">And meanwhile go into the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="724">The same thing. </sentence><sentence id="725">Stay in the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="726">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="727">My brother had to run back to the <span class="building">plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="728">If they see he's not there, if they get ahold of him or they find him out of the <span class="building">plant</span> he gets shot. </sentence><sentence id="729">So he was...he left and then his wife came <span class="building">home</span> and she fell in love with me and she says, "Yal, we're gonna keep him." </sentence><sentence id="730">And I was there...the first day I was very useful. </sentence><sentence id="731">I used to clean the cows, clean the <span class="building">barn</span>, wash clothes for them. </sentence><sentence id="732">And that's what I did for almost a whole month. </sentence><sentence id="733">And they got so used to me that they didn't want me to leave. </sentence><sentence id="734">Mine clothes I used to wash. </sentence><sentence id="735">I used to get insects in my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="736">They had a small place. </sentence><sentence id="737">So I used to take my clothes and put it to the <span class="env feature">river</span> and put a <span class="env feature">rock</span> over it, so the...the <span class="env feature">water</span> was floating down the <span class="env feature">river</span>, took all the insects out. </sentence><sentence id="738">And I lived there for a month, you know, every night, you know, they were used to me. __ </sentence><sentence id="739">and taking care of all the things. </sentence><sentence id="740">And then my brother came once and he says, "They're forming another little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>." </sentence><sentence id="741">Because from the 39,000 everybody was liquidated, and there wasn't much left. </sentence><sentence id="742">And they didn't want the Jews to live in the <span class="building">plant</span> because they were shabby <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="743">Decided to take the old <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span> and close in the <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="744">The <span class="dlf">blocks</span> must have been what?...500 or thousand feet a <span class="dlf">block</span>, close in the sides, so they closed up three <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, four <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="745">And...and these people which lived in the...uh...<span class="env feature">plants</span>...they had some people coming down. </sentence><sentence id="746">Let's say you picked out...Let's say 5,000 people in a <span class="building">plant</span>, they picked out a hundred and they gave them a certain <span class="region">section</span>, and they said, "You make <span class="interior space">room</span> for you people which come in." </sentence><sentence id="747">So...so they organized a little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="748">A small, little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">And I found out, so I says, "I'm going to go into the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="750">So when that <span class="building">plant</span> was marching in, a day shift...it was a day shift and night shift. </sentence><sentence id="751">So my brother says you stay aside of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="752">When you're marching in, you jump into the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="753">That's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="754">I waited. </sentence><sentence id="755">The man in charge, the German policeman was an old man. </sentence><sentence id="756">He rode on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">He couldn't tell the difference from this one or the other one. </sentence><sentence id="758">Marched into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and...uh...met my brother and...uh...met my brother there and my mother was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="759">My moth...my mother was  2 hiding in a <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, you know, who had...who had build a <span class="interior space">basement</span> and we ripped out the <span class="dlf">door</span> and we glued up the <span class="dlf">door</span> with bricks. </sentence><sentence id="760">It looked the same so you couldn't tell she was there. </sentence><sentence id="761">She was hiding there for 4, 5 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="762">Finally, they couldn't take it any more. </sentence><sentence id="763">There were children in there too. </sentence><sentence id="764">And the childrens were crying and someone heard the kids crying and they knew they're people hiding. </sentence><sentence id="765">So they opened the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="766">The shot more...half of the people were shot. </sentence><sentence id="767">My mother sort of survived with my...my sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="768">And...uh...they brought in there...they remained in the little...the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">They stood in the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> over there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="770">And what happened with me is I marched into the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I met them. </sentence><sentence id="771">My mother was still there and my sister-in-law was there with the little kids. </sentence><sentence id="772">And every day what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="773">Killing. </sentence><sentence id="774">Shoot a hundred. </sentence><sentence id="775">Shoot 2 hundred. </sentence><sentence id="776">One day they came and said...uh...we want all the...uh...intelligent people which was left. </sentence><sentence id="777">We have an order from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778"><span class="country">England</span> sent us a...a <span class="spatial object">cable</span> that we want all these intelligent Jews to go...to <span class="country">Palestine</span> or...<span class="country">Palestine</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="779">So people were...figured they'd take any opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="780">So they loaded up about 5, 6 <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> with 5, 6 hundred people and they took them down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and they threw in and shot them in a <span class="dlf">common grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="781">That was the end of these. </sentence><sentence id="782">That's was going on. </sentence><sentence id="783">And then we lived in the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in fear every day. </sentence><sentence id="784">One day I had a friend who just came from the same <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="785">He got a hold of a gun. </sentence><sentence id="786">He bought a gun because he figured he couldn't take it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="787">If he has to die, he's going to take some...some Germans with him. </sentence><sentence id="788">So one day they picked him up and...uh...you know, they always looked to...anybody looks suspicious...you walked the wrong way, you were shot. </sentence><sentence id="789">So one day, he walked and they had a little...a little <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="790">A little small <span class="building">butcher shop</span> by the <span class="building">police station</span> in the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where anybody was suspicious was thrown in there. </sentence><sentence id="791">And then...uh...if they were in a good mood, they let you go. </sentence><sentence id="792">If not, they shot you in the back. </sentence><sentence id="793">There was a...a place where the people used to keep ice, you know. </sentence><sentence id="794">Here they have <span class="spatial object">refrigeration</span>. </sentence><sentence id="795">Then they used to go...in the winter used to go to the <span class="env feature">river</span> and chop the ice and put it into that <span class="building">warehouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="796">So used to shot into. </sentence><sentence id="797">So...so one day, he had a gun on him. </sentence><sentence id="798">He had bought a gun. </sentence><sentence id="799">So when they took him out and they start shooting people in this...this little <span class="building">market</span>, he pulled his gun out and wanted to shoot this German guy but unfortunate, his gun was so old, rusty, that it didn't fire. </sentence><sentence id="800">So what he did...he couldn't shoot him so he jumped on him and bit his throat. </sentence><sentence id="801">And meanwhile the other SS saw what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="802">They shot him. </sentence><sentence id="803">Then they decided...what happened every 10s going to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="804">So they took people out. </sentence><sentence id="805">I know there were a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="806">And every 10 was shot and brought in the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="807">No, they brought the bodies into the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="808">There is a big <span class="dlf">yard</span>, and everybody had to go and see, and they were laying there. </sentence><sentence id="809">That's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="810">And then this was going on, I think, for a year. </sentence><sentence id="811">Was miserable living this little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="812">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="813">We were buying sometimes outside anything we got a hold of. </sentence><sentence id="814">Horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="815">Anything! </sentence><sentence id="816">Disease. </sentence><sentence id="817">Disease. </sentence><sentence id="818">The place was diseased. </sentence><sentence id="819">Was filthy. </sentence><sentence id="820">People were stuffed in in places, you know, so then what happened they decided they're going to liquidate that little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="821">There were I think 6,500 Jews lived in that little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="822">What do you do with my mother? </sentence><sentence id="823">My mother couldn't walk out and...and face the music because she looked old. </sentence><sentence id="824">She wasn't old, but she didn't look young enough to be that, so we decided we're going to put her in in a <span class="interior space">attic</span>, a little <span class="interior space">attic</span> over the <span class="dlf">court yard</span>, a little <span class="interior space">attic</span> and my sister-in-law with the kid. </sentence><sentence id="825">And this was going on for the time we were in the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="826">They were looking for old people and children, so we made a false <span class="dlf">door</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="827">It was dark, <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, old shabby <span class="building">house</span> so we...we...we...uh...made a double  <span class="dlf">3 door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="828">Nobody knew, but somebody...there's always trouble-makers. </sentence><sentence id="829">And there were people which were sympathizing with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="830">They figured they survive. </sentence><sentence id="831">So one guy came and he said, "This is not...this is a false <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="832">There's somebody in there." </sentence><sentence id="833">So he...the Gestapo said, "No, that's no

</sentence><sentence id="837">And my sister-in-law was in there, and the little child was in there. </sentence><sentence id="838">But that little child was so sharp, each time he heard noise he jumped into a big <span class="spatial object">pot</span> and put a cover over it so nobody knew he was there. </sentence><sentence id="839">He survived. </sentence><sentence id="840">My mother survived. </sentence><sentence id="841">When they came in...the police came in...there was some Jewish police came with them. </sentence><sentence id="842">And the Jewish police knew my brothers, so they start screaming, "Where's the old lady? </sentence><sentence id="843">Where's the old lady?" </sentence><sentence id="844">So I says, "Aw, you got the wrong information." </sentence><sentence id="845">He walked out. </sentence><sentence id="846">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="847">And this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="848">And then there was no more hiding. </sentence><sentence id="849">Nothing to hide. </sentence><sentence id="850">So we formed ourself over the <span class="dlf">court yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">It was like a little <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="852">There was a little... like a little small <span class="building">house</span>, and the <span class="building">house</span> had an <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">So we figured if they'd be a selection or liquidation, we knew the liquidation is coming. </sentence><sentence id="854">This is not going to be forever. </sentence><sentence id="855">A matter of time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="856">So we decided we're going to put them up there. </sentence><sentence id="857">Anytime we went to work in the <span class="interior space">moming</span> we marched out because we used to march out like we used to shape up. </sentence><sentence id="858">We had <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="859">What do you mean a <span class="spatial object">kapo</span>? </sentence><sentence id="860">A kapo was a foreman. </sentence><sentence id="861">He had his group. </sentence><sentence id="862">500 men. </sentence><sentence id="863">200 men. </sentence><sentence id="864">When we marched out in the morning, we had to meet in front a big <span class="building">market</span> and the Gestapo checked out how many you got? </sentence><sentence id="865">How many you got? </sentence><sentence id="866">And we assigned jobs. </sentence><sentence id="867">The jobs were various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="868">Some jobs...mine job was to work on the <span class="dlf">Russian cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="869">The Russian soldiers they captured...the Russian soldiers from the war, so they brought them into <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and never gave them any food. </sentence><sentence id="870">They gave them raw potatoes and they died on dysentery, all kind of diseases. </sentence><sentence id="871">So mine job is to work on the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, dig <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="872">They used to bring truck loads or...or thousands of Russian soldiers and...uh...they used to roll off there...ever see, like you know how you see in the <span class="country">United States</span> when they bring a <span class="spatial object">garbage truck</span> to a <span class="building">dump</span>, the opened the back and out. </sentence><sentence id="873">That's the way they used to roll out and you know, I had...I had feelings all the time to people, any people. </sentence><sentence id="874">I always used to say when I used to stay there with my friends, we used to work. </sentence><sentence id="875">I used to say, "Here, look at this. </sentence><sentence id="876">So many thousands of people laying in this <span class="dlf">hole</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="877">crying) I says, "So many thousands of people laying in this <span class="dlf">hole</span> and a mother...a mother somewhere in <span class="country">Russia</span> is waiting for her son to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="878">And he's dead.: </sentence><sentence id="879">Thousands...thousands of Russian people were waiting for their sons to come <span class="building">home</span> from the war and meanwhile they were laying in that <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="880">Thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="881">And this was going on for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="882">Eventually, they decide to liquidate the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="883">By liquid... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1631"> End of Tape #1  4 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1632">A: So they...uh...before liquidation, they used to come in...Gestapo on Sunday, like the <span class="building">Lufbafer</span>, that was the air force. </sentence><sentence id="1633">They had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1634">They figured let's go down. </sentence><sentence id="1635">We'll make some...make some trouble for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1636">They used to walk in and kill people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Like some people might say today, "They followed orders." </sentence><sentence id="1638">A lot of 50 or 70 percent was no follow orders. </sentence><sentence id="1639">They came in and shoot and kill just for fun. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And did a lot of things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1641">They found a man with a beard. </sentence><sentence id="1642">They burned his beard or they did a lot of crazy things they did. </sentence><sentence id="1643">They used to carry on something. </sentence><sentence id="1644">And that was going on...the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was...each time you marched in at night. </sentence><sentence id="1645">What we used to do, when we walked out to work, at night we used to march in and carry food. </sentence><sentence id="1646">Somebody carried a bag of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1647">One carry a half.a bag of onions, carrots, peas, anything you can get ahold of. </sentence><sentence id="1648">So they used to surprise it. </sentence><sentence id="1649">When we used to march and turn the <span class="dlf">corner</span>, we were a thousand feet away, we saw them standing. </sentence><sentence id="1650">As soon as we saw them standing, we dropped the bags because if you brought in food, you got killed. </sentence><sentence id="1651">So we dropped the bags. </sentence><sentence id="1652">Sometimes they weren't there so we started marching so fast, and the police stood by the guard...the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1653">They said, "Come on. </sentence><sentence id="1654">Move. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Move. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Move." </sentence><sentence id="1657">before they come out. </sentence><sentence id="1658">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="1659">So we were lucky and we brought some stuff in. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Brought in meat. </sentence><sentence id="1661">Who knows? </sentence><sentence id="1662">Dog meat, horse meat, anything you got ahold of. </sentence><sentence id="1663">The horse meat you could tell apart. </sentence><sentence id="1664">It was red. </sentence><sentence id="1665">More red than normal meat. </sentence><sentence id="1666">And this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1667">They used to come in and they used to say...see a mother with a child...uh...with two children. </sentence><sentence id="1668">They used to walk over, "Give me one of your child. </sentence><sentence id="1669">One I want. </sentence><sentence id="1670">Pick which one you want. </sentence><sentence id="1671">If not, you get killed." </sentence><sentence id="1672">So the mother didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1673">What should she do? </sentence><sentence id="1674">How can she give away one? </sentence><sentence id="1675">So he shot them all. </sentence><sentence id="1676">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1677">That was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1678">That's what the German...German...not only the German people. </sentence><sentence id="1679">The German people knew too what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1680">Some people say they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1681">They...they used to smell the odor in...in <span class="populated

brother tells me he was in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, that they used to march. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Thousands of miles they used to march when the Germans...the Russian used to advance, so they didn't want to leave the prisoners. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1685">They used to march. _ </sentence><sentence id="1686">On a march, there used to be, I think, 3, 4 hundred thousand prisoners. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1687">All types. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Not only Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1689">All nationalities used to march.

ran out of food, so they...they killed the horses. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And they ate part of the food, but this was rough in general. </sentence><sentence id="1696">But going back to the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, finally the...the Jews got smart and says, "We're going to try to defend ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1697">What we're going to do, if the Germans come in and start liquidating, we're going to give him a...a little fight. </sentence><sentence id="1698">But what happened the Germans had a lot spies. </sentence><sentence id="1699">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="1700">They had people moved into little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1701">Ifa guy was deaf and <span class="dlf">dump</span>, he wore a yellow band with 3 black marks...markings, 3 black dots, so we know the guy can't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1702">He can't speak. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And the moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And he most have been set up by the...by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And he sort of knew what was going on and meanwhile the Jews in the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> used to make hand grenades. </sentence><sentence id="1706">They used to take aluminum and...and pour it in. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1707">You know, primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And then had a <span class="spatial object">lathe</span> grind it and clean it and cloth it with the dynamite. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And they had this prepared, you know, and we had built a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1710">What we did, we collected <span class="spatial object">pickle barrels</span> and we were digging a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Each time we did a distance, we  5 pushed a <span class="spatial object">barrel</span>, pushed a <span class="spatial object">barrel</span>, not to walk out but to crawl out and this supposed to been...the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>'s supposed to go to the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1712">Eventually, they got all the information what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Got ahold of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Anybody who was in the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> was killed because they put gas in or something. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And anybody who was caught was shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And that was the end of...the...uh...preparation for the...for the battle. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And then they came in and start liquidating the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1718">They took people down. </sentence><sentence id="1719">They took truck loads down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and shot them right in the <span class="dlf">grave</span>, and they...they killed people and people and people. </sentence><sentence id="1720">My mother was hiding in that little <span class="building">house</span> with my sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="1721">They were there quite awhile. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1722">We were trying to make contact with some people which knew...knew a little. </sentence><sentence id="1723">They were closer to the <span class="building">police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Maybe we can get them out or what or when. </sentence><sentence id="1725">But what happened...the Germans, after they cleaned out the little <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they blew every <span class="building">house</span> up. </sentence><sentence id="1726">They were old, little shabby <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1727">You could have pushed them with a...with a strong hand. </sentence><sentence id="1728">So they were blowing up the <span class="building">houses</span>, one <span class="building">house</span> after another cause they didn't want to show it's there. </sentence><sentence id="1729">So when they're blowing up the <span class="building">houses</span>, my mother and my sister-in-law walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1730">They walked out, and Gestapo got ahold of them and put them on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and says, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1731">We'll take you here and there." </sentence><sentence id="1732">My sister-in-law and the kids...took them down to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> and shot them in the same <span class="dlf">grave</span> and that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="1733">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1734">That was the end of my mother ad my sister-in-law and the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And then they decide to put us back in the <span class="building">plants</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Build <span class="building">barracks</span> and put us back in the <span class="building">plants</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1737">The same <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1738">The <span class="building">plant</span> was the <span class="building">Hassack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1739">That was a company...a company from <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Original, we used to make...uh...what you call? </sentence><sentence id="1741">The Germans had no gas so they built like little...little <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> in the back of their <span class="spatial object">truck</span> or back of their <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1742">Used to put in hard wood and close it. </sentence><sentence id="1743">The gas from the <span class="env feature">wood</span> used to push the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1744">We used to do that from the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Then the <span class="building">plant</span> changed. </sentence><sentence id="1746">We start making ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="1747">I was...what happened, the day they liquidate the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I remained in the <span class="building">plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1748">Never went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1749">So I didn't go <span class="building">home</span> and there was no place to sleep, so we slept on the cement. </sentence><sentence id="1750">The hardest thing was to sleep on the cement. </sentence><sentence id="1751">You know, you couldn't...you turned and twist...there's nothing...the only thing you did to put your hand to your elbow on top under your head. </sentence><sentence id="1752">And each time they came in, they shoot...they were shooting people like mad. </sentence><sentence id="1753">If they were looking for somebody suspicious, everything was suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Let's say they looked for a guy...uh...uh...John Doe. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So if there were a hundred Joe Doe's, they killed a hundred John Doe's so they know they killed the one they supposed to. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And so...That's why had different names in difference birth certificates and all this, but after that the <span class="country">United States</span> passed a law that these people can get away with it for that only reason. </sentence><sentence id="1757">So I was stuck in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> with my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1758">It was very rough. </sentence><sentence id="1759">No food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1760">You know, no place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1761">The hardest thing was to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And...uh...and I worked in the <span class="building">ammunition factory</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1763">Mine job was, unfortunately, there some...were some good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1764">And I was what you call working in a <span class="region">division</span> where they didn't need me. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I wasn't necessary needed there. </sentence><sentence id="1766">But eventually I pushed myself into a <span class="building">plant</span> where I got...I worked very hard, but at least I was needed because I was afraid if I'm not needed, I'd be going. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So I eventually...we stood there for awhile, whether I think a week or two, and then they decided to...to make another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1768">They figured they're going to take out people which they don't want. </sentence><sentence id="1769">One was too heavy. </sentence><sentence id="1770">One was too skinny. </sentence><sentence id="1771">One wore glasses, and one looked funny. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1772">And every...uh...what you call boss, meister. </sentence><sentence id="1773">They called them <span class="building">meister</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1774">Let's say, every boss was in charge...let's say, like mine...the German which was in charge of mine group, he...the  6 Gestapo gave him orders, "You take out the ones you don't want." </sentence><sentence id="1775">So he picked. </sentence><sentence id="1776">Eventually, I wasn't working there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1777">The whole...the whole brigade went. </sentence><sentence id="1778">The whole brigade went. </sentence><sentence id="1779">Well, I worked in another <span class="populated place">division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1780">I worked in a <span class="building">machine shop</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1781">I was more needed. </sentence><sentence id="1782">So what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1783">They made another selection. </sentence><sentence id="1784">But they were afraid that this is not going to go by so easy. </sentence><sentence id="1785">People might revolt, so they took them out separate, 2, 4, 6, 8 and stuffed them down in a <span class="interior space">basement</span> in the <span class="building">police station</span> in the <span class="building">plant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1786">There were about 5, 6 hundred people in that <span class="interior space">basement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1787">They were afraid if they would march them out and put them on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> they might start jumping off the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, so there was a...uh...what you call __., </sentence><sentence id="1788">that's a...the <span class="building">building industry</span>, German fellow by the name Mosche, was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1789">He came from <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1790">He was what you call a boovon, a goovon, tough guy, you know, a German tough guy. </sentence><sentence id="1791">All of them were tough, but he was the one who says he's going to do it, so by taking the people out of the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, they let them out 2 at a time, he stood with a sledge hammer, hit everybody over the head. </sentence><sentence id="1792">So anybody came on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> was laying half dead and...and he locked and put him up and covered the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with blankets and took him down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="1794">And then we remained in that little place there, I think, I think, for 2 years... 2 years over there. </sentence><sentence id="1795">Misery, shooting, killing. </sentence><sentence id="1796">My brother was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1797">My brother...uh...was walking once, and there were a <span class="spatial object">train</span> came and with potatoes, and a potato fell out of the...uh...<span class="spatial object">train</span>, so he picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="1798">We always walked with little <span class="building">potties</span>, because you never knew when you get ahold of some food. </sentence><sentence id="1799">So he had the <span class="spatial

they wanted to know where he got the potato. </sentence><sentence id="1802">He says he picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="1803">They didn't believe him, so they took him down to the <span class="building">police station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1804">He was there, I think, a week. </sentence><sentence id="1805">My brother told me. </sentence><sentence id="1806">I wasn't there any more. </sentence><sentence id="1807">I went to another <span class="building">plant</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="1808">My brother told me that you couldn't tell his color, what color he was. </sentence><sentence id="1809">He was blue. </sentence><sentence id="1810">And...uh...finally couldn't get out of him because he didn't anything, so one day this...uh...Gestapo man came down. </sentence><sentence id="1811">His name was Stiglitz. </sentence><sentence id="1812">He was a short fellow. </sentence><sentence id="1813">He was a midget, very short. </sentence><sentence id="1814">With a gun he carried...the <span class="spatial object">revolver</span> he carried was almost as big as he was. </sentence><sentence id="1815">And he took...went down to the <span

<span class="dlf">yard</span>, and he shot him. </sentence><sentence id="1817">So he figured if him, the pail of water go over him so he wouldn't make a mess. </sentence><sentence id="1818">So my brother was shot then, and my other brother which worked in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> took him down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and buried him. </sentence><sentence

with...with my brothers, I sort of managed...you know...uh...certain time in the day when we got around after work, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock everybody had something. </sentence><sentence id="1849">One had a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1850">One couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1851">One...we were wheeling and dealing. </sentence><sentence id="1852">Let's say, you gave me half a onion, he gave me a haircut. </sentence><sentence id="1853">I gave you half a potato, you gave me half a carrot. </sentence><sentence id="1854">And that was...and you gave me a piece of thread to pick my pants, I gave you a needle, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And that's the way we operated. </sentence><sentence id="1856">When I got...when I left, I got to the other <span

much I weighed? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1859">I worked and what happened in the other <span class="populated place">camp</span>...had people from other <span class="populated

came from <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1862">There was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1863">They called it like <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Certain <span class="region">sections</span>, these people came there, there were tuffies. </sentence></p><p><sentence

id="1868">So they were tough. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And each time if there was some work to do, they grabbed us because we were the newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Took me down to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> to break up <span class="spatial object">monuments</span> and build the <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1871">And made me a fireman because any time, I don't know if was <span class="country">America</span> or <span class="country">Russian</span>...most <span class="spatial object">American planes</span>, <span class="spatial

was a fireman. </sentence><sentence id="1874">What I had in my possession is a little <span class="spatial object">pump</span> and a <span class="spatial object">pail</span>. </sentence><sentence

didn't need it, | walked because I had no feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And I used to carry a blanket with me...blanket, covered myself. </sentence><sentence id="1879">Cold. </sentence><sentence id="1880">I was shivering and walked back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="1882">And I had a neighbor...a friend. </sentence><sentence id="1883">He worked the day shift. </sentence><sentence id="1884">I worked the night shift, then we changed. </sentence><sentence id="1885">I don't know if he was old or young. </sentence><sentence id="1886">I couldn't tell his age. </sentence><sentence id="1887">He was very nice to me, and he was like a father to me then. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Because we were both...so we both shared the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1889">The blanket had more patches than the <span class="spatial

used to help me. </sentence><sentence id="1892">Each time I came I was downhearted. </sentence><sentence id="1893">I figured who needs this. </sentence><sentence id="1894">So he always used to encourage me, encourage me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1895">And...uh...he used to do work, and I used to be in charge of <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1896">I used to be in charge of <span class="spatial object">bullet machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I didn't know much, but I learned a little. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1899">The Germans had no equipment any more. </sentence><sentence id="1900">They ran out of tools because the Americans were bombing <span class="populated

oil. </sentence><sentence id="1902">They gave us oil to oil the <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1903">It was like kerosene. </sentence><sentence id="1904">It wasn't slippery. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Anything went wrong, we were blamed for. </sentence><sentence id="1906">One day...uh...one day, he gave me a part for a <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="1910">I could only put in the part. </sentence><sentence id="1911">I put in the part and the <span class="spatial object">machine</span> slipped because it didn't perform the job because there wasn't enough oil to slip the...the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So I broke it. </sentence><sentence id="1913">So he took me to the <span class="building">police station</span>, you know, and they gave me such a beating that I fainted and they threw me into the <span class="interior space">bath tub</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1914">Then took me out, and gave me another beating. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Then the next day, the...the...the boss who is charge of me, Mr. Ginter, he found out. </sentence><sentence id="1916">So he says to the other boss, "Why did you do that to him?" </sentence><sentence id="1917">He says, "Well," he says, in German, " means gotta turn to victory, and this man didn't perform. </sentence><sentence id="1918">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1919">I managed to stay on my feet, holding on. </sentence><sentence id="1920"><span class="interior space">I  8</span> couldn't hold on to my thing. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I was so beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="1922">But he let me live, because if it would have been somebody else, I would have been dead. </sentence><sentence id="1923">He knew me. </sentence><sentence id="1924">He knew me for 2 years. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Why was I...was he...he is, what you call...there's good enemies and bad enemies. </sentence><sentence id="1926">He was a good enemy, what you call. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He treated me...you ever see, you beat sometimes a dog. </sentence><sentence id="1928">You beat him so long that you have no use beating him. </sentence><sentence id="1929">You get used to him, so you beat somebody else. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1930">He always picked on somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1931">So he let me just live and finally he slipped in once a little cup of soup he got from somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1932">He came to me...he says to me, "I'm going to give you a loaf of bread, if you tell me who's going to win the war?" </sentence><sentence id="1933">I says what a...what a question to ask me, who's going to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I says, "I think.." He says, "Think about it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1935">Think about it." </sentence><sentence id="1936">So I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="1937">I figured I be dead by the time he comes back. </sentence><sentence id="1938">Okay. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1939">Came back 2 days later. </sentence><sentence id="1940">He says, "Who's going to win the war?" </sentence><sentence id="1941">I says, "You." </sentence><sentence id="1942">He gave me such a beating again, the same guy. </sentence><sentence id="1943">He threw me on the <span class="interior

id="1946">It was a weekend so we didn't work on Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="1947">So I laid in the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1948">There was some doctors there which weren't...nobody knew they're doctors...had some medication and some water and I bounced back pretty fast. </sentence><sentence id="1949">And that's where I spent my time over there. </sentence><sentence id="1950">It's terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1951">That thing was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1952">You couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="1953">You couldn't...a guy used to come at night....at the night shift. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1954">We used to work night. </sentence><sentence id="1955">He came in and he used to insist...if we make a hundred percent he gives a...a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1956">A loaf of bread was let's figure what you call...it was a kilo?...let's figure a regular loaf of bread, a round loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1957">How do you make a hundred percent if you haven't got the <span class="spatial object">machinery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I had girls working for me. </sentence><sentence id="1959">You know, I had about 6, 7 girls working, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1960">We used to share even what we had...even...even a <span class="dlf">pit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1961">Anything we shared. </sentence><sentence id="1962">They were nice. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And there were some girls from...which were shipped from other <span class="populated place">camps</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1964">Very nice girls. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And they used to help, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1966">Not with food, but...uh...morally, they used to perk you up. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And I had friend which worked with me which died, you know, so I was left without him. </sentence><sentence id="1968">He used to help me out. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And anytime the <span class="spatial object">machines</span> broke, what happened...these girls never ate. </sentence><sentence id="1970">And the Germans used to shave their hair off and put like onion bags on top of them, made out of three <span class="dlf">holes</span> for the head and for the two arms, and that's the way they used to walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1971">They had never dressed, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1972">And you know how a woman has to take care of herself more than a man. </sentence><sentence id="1973">They looked awful, but they were worked with me. </sentence><sentence id="1974">And anytime <span class="spatial object">machine</span> was broke and he came back and he got mad, he took and shot her in the <span class="interior space">back yard</span> right away. </sentence><sentence id="1975">So there's one left. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1976">That's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="1977">But...uh...it was part of my life. ... </sentence><sentence id="1978">uh...I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1979">I couldn't wait it's going to be me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1980">But how do you get rid of this misery. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And...he used to be...he used to drink a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1982">This...uh...German, who used to be in charge of me. </sentence><sentence id="1983">His name used to be Prosser. </sentence><sentence id="1984"><span class="populated place">Prosser</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1985">He came back from the <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1986">He lost two fingers. </sentence><sentence id="1987">So he wasn't good for the army, so they sent him to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1988">He knew about <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> like I know how to be an astronaut today. </sentence><sentence id="1989">But okay, maybe he had some relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And he came with his wife. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1991">His wife used to be a blonde. </sentence><sentence id="1992">She used to be so experienced slapping people, I don't know how fast. </sentence><sentence id="1993">You didn't know what hit you. </sentence><sentence id="1994">She slapped you on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="1995">Even if you...you moved away, you couldn't miss her. </sentence><sentence id="1996">So fast. </sentence><sentence id="1997">Left and right, she used to slap. </sentence><sentence id="1998">She slapped...the woman used to slap, and kick em, and spit on them. </sentence><sentence id="1999">That's what she used to do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2000">But she was nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="2001">She saw that each time she saw me...not that she greeted me, but she threw sort of a friendly...not a smile, but a friendly look. </sentence><sentence id="2002">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="2003">And...uh...she used to  9 help me sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="2004">You know, I used to say, "Can you give me some bread." </sentence><sentence id="2005">She says, "I'm not allowed to." </sentence><sentence id="2006">But what she used to do, each time she passed by the <span class="spatial object">machine</span>, she made believe she dropped something. </sentence><sentence id="2007">She looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="2008">Sometimes a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2009">But I used to work at night. </sentence><sentence id="2010">I used to work at night, so I used to go into his <span class="building">office</span> because if I needed a part, I went into his <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2011">So he was sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="2012">He soundly slept, and he had a little <span class="spatial object">satchel</span> where he kept his food. </sentence><sentence id="2013">So if he was sleeping, he was drunk. </sentence><sentence id="2014">I took a sandwich out from his...uh...uh...attache case. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And I ran into the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2016">The <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> wasn't cleaned for 5 years, so the odor and the salami sandwich sort of the combination, people were sitting there, they couldn't tell that I'm eating. </sentence><sentence id="2017">Then I washed my mouth out with water and say, "What are you eating?" </sentence><sentence id="2018">I says, "No, I got ahold of a piece of...uh...garlic." </sentence><sentence id="2019">And got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="2020">That's helped me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Sometimes, some day, I went up and he was sleeping, I saw an apple. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2022">I took in an apple. </sentence><sentence id="2023">For me to eat an apple, for me to eat a...a...salami sandwich, is like for somebody giving a shot to think that...that sandwich used to go into my stomach is like you're dropping a...a something to an empty <span class="spatial object">barrel</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2024">But I was swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2025">I didn't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="2026">I was...I was a mess. </sentence><sentence id="2027">I was a mess already. </sentence><sentence id="2028">Finally, what happened, in...uh...one night I was working, so friend of mine...friend, he was passing by with a...with a metal, little <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2029">Was carrying something. </sentence><sentence id="2030">And I had no shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2031">I was wearing wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2032">So he went in back of me, and he ripped my skin off from my feet, you know, not knowing. </sentence><sentence id="2033">So I turned around and I rapped him in the mouth. </sentence><sentence id="2034">So the...the...uh... the police saw it, took my name down. </sentence><sentence id="2035">The next day they took me to the <span class="building">police station</span>, and they gave me a beating. </sentence><sentence id="2036">So one guy tipped off said, "Leave him along. </sentence><sentence id="2037">His brother just died, so give him a break." </sentence><sentence id="2038">They gave me a...a less beating. </sentence><sentence id="2039">But that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2040">They used to carry on terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Terrible things used to go...used to go on. </sentence><sentence id="2042">And then what happened finally...finally, the Russian army started advancing closer to...to <span class="country">Poland</span> because the Americans helped them out with arms, with <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> because they were really in bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So they start advancing and the army was very powerful, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2044">Good soldiers they had. </sentence><sentence id="2045">They started reaching already closer to our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2046">So they decided they didn't want to leave nobody, so they...they set up <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2047">They had no <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2048">They made you walk on the...on the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2049">And shipped...shipped most of the...rest of the Jews to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2050">I was sort of the...uh...the old coot. </sentence><sentence id="2051">My boss thought that the Germans could fight off the onslaught from the Russian army, so eventually the fight...if he's safe, I'm safe, so he could open himself a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2052">And slaves there's enough. </sentence><sentence id="2053">If there wouldn't be no Jews, there would be Pollack. </sentence><sentence id="2054">They wouldn't be no Pollacks, there'd be others. </sentence><sentence id="2055">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="2056">There were plenty, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2057">So I remain...I...I was left. </sentence><sentence id="2058">I had...my clothes I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2059">The only thing I had one shirt...uh...polyester shirt which was already in shreds from washing in detergent, and I had a pair of pants which was ripped and was cold. </sentence><sentence id="2060">Each time it blew, it like air condition over <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2061">And I was cold all the time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2062">And...and they start taking people out of the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2063">Everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2064">This guy left. </sentence><sentence id="2065">The guy which used to be in with me sharing the <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2066">They took him. </sentence><sentence id="2067">And I was holding on to the..uh...to the <span class="spatial object">boards</span> where we were sleeping cause I couldn't stay on my feet because I was too weak. </sentence><sentence id="2068">So I remained and they shipped everybody out. </sentence><sentence id="2069">At night...the same night after they shipped him, some were caught at the...the Russian army caught the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and busted the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> up and let the prisoners out. </sentence><sentence id="2070">And some of them...and the Germans took off at night. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2071">They didn't take no <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2072">They walked on their...on the <span class="dlf">tracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2073">So some of the Russian army got ahold of them and shot them right on the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> and some of them escaped, but some of  0 them most of the Jews were shipped to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2074">They were shipped to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2075">My brothers were shipped to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2076">Some came back and some didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2077">And I was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2078">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="2079">I was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I was liberated and the <span class="spatial object">Russian trucks</span> and army came in and looked around. </sentence><sentence id="2081">So many sick and dead people. </sentence><sentence id="2082">Some died. </sentence><sentence id="2083">The flies were eating them alive and the insects and all this. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And I remained in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> with not too many people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2085">Many people...some of them which were stronger were running toward the <span class="building">police station</span> to pick up rifles when the German...uh...picked up rifles and they were shooting in the <span class="dlf">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And I figured, "Hey, this is not for me here. </sentence><sentence id="2087">If they ever come, we're finished. </sentence><sentence id="2088">Not that...I was finished anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I could hardly walk. </sentence><sentence id="2090">So I figured I take my little...uh...can I had. </sentence><sentence id="2091">I had all the time with me like a gallon paint. </sentence><sentence id="2092">It was a <span class="spatial object">can</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2093">And I used to make in that can. </sentence><sentence id="2094">I used to eat in that can. </sentence><sentence id="2095">I used to do everything in that can. </sentence><sentence id="2096">That can used to be for every use, what human use you could use. </sentence><sentence id="2097">And that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2098">Sometimes I didn't wash it because I figured, "Who cares." </sentence><sentence id="2099">Didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="2100">So I decided I take that can and my wooden shoes I had and which were ripped. </sentence><sentence id="2101">They...I couldn't even walk in them anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2102">They were...and I decided I leave the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2103">Because I was liberated in the same <span class="populated place">town</span>, I figured I march out. </sentence><sentence id="2104">If I marched out, it took me awhile. </sentence><sentence id="2105">I marched. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Some people say, "Where you going." </sentence><sentence id="2107">Said, "I'm going." " </sentence><sentence id="2108">Oh, you live in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2109">So you must know. </sentence><sentence id="2110">You got your <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2111">They thought I got a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2112">I got a <span class="building">mansion</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2113">There was nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="2114">I was a poor...poor family. </sentence><sentence id="2115">Marched out of <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="2120">Came into <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2121">Russian soldiers were there. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Were hunting down the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Most of the SS were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2124">Some of them were hiding in the big <span class="spatial object">German trucks</span> where they keep the tools, like big <span class="interior space">drawers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2125">They shoved themselves in there. </sentence><sentence id="2126">The Russians were very mad at them because, you know, the Russians lost over 20 million people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2127">They treated the <span class="country">Russian</span> very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2128">So they grabbed them out and shoot them and shot them and...and then they went to liberate the <span class="populated place">Russian camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2129">There was a <span class="populated place">Russian camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2130">People were almost dead. </sentence><sentence id="2131">There wasn't much left. </sentence><sentence id="2132">They
