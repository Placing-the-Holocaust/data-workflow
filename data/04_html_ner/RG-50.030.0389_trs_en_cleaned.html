<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1805">A: Well, that was an extremely hard time for me. </sentence><sentence id="1806">In the morning, the di -- the children changed their clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1807">They had clothes that belonged to the <span class="building">daycare center</span>, and they had to be washed. </sentence><sentence id="1808">So one of my jobs at one time was to wash clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Now, there's no harm in this, if somebody tells you how to wash clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1810">I can only advise you never to wash clothes like that. </sentence><sentence id="1811">I didn't have any more skin on my fingers. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I mean, my life has been saved, so I'm not complaining, I'm just telling you. </sentence><sentence id="1813">In the morning my -- my fingers were all raw. </sentence><sentence id="1814">I couldn't hardly do this, but I had to wash washing again. </sentence><sentence id="1815">Do the washing again. </sentence><sentence id="1816">For some reason which is not understandable, we're not given enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1817">Not because there wasn't enough food, but because, I suppose, the matron, and the sister learned at some <span class="building">school</span> or other, you give so many grams of these vegetable, so many grams of that vegetable, and so many grams of meat. </sentence><sentence id="1818">I suppose that must be the case. </sentence><sentence id="1819">And you didn't help yourself, you're -- just like David Copperfield, it was put on your <span class="spatial object">plate</span>, like this. </sentence><sentence id="1820">I was always hungry there. </sentence><sentence id="1821">Now, the other fellow nurses -- trainees, were also hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1822">But they went into the <span class="interior space">larder</span> in the evening, secretly, and took whatever they needed to satisfy their hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1823">They didn't take me with them, but they said afterwards when it was found out, that it was me who had taken the food. </sentence><sentence id="1824">I mean, that sort of thing I've never encountered in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1825">I was taught sort of, one stuck together. </sentence><sentence id="1826">I would have gone with them, I would have helped myself too, I was never a -- my English was as good as non- existent [indecipherable] in those days, and yes, I remember there was -- we were sleeping all together, 10 or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And I had a drawing which I very much liked, and I took with me, my drawing teacher did that. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And I put it with -- I put it on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> with pins -- with -- and every morning it was found taken down. </sentence><sentence id="1829">Now, I wouldn't, if I live in a <span class="building">house</span> where there -- a <span class="building">house</span> where there's a <span class="dlf">wall</span>, I wouldn't advise anybody to do this either, but I would have talked to the girl, and said don't -- please don't pin it up, makes <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1830">But it's just taken down, and -- and that sort of -- those sort of things were very bad to take. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And I had -- I remember very clearly that I had to take care of 25 children who had a rest after lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And they were supposed to close their eyes and sleep, if possible, but at least keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Well, under my care they didn't keep quiet, and I didn't know how to ke -- let them -- how to manage to keep them quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1834">So I shouted at them, and I remember very clearly that I always said, "Shut your eyeses." </sentence><sentence id="1835">Which was a great success in the way of humoring them, and they thought it was very funny indeed. </sentence><sentence id="1836">So that was a -- and I remember more. </sentence><sentence id="1837">I remember that every two weeks -- it could have been every week, there was no reason why half of the trainees stayed over, and the other could leave for the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="1838">But however -- before every -- before that half which had the weekend off could leave, the whole place had to be cleaned, washed. </sentence><sentence id="1839">Now, after awhile I realize if I just throw water over the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, that'll do nicely, and get us off quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1840">But I had thought that cleaning the place means taking off whatever dirt. </sentence><sentence id="1841">So it took me -- I'm always -- I've always been slow, it took me ages to get it, and the others couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="1842">So that didn't -- couldn't leave until everything was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1843">So that -- that didn't make me much more popular either. </sentence><sentence id="1844">On the other hand, there was a party at -- which wasn't very far, the people, Stevenson, I lived -- I had -- they had brought me over, didn't live very far. </sentence><sentence id="1845">They had a party, and there was cake left over. </sentence><sentence id="1846">And the rest of the cake was brought to me. </sentence><sentence id="1847">I had a chauffer at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1848">It never occurred to me, I wasn't brought up that way, it never occurred to me when I had the <span class="spatial object">cake</span>, not to vide it -- divide it among everybody in equal parts. </sentence><sentence id="1849">So everybody had something, but they didn't take me into the <span class="interior space">larder</span> with them. </sentence><sentence id="1850">One of the things that had to be done to be a children's nurse  1 one day, is to knit -- to knit something for a child. </sentence><sentence id="1851">Well, I would never finished it, because there was always some -- something wrong with it, and I have to try -- like Penelope, I always say to -- to [indecipherable] again, and start all over again. </sentence><sentence id="1852">I would never meant -- made it. </sentence><sentence id="1853">That war broke out in September, and the -- the children were evacuated, and the place closed down. </sentence><sentence id="1854">So I went back to those -- to family Stevenson, and thought I was lucky, but then my hard time really started. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1957">A: By the time I learned to speak English, I had conversations with her, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I don't think she had any understanding of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I used to write letters, that took an awful long time. </sentence><sentence id="1960">By hand, of course, not by computer. </sentence><sentence id="1961">And I don't think we had much in common, but I can tell you one thing that might illustrate the coldness. </sentence><sentence id="1962">I told you about our Christmas celebration. </sentence><sentence id="1963">Well, in the beginning of December, or the middle of December, it was decided that the family was going away somewhere for Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1964">There was another maid in the <span class="building">house</span>, she was also a Austrian refugee, but she didn't live  2 with the family, she came over as a maid. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Everybody was going to leave the <span class="building">house</span>, but the <span class="building">house</span> couldn't be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1966">So it was decided that I should stay. </sentence><sentence id="1967">So I stayed all alone over Christmas in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1968">Snow was falling, to make it a picture. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Well, when I learned that I couldn't leave, I couldn't go to my sister, to my relatives, I had the first nervous breakdown crying spell in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I couldn't stop myself. </sentence><sentence id="1971">Afterwards, when it came to the 21 -- 24" of December, I'd calmed down, but it was very, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1972">So that might illustrate the coldness. </sentence></p></dialogue>
