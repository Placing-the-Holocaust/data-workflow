( </sentence><sentence id="23">Chuckle) (Pause) I had a younger sister, Helena. </sentence><sentence id="24">No. </sentence><sentence id="25"><span class="populated place">Marga</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh... The strongest memories are of holidays. </sentence><sentence id="27"><span class="env feature">Christmas tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father pretending to talk to the angel because in Polish Catholic tradition, it was the angel that brought the gifts at Christmas time. </sentence><sentence id="29">St. Nicholas came on December 6 and put things under the <span class="spatial object">pillows</span> of good children. </sentence><sentence id="30">Bad children got little twigs. </sentence><sentence id="31">We got both. </sentence><sentence id="32">So it was...uh...a rather confusing message that we were getting. </sentence><sentence id="33">I guess we were getting a message that we were alright, but we were not perfect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: What happened as the war grew closer? </sentence><sentence id="55">You became older. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh...As you became a young teenager, where did you go to <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, I went to <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> until 1937 and in 1937, after a long struggle, my parents managed to obtain a permission from the Polish...pre-War Polish authorities that my mother could be transferred and could teach in the same <span class="populated place">town</span> in which my father was working. </sentence><sentence id="61">Uh...A rather unbelievable situation for us today in <span class="country">America</span>, but it was common place in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">So in 1937, we moved from <span class="populated place">Vilena</span>, the <span class="populated place">village</span> near <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> and we moved to <span class="populated place">Boleslawiece</span>, which was a sort of a equivalent of <span class="populated place">Houston</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span>, of...of the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">And we...there I lived with my father for the remaining 2 years before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="64">And there I went to a <span class="building">private elementary school</span> which was called </sentence></p><p><sentence id="65"> (nh). </sentence><sentence id="66">And._uh.. finished the last srade which I believe was 6th and took mv <span class="dlf">entrance</span>  going on and we children were becoming slowly aware of the gathering <span class="env feature">clouds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">And my father was a reserve...uh...uh...officer. </sentence><sentence id="68">He was a first lieutenant...I guess lieutenant in the Polish army, and in August...uh...the reserve company in that he was part of went on maneuvers. </sentence><sentence id="69">I was Il and a half, and that was the last time I saw him until I saw him in the <span class="country">United States</span> in January 1949. </sentence><sentence id="70">He never came back. </sentence><sentence id="71">The war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="72">He was fighting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="73">Uh...Of course, we didn't know what was going to happen and about the tenor of the pre- war Polish press was...uh...we will fight the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="74">We will not let them take over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">So little did we know how powerful Nazis armies were. </sentence><sentence id="76">And the war broke out and..uh...(sigh) within a few days, first waves of refugees started coming.,... </sentence><sentence id="77">telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army, by the indiscriminate bombing, by the German air force of crowded <span class="dlf">roads</span> filled with refugees, with..with men, women, children, possessions, animals. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78"> Uh...It was extremely scary. </sentence><sentence id="79">It...Many times I said to my friends who are questioning me about this period that my childhood ended on September 1, 39. </sentence><sentence id="80">Uh...Within couple weeks, the threat of the advancing German armies were so great that all the able bodied men who otherwise were not in the armies started drifting east to escape the advancing German armies. </sentence><sentence id="81">To escape...to possibly join the Polish army somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="82">And that's where...I forget the date, but obviously it's known to history...uh...suddenly as...as.. as we realized we were stabbed in the back by the Soviet armies marching into <span class="country">Poland</span> from the <span class="region">east</span> and completely...uh.. destroying whatever little resistance there was to...to the advancing German forces. </sentence><sentence id="83">Only then we learned about the Molitov/Ribbontrop (ph) pact, dividing <span class="country">Poland</span> and within a couple days after this event, the Germans marched into <span class="populated place">Boleslawiece</span> and...uh..for some reason I remember the...the day very vividly because that was the day that I had to an optometrist to pick up my first pair of glasses. </sentence><sentence id="84">And they were little beady little things...uh..but I had to wear them and I walked out of the <span class="building">optometrist's shop</span> and the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> kind of looked crooked, but people were pointing out to...to the advancing...marching German. </sentence><sentence id="85">Actually men...Germans didn't march. </sentence><sentence id="86">They were riding <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, and their green uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="87">People were reaching out to them, and the Germans were throwing cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="88">That was my first impression of the German army. </sentence><sentence id="89">Uh...Within time that I cannot determine and now in retrospect I know that it was pursuant to some agreement between the Russians and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="90">The Germans withdrew and the Soviet troops moved in. </sentence><sentence id="91">They were...uh...they were shabby looking, and they were...they were terribly looking...uh...neglected by our standards, un...unused to western facilities. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="92">Uh...Immediately in ...in <span class="building">private homes</span>, Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="93"> They had to be explained about <span class="spatial object">toilet bowls</span> and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="94">They didn't know what they were for. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What about you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="97">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were. </sentence><sentence id="98">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="100">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the <span class="building">schools</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to <span class="building">school</span>, encouraged to return to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">New subjects were introduced. </sentence><sentence id="103">Russian. </sentence><sentence id="104">Ukrainian since this part of <span class="country">Poland</span> was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="105">And we were...back in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="106">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted. </sentence><sentence id="107">I was bring nothing but <span class="dlf">Ds</span> and Cs from <span class="building">school</span>, and I was an A student before. </sentence><sentence id="108">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something is wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Uh...But obviously we were in..in...in great fear for what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="110">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span> called <span class="populated place">Yur</span> (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends. </sentence><sentence id="111">We were permitted by the authorities to send a <span class="dlf">wire</span> to my father...in German, and to this day I remember the text of the <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112"><span class="building">Gesei Gesunt</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="113">We are healthy. </sentence><sentence id="114">We are well. </sentence><sentence id="115">That's all we were permitted to say in that <span class="dlf">wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time. </sentence><sentence id="117">Uh...In the meantime, the <span class="building">Russian school</span> continued. </sentence><sentence id="118">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us. </sentence><sentence id="119">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated. </sentence><sentence id="120">And...uh...I may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">And uh, we were so involved in our own little world. </sentence><sentence id="122">Uh...The boys were talking about sex serupticiously. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were organizing <span class="building">poetry circles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh...We were exchanging letters. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had <span class="building">school</span> mail where we would write letters to each other and..uh.. And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the <span class="populated place">city</span>, but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, such as a <span class="building">power house</span> and a lot of other installations. </sentence><sentence id="127">And the German, Nazis returned. </sentence><sentence id="128">And that is really when the terror started in earnest. </sentence><sentence id="129">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a...a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="130">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into <span class="populated place">town</span> and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh..and we, of course, stayed <span class="building">home</span> petrified and  just didn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed. </sentence><sentence id="132">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="133">We started getting hungry. </sentence><sentence id="134">Everything was disrupted. </sentence><sentence id="135">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh..collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their <span class="spatial object">war machine</span> drive into <span class="country">Russia</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="136">Sigh) I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh...I do not recall the details. </sentence><sentence id="138">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom. </sentence><sentence id="139">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too. </sentence><sentence id="140">You killed the rest of my family." </sentence><sentence id="141">That's the only detail that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="142">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh..desperate. </sentence><sentence id="143">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food. </sentence><sentence id="144">I remember through a friend we traded a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="145">People were trading <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, taking them to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and getting some grain. </sentence><sentence id="146">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a <span class="spatial object">coffee grinder</span>, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the <span class="spatial object">gas burning stove</span> and that would be our food. </sentence><sentence id="147">So it was really hard. </sentence><sentence id="148">So then we decided that we have to get back to <span class="region">central Poland</span> where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Before you move, you have talked about the pogroms in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">Can you tell me, when you came out from your <span class="building">house</span>, what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Pogroms in... in <span class="populated place">Boreslawiece</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="210">In <span class="populated place">Boreslawiece</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Yal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Uh...What were the...what was it like? </sentence><sentence id="216">Did you have any Jewish friends at that time, any Jewish acquaintances. </sentence><sentence id="217">Can you tell us? </sentence><sentence id="218">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="224">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="225">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="226">I visited one friend's <span class="building">house</span> after that. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...And....uh...I came into the <span class="building">house</span> and I remember talking to his mother who was in tears and saying to me...uh...,Look, Panjawatko (ph), Mr. Witkowski (ph),in Polish you would Mr., but you would use the first name as sort of a half way familiar term between first name and using the last name. </sentence><sentence id="228">They just ran into the <span class="building">house</span> and ransacked it. </sentence><sentence id="229">Look at this beautiful <span class="populated place">Trammel</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="230"> <span class="building">Trammel</span> (ph) was a long, tall <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> that would have some sort of a <span class="spatial object">pedestal</span> on the bottom, and a little <span class="spatial object">shelf</span> in front of it like a <span class="spatial object">mantel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">They just came in and threw a stone in it and just shattered the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="232">Fortunately, in this friend's family nobody was hurt or killed, but I have heard about numerous situations in which people were...were beaten up or killed by the...by the Ukrainian peasants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Please go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Uh... Those days are pretty much in haze. </sentence><sentence id="246">Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in <span class="populated place">Boreslawiece</span> except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were, where the...my mother's family lived. </sentence><sentence id="247">So on a crowded <span class="spatial object">train</span> at night, I traveled from <span class="populated place">Boreslawiece</span> back to <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> some...some time before Christmas, probably in <span class="populated place">41</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">Eventually, my mother and my sister joined us, joined me in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, and the rest of the war was spent in <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, living first with one and...and then with another, having a <span class="interior space">room</span> in their crowded <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">In those days, it was very lucky if you could have one <span class="interior space">room</span> to one family. </sentence><sentence id="250">And the following years until about 1944 was spent primarily Mother working in...uh...in...uh...in a <span class="building">factory</span> and then eventually working her way to a <span class="building">food store</span> that was next to the <span class="building">German controlled factory</span> where she...everybody had rations and everybody was allowed to get only so much bread, so much butter, so much other things. </sentence><sentence id="251">I learned what ersatz (ph) coffee is. </sentence><sentence id="252">I learned many other things that I had not learned before in my life. </sentence><sentence id="253">Uh...Among us youngsters, there were roughly my temporaries among the children of the two aunts, we organized secret teaching. </sentence><sentence id="254">That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans, of course, closed all the <span class="building">schools</span> and prohibited in the entire <span class="country">country</span> any normal education except the first few grades of <span class="building">elementary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh... The population of those <span class="region">areas</span> was destined only to be able to read and write so they would obey <span class="country">Germany</span> orders in the future....uh..future world run by the German...by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="256">We knew that we had to move because in the part of the <span class="populated place">city</span> where my aunt lived, the Nazis were organizing the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">We had to leave the <span class="building">house</span> and move to another part of <span class="populated place">town</span> and that part of <span class="populated place">town</span> was fenced in and all the Jewish population of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> were...was ordered to live in... in...uh...in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="258">They were guarded by some sort of a uniformed police. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were not allowed to leave the <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were required to wear either a Star of David or a arm band with a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="261">Uh...The next few years...uh...were characterized by increasing terror, increasing executions, deportations of all the leading citizens of the <span class="populated place">town</span> to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">Not only Mayor and the...and the prominent citizens, doctors, lawyers, teachers,...uh...but even anybody who would be a member of what was called in these days intelligencia, you know, people with higher education were being systematically exterminated by the Nazis, taken to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="263">At the same time, there was a gradual growth of underground, of resistance, of organizing, not only the adults into groups that would be  preparing for eventual struggle because that no one had any doubt that Nazi terror has to end one day. </sentence><sentence id="264">Not only to prepare for armed struggle but in the meantime to collect information about troop movements, about the...uh...the activities of the Nazis,...uh..documenting their atrocities against the population. </sentence><sentence id="265">Uh...Learning how to move around the <span class="populated place">city</span>, including us youngsters who were organized in units of clandestine scouts. </sentence><sentence id="266">Before the war, <span class="country">Poland</span> had a very active scouting movement and after the occupation many teenagers were organized into units to...to prepare for the eventual struggle against the Nazis, but in the meantime learning, reconnoitring...uh..moving from one part of the <span class="populated place">city</span>...uh...avoiding main <span class="dlf">arteries</span>, being able to cross...uh...through <span class="dlf">court yards</span> and jump over <span class="dlf">fences</span> and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="267">And...uh...eventually learning the Morse alphabet and things like this and eventually we were...a few of us were designated as a unit to provide...serve as...uh... curious when I talk about these times, I'm forgetting some of the English words. </sentence><sentence id="268">I only remember Polish words. </sentence><sentence id="269">Word, warshanetza, where the...uh...the people who were runners from one <span class="building">partisan unit</span> to another. </sentence><sentence id="270">Young boys were chosen for this purpose because they were not adults and they had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and they could avoid Germans in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">But if...in those days, the <span class="building">partisan units</span> had no way of communicating with each other, very few <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, so they were using youngsters to carry a message from one end to another. </sentence><sentence id="272">And a group of us, about a dozen or so, were sent into the <span class="building">partisan unit</span> that was active in...in the area of <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How was that like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Uh, that was a most curious experience. </sentence><sentence id="304">We slept during the day. </sentence><sentence id="305">We marched at night. </sentence><sentence id="306">I had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">Each one of us had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">We had no arms, of course. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were dressed in civilian clothing to look inconspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="310">I learned how to walk and sleep at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="311">Walking with a friend, locked in arms, and just marching in a <span class="spatial object">column</span> at night and sleeping at the same time, or leaning on your <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and...uh...uh...somehow managing to...to sleep and walk at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="312">During the day we would lie low because the Germans, of course, controlled the <span class="region">countryside</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">Uh...I encountered some Jewish survivors of the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> that were in the meantime being liquidated by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="314">I did not know which <span class="populated place">town</span> they were from but I remember two of the men that were...uh...employed quote unquote by the <span class="building">headquarters</span>...uh...uh...unit of this regiment, that was called regiment. </sentence><sentence id="315">Uh,...I don't know what they were doing, but they were...they were there. </sentence><sentence id="316">I remember seeing them. </sentence><sentence id="317">They looked terribly neglected, terribly impoverished, terribly...uh...they looked like...like driven animals because presumably of the experiences they went through. </sentence><sentence id="318">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="319">When most of the group was disband in the fall of  44, presumably they stayed with the group because we, in the summer of 44 were concentrating all of the underground forces to go to help the uprising in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> which broke out among this time, but, of <span class="dlf">course</span>, that was a unsuccessful attempt because the..the <span class="dlf">crossings</span> of major <span class="env feature">rivers</span> were guarded and these partisan units did not have heavy armor or artillery or anything. </sentence><sentence id="320">So after about 3 or 4 months I returned <span class="building">home</span> to my mother and my sister, covered with lice, dirty, very, very...uh...skinny. </sentence><sentence id="321">Had some infection in my fingers. </sentence><sentence id="322">The skin would simply balloon around the fingers and fill with some sort of pus or some sort of fluid. </sentence><sentence id="323">The nail would come off with the skin when the thing started healing. </sentence><sentence id="324">I...I couldn't sleep in the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">For weeks, I would

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="768">Testimony was, in most cases, limited to description of <span class="dlf">property</span>, possessions, but in many situations the survivors of those years...uh...who came to the <span class="building">commission offices</span> here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> testified as to their...uh..experiences during the Nazi's occupation. </sentence><sentence id="769">And I'm sure the records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the so-called Polish Program have that testimony and they're probably in the U.S. Archives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: How did you...you first. </sentence><sentence id="774">How did you handle all of this? </sentence><sentence id="775">How did you feel when you...your seeing these people and dealing with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: First, I wanted to do a good job. </sentence><sentence id="780">First, I wanted justice done. </sentence><sentence id="781">I did want to make sure that if there is any doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="782">There were other families. </sentence><sentence id="783">We were, after all, involved in a rather futile attempt to at least compensate materially for the...the enormity of evil that happened to these families, both Jewish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="784">Unfortunately, under American law, we had the obstacles, such as citizenship at the time of loss. </sentence><sentence id="785">And many, many people did not meet the requirement of <span class="country">U.S.</span> citizenship by the time of loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="786">We could not grant compensation award reparations to peoples who were not American nationals or citizens at the time the loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="787">I remember distinctly one decision which I, myself, was very pleased about...uh...because we applied a legal principal that permitted granting reparations to a much greater number of people rather than if we simply applied the official date of confiscation of the...of the <span class="dlf">property</span>...uh...by the communists regime. </sentence><sentence id="788">We used the concept of loss of use and enjoyment. </sentence><sentence id="789">Very often, communists in their profidious manipulation of the records and...and the law would leave the title and people, but would so restrict the rights of the owners or the ...uh...benefits that owners would derive from ownership of the property that for all intents and purposes, these people had all the burdens without any benefits. </sentence><sentence id="790">A  6 <span class="building">rental property</span> for instance. </sentence><sentence id="791">So we then developed the concept that it was the loss of use and enjoyment of the <span class="dlf">property</span> rather than the passage of title to the state that determined when people lost their possessions. </sentence><sentence id="792">And that's how we were able to...to award compensation to people who otherwise would not have gotten it. </sentence><sentence id="793">On a deeper level (Pause) ....Dr. Kuzmack, it's very hard to think of those times without projecting on those times, what I feel today. </sentence><sentence id="794">We all evolve and we all become much more sensitized and much more aware of...uh...the measure of tragedy than at the time that we are involved in the mechanics or addressing this or that narrow issue. </sentence><sentence id="795">I cannot really tell how I felt about it because honestly the same goes for my life. </sentence><sentence id="796">Today, I think I'm a much more aware person. </sentence><sentence id="797">I'm much more in touch with my emotions than at that time. </sentence><sentence id="798">That's an honest answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: I felt a regret at times and I have tried to put it to rest because it was a naive regret that had I been older maybe I would have been able to do more when I saw inhumanity and evil of those years. </sentence><sentence id="822">At the same time, I'm...I'm honest enough to admit that it's a...it's a hope tinged with fear because I wonder how many of us would have lived up the ideal of really disregarding our own safety and our own obligation to our loved ones to help a fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="823">How many of us would really live up to this principle when tested? </sentence><sentence id="824">I think there is a awareness in <span class="country">Poland</span> today which I sense from letters from relatives and friends and visits from friends and relatives...uh...what...what a great loss <span class="country">Poland</span> suffered because of the extermination of its Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="825">As a child, as a youngster, I read...uh..some of the greatest poets and writers of <span class="country">Poland</span> who were Jews, Julian Tooly (ph) and...and so many others. </sentence><sentence id="826">Uh...<span class="country">Poland</span> is impoverished. </sentence><sentence id="827">To what extent it could have been prevented or its...its enormity limited, who's to judge? </sentence><sentence id="828">I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters, that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being, we do it to ourselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
