<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">HERBERT FRIEDMAN June 12, 1992 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Okay, for the record give us your name and a little bit about your early background? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Herbert Friedman. </sentence><sentence id="6">And my early background is really very simple. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in <span class="populated place">New Haven</span> in 1918. </sentence><sentence id="8">My father had migrated to the <span class="country">States</span> from <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, my mother from <span class="populated place">Riga</span>, good stock. </sentence><sentence id="9">The two of them, they met and married in <span class="populated place">Connecticut</span> I think it was, and that's where I grew up. </sentence><sentence id="10">I went to <span class="building">high school</span> there, I went to <span class="building">university</span> there, and graduated from <span class="building">Yale</span> in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="11">Two brothers, both of whom are still living. </sentence><sentence id="12">A strong, tight, good Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="13">Conservative congregation in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">Quite modern in those days, from my parents, men and women sitting together, <span class="spatial object">organ</span> in the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="15">The Rabbi, a wonderful person, himself Vilna-born, but took a Ph.D. at <span class="building">Yale</span>, writing three volumes of the history of the Jews of <span class="country">Russia</span> in English. </sentence><sentence id="16">I mean that was a man, good brain, good human being, and working in this small middle class ordinary congregation, nothing famous about him, but very impressive to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What was your awareness of the rise of Hitler as you were growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well, that's the whole story. </sentence><sentence id="32">The whole story of my life revolves around that. </sentence><sentence id="33">In <span class="building">college</span> between the years of 1934 to "38, formative years, fully cognizant of what was happening, as fully as anybody could be who watched carefully. </sentence><sentence id="34">The argument that people didn't know what was going on in those days has never never seemed valid to me because you could read it in the <span class="building">New York Times</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">1 did. </sentence><sentence id="36">If I did, others did. </sentence><sentence id="37">But at any rate, it bothered me when I looked around "34, "35, "36, in "36 the Nuremberg laws were passed. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was quite clear what the intent was. </sentence><sentence id="39">Hitler's book was out. </sentence><sentence id="40">He had been in <span class="building">jail</span> in <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span>, he wrote it there back in 1925. </sentence><sentence id="41">The book was available to be read. </sentence><sentence id="42">I read parts of it. </sentence><sentence id="43">It's turgid writing, it's not easy, Mein Kampf, but never mind you've got the picture. </sentence><sentence id="44">So that I could not understand the silence of the whole <span class="populated place">American Jewish Community</span> around me. </sentence><sentence id="45">I did understand some of the politics. </sentence><sentence id="46">There was a difference quite clear in those days between the "Ost-Juden," the Russian-Polish Jews and the German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="47">The American Jewish Committee was in correspondence with people in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> who were advising them quiet, don't raise a fuss, you'll make it worse, don't organize protests, no, don't listen to Stephen Wise, don't have a parade down <span class="dlf">Fifth Avenue</span>, and they were attracted by that kind of advice, they were even enchanted by it. </sentence><sentence id="48">It gave them a perfect rationalization. </sentence><sentence id="49">Now, there not the only villain in the piece, everybody latched on to that. </sentence><sentence id="50">So I don't want to be misunderstood about the <span class="building">American Jewish Committee</span> only or specifically. </sentence><sentence id="51">The mood was (a) we're not sure of what's happening, (b) it can't be as bad as some people are saying it is, (c) what can we do about it anyhow, and (d) the American Government isn't disturbed, and Franklin Roosevelt is a great friend of the Jews and he isn't upset. </sentence><sentence id="52">Nobody is upset. </sentence><sentence id="53">All of these factors seemed to me to be leading to a dreadful conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="54">So on the specific point of how I was reacting in terms of what I saw around me, I was getting more and more furious, that's a worthwhile word, and frustrated and that was the condition that I felt I was in when I was 19 years old and had graduated from the  <span class="building">university</span>, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: You graduated as a young man? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Young, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: And then what did you decide to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Well, don't forget we were at the tail end of the Depression, and a man in <span class="populated place">New York</span> by the name of Samuel Leidesdorf, a big <span class="building">accounting firm</span>, and a major factor in the <span class="populated place">New York</span>, UJA -- well, it wasn't yet the UJA, it was the Palestine Appeal, said to me I'll give you a job as an accountant for $25.00 a week if you'll go to <span class="building">Columbia Business School</span> and learn accounting. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, okay, $25.00 a week, and so I went to <span class="building">Columbia Graduate School of Business</span>, stayed one year, couldn't stand it for another day, couldn't dream of myself as being an accountant, so I quit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: $25.00 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: A week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: -- was the equivalent today of what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Oh, gosh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="96">30 times that amount, $700.00, $800.00 a week. </sentence><sentence id="97">A very good job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: So it was a nice starting salary? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Oh, yes, a nice starting salary, perfectly acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="104">Tuition was $450.00 at <span class="building">Yale</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">Today it's $23,500.00. </sentence><sentence id="106">So that there I was, I was at the end, I owed money to <span class="building">Yale</span>, I owed money to <span class="populated place">Columbia</span> and it's now 1939, the war has not yet broken out in <span class="country">Europe</span> but it's imminent, and <span class="country">America</span> is in a totally isolationist mood, no thought of participating in it. </sentence><sentence id="107">Roosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making these funny deals called lend/lease, we will lend you some of our <span class="spatial object">destroyers</span> on lease, you will pay us rent for our <span class="spatial object">destroyers</span>, but we're not going to get into your war. </sentence><sentence id="108">So it was really so ambivalent and so confused and so costly in the long run. </sentence><sentence id="109">At any rate my personal requirements were that I had better go and get a job. </sentence><sentence id="110">So I went back to <span class="populated place">New Haven</span> and got a job in a <span class="building">factory</span> working at a <span class="spatial object">sewing machine</span> making blankets. </sentence><sentence id="111">I worked two shifts, 16 hours a day, and I earned enough money to pay back all the debts. </sentence><sentence id="112">And I also did the most important thing at that stage in my life, I decided what I really wanted to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Which was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: I tried to figure out during all those mindless hours at the <span class="spatial object">machine</span> where all you're trying to do is keep your hand away from the needle which you're just feeding cloth through and  it's robot work, and I said why should I continue being so frustrated. </sentence><sentence id="126">If the <span class="building">American Jewish Community</span> isn't awake why don't I try to awaken them, but how do you do that. </sentence><sentence id="127">That's when I decided that I would become a rabbi, not because of any theological sudden insights, I had no epiphanies, I had no -- I conceived of myself really as a civil servant. </sentence><sentence id="128">And if I had a <span class="dlf">platform</span> from which to speak I would use that <span class="spatial object">platform</span> to try to wake people up. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was sort of simplistic, very idealistic, but satisfying to me. </sentence><sentence id="130">On the other hand, again I felt I'm stopping myself for at least three years from getting into any action mode and yet I'd better do that or else I'll be frustrated the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="131">So I finished with the <span class="building">factory</span>, backed off, went to <span class="building">rabbinical seminary</span> with Stephen Wise in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and we did four year's worth of work in three, no summer vacations, no nothing, 11-1/2 months you worked, two weeks off, and kept going that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: What was the mood in <span class="building">rabbinical school</span>, were students preparing for a career, was there a sense of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Well, Wise being the person he was and focused the way he was, every one of the students in the <span class="building">school</span> became acutely sensitized to the current events around us. </sentence><sentence id="142">So, sure, everybody was preparing for a career, you needed to get a <span class="spatial object">pulpit</span> or a job somewhere to earn your living, but the ideology was developing among this group before the <span class="building">school</span> merged with the <span class="building">Hebrew Union College</span> out in <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">It graduated about 220 reform rabbis, but reform rabbis of a totally different kind than <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span> was producing. </sentence><sentence id="144">I sat for all those years next to a fellow by the name of Osher Krishblu- (e or m?) </sentence><sentence id="145">who later became the Chairman of the <span class="building">Misrachi</span>, and he sat with his kippa and I sat without a kippa and the whole faculty liked it that way and Wise liked it that way, and the dean, Henry Slominski liked it that way, it was a <span class="building">school</span> in which "Klal Israel" or pluralism or whatever word you want to use, which is so fashionable today, was really being practiced in the "30s and "40s, the only <span class="building">school</span> in which it was being carried out as a definite ideological objective, and every student picked it up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Tell us a little bit about Stephen Wise, his <span class="building">school</span>, what was his role in this, what was his role in the <span class="populated place">American Jewish Community</span> at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, his role in the <span class="building">American Jewish Community</span> was superb. </sentence><sentence id="154">He was the leader of the protest, the ceaseless effort to try to persuade Roosevelt, to whom he had automatic access, Rabbi Stephen Wise was acceptable to Roosevelt at request, and saw him frequently. </sentence><sentence id="155">He failed to convince him of anything, but Wise was the pusher, Wise was the aggressor seeking to have a large protest meeting in <span class="building">Madison Square Garden</span>, and we'll get 25,000 people there or 20,000 whatever the <span class="building">Garden</span> holds. </sentence><sentence id="156">And he filled it every time, talking about the fact we must do something. </sentence><sentence id="157">He sounded -- he was the only one who sounded the tocsin, the call, he was the bugle. </sentence><sentence id="158">Almost no response except in those of us who were listening to him very very carefully and very closely. </sentence><sentence id="159">I adored him, I admired him, I respected him. </sentence><sentence id="160">The personal impact used to come on Thursday mornings. </sentence><sentence id="161">Thursday morning he had a class called problems of the <span class="building">ministry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">A big round <span class="spatial object">table</span>, <span class="spatial object">seminar table</span>, 18, 12 students around the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">And problems of the <span class="building">ministry</span> or how do you conduct a  wedding how do you conduct a funeral? </sentence><sentence id="164">Nothing of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="165">He would go into his pocket, he would take out the latest telegram that he got from the World Jewish Congress, Riegner in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>, and because he was a key player in the World Jewish Congress he started the American Jewish Congress, he believed in Democracy and he had hoped that those organizations would really be democratic in the sense every member would vote for its officiers. </sentence><sentence id="166">It never happened that way in practice, but in theory it was at that time the most democratic, and still to this day the most liberal organization I think in existence in the panoply of our alphabet soup. </sentence><sentence id="167">So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was the latest stuff going on in <span class="country">Europe</span> in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> or that <span class="populated place">camp,</span> or this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: So you were with him in the period of "39 through -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: "39 to "43. </sentence><sentence id="186">I left in "43. </sentence><sentence id="187">I graduated, I went out to <span class="populated place">Denver</span> to take a -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Did you know of the existence of Riegner telegram? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="194">We students knew it. </sentence><sentence id="195">He read it to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: And what was the its impact? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: On us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Devastating and confirming. </sentence><sentence id="206">It confirmed us in our desire, because I wasn't the only one who felt this frustrated and who wanted to get out there and try to wake up -- so we were getting confirmation to our own personal feelings from him. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I think that if he felt that he was failing to arouse the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">He was succeeding in arousing us. </sentence><sentence id="209">That was, I think, the greater of two contributions which he made. </sentence><sentence id="210">And we were champing at the bit. </sentence><sentence id="211">And so many of us in those classes spent the one year which the Army required for you to go and be an intern, that is by medical metaphor. </sentence><sentence id="212">You graduated <span class="building">medical school</span>, now be an intern in the <span class="building">hospital</span> for a year, and then we will take you into the Army and we'll commission you as a medical officer. </sentence><sentence id="213">The same with clergymen., </sentence><sentence id="214">go out, get your congregational experience, what good that was going to do you in the <span class="building">Army</span> I have no idea, but that was their bureaucracy. </sentence><sentence id="215">And so each of us was impatient to get out, get the congregational job, spend the year and then get into the <span class="building">chaplaincy</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Let me focus for a moment on the Riegner telegram. </sentence><sentence id="228">Do you remember when you heard the Riegner telegram -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, it was in "<span class="populated place">42</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: -- August of "42? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Aug. "42. </sentence><sentence id="235">I didn't remember which month exactly. </sentence><sentence id="236">Well, so then it would have been a week or two weeks thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="237">Remember I said <span class="building">school</span> was continuous, there were no summer vacations. </sentence><sentence id="238">So let's call it -- yes, it was before Rosh Hashanah. </sentence><sentence id="239">Yes I remember it now. </sentence><sentence id="240">So I can't tell you the exact date, but we all used it in sermons that we made. </sentence><sentence id="241">I used it. </sentence><sentence id="242">1remember I used it. </sentence><sentence id="243">But who was listening to us. </sentence><sentence id="244">I mean we didn't make any ripples. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="256">Students make any ripples out in the big <span class="env feature">world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">And if you were a student-Raggi at -- where was I? </sentence><sentence id="258">It was a place in <span class="region">Virginia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">So you're talking to one group of people and you're reading this telegram to them and you're saying wake up, wake up. </sentence><sentence id="260">The impact was quite limited, quite personal. </sentence><sentence id="261">And, you know, the Riegner telegram of 1942 became such a big sensation later as proof that we had evidence and everybody chose to bury it. </sentence><sentence id="262">Wyman in his book talks about the fact that the <span class="building">State Department</span> didn't want it transmitted to anybody, they wanted it just kept secret. </sentence><sentence id="263">They were afraid of what impact it would make and so indeed it didn't make any for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="264">But Wise had it. </sentence><sentence id="265">We his students had it. </sentence><sentence id="266">We tried to get it out. </sentence><sentence id="267">I don't know when it hit the <span class="spatial object">press</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: How did Wise see his own role? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: I don't think he stood still long enough to see his own role. </sentence><sentence id="283">He was in constant motion. </sentence><sentence id="284">He was in furious motion. </sentence><sentence id="285">And the fact that he would meet us every Thursday morning at 11:00 o'clock week after week after week, year after year meant that that was a holy moment for him, a crucial moment. </sentence><sentence id="286">If you can transmit something to your students then at least your mortality becomes less important. </sentence><sentence id="287">If you can't transmit anything to anybody and it's all bottled up in you, then it's dreadful that you are going to die with that. </sentence><sentence id="288">But he never had a sense of dying. </sentence><sentence id="289">He was vigorous and always moving, speaking out ....Listen, he was the prime spokesman to the non Jewish world not just to the Jewish world. </sentence><sentence id="290">In the first half of the 20th century every clergyman in this <span class="country">country</span> knew the name of Stephen Wise. </sentence><sentence id="291">And so his satisfactions came from that. </sentence><sentence id="292">Toward the end he developed cancer in the throat and died in "49 never having set foot on the sovereign soil of the <span class="country">State of Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">At the very end I remember seeing him once and he said that was the greatest tragedy of his life. </sentence><sentence id="294">He spent his whole life working for the cause of Zionism and when it reached its fruition he never had the joy and the glory of setting foot on that <span class="env feature">soil</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Let's go back to "<span class="populated place">42</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: You then finished -- this was the <span class="building">Jewish Institute of Religion</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: <span class="building">Jewish Institute of Religion</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">Later after he died in <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span>, I think it was still Nelson Glick who was the president out there, came and pushed for the merger. </sentence><sentence id="316">Some of us fought against the merger. </sentence><sentence id="317">We had a different conception of what the reform movement was then they did. </sentence><sentence id="318">Rabbi Morton Berman of <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>, I remember, and Rabbi Philip Bernstein of <span class="populated place">Rochester</span>, those were two of my very close friends. </sentence><sentence id="319">They were a few years ahead of me, a few years older than I was, but still we became very friendly. </sentence><sentence id="320">We  fought the merger unsuccessfully, because Wise dead and no fund-raising -- he was the prime fund-raiser, he kept it going. </sentence><sentence id="321">So the merger took place. </sentence><sentence id="322">We scattered. </sentence><sentence id="323">I left. </sentence><sentence id="324">I was graduated and went out to <span class="populated place">Denver</span> in "43. </sentence><sentence id="325">Wise said to me, you go to <span class="populated place">Denver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">Wise used to think that if he could place a man in a <span class="spatial object">pulpit</span> somewhere that he would then have a right to go to that man and to do some fund-raising in that congregation in support of the <span class="building">alma mater</span>, the <span class="building">school</span> you went to. </sentence><sentence id="327">So he was always desperately seeking good congregational placements. </sentence><sentence id="328">Well, this was a <span class="building">congregation</span> out there that had a thousand family memberships in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="329">The congregation was older than the <span class="region">State of Colorado</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330"><span class="region">Colorado</span> came into the Union in 1876. </sentence><sentence id="331"><span class="region">Centennial State</span>, that's the name of the book Centennial that what's his name wrote, Michener. </sentence><sentence id="332">The congregation was 1874. </sentence><sentence id="333">It was started by Simon Guggenheim, later Senator Guggenheim, <span class="building">American Mining and Smelting Company</span>, a powerful, big German classical reform (<span class="building">Temple</span>). </sentence><sentence id="334">So Wise pushed me as, I guess one of his favorite sons, into that congregation. </sentence><sentence id="335">Stay there and we'll always then have a foot in the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: You went out to <span class="populated place">Denver</span>, what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Well, I had a lovely year there, fighting hard with the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="361">Their previous rabbi, also named Friedman, had been there for 50 years and taught then anti-Zionism, anti- Hebrew, anti-Bar Mitzvah, anti-Oriental ceremonials like putting on a hat, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="362">50 years, two generations, I couldn't dream of upsetting that in one year, but I got close to it, split the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="363">I said why don't you guys go off and be homogeneous in your anti-Zionism, I'm going to take this congregation and turn it around. </sentence><sentence id="364">So you're going to be listening to stuff that's going to irritate you, and your presence out there in front is going to irritate me, so take a Safer Torah and goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="365">Today <span class="populated place">Denver</span> has two big, big strong <span class="building">reform temples</span>. </sentence><sentence id="366">The anti group has long since come back. </sentence><sentence id="367">So I think I did a good thing. </sentence><sentence id="368">That was the year. </sentence><sentence id="369">And then I went to the <span class="building">Army</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Let's talk for a little bit about the <span class="building">American Jewish Community</span> at that point from the vantage point of <span class="populated place">Denver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">You've already mentioned one division between Zionism and non Zionism. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: And you've mentioned a second division between an activism that Wise was pushing for in a much more conservative posture of don't rock the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="387">How did you experience the division of the <span class="populated place">Denver Jewish Community</span> during the year 1943 which after all was the height of the holocaust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: I'm not sure what you mean by how did I experience the <span class="region">division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">I exacerbated the division inside the <span class="building">temple</span> by splitting it. </sentence><sentence id="392">And on the basis of this ideological definition of Zionism as being compatible with reformed Judaism, "43 was the crucial year in which the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a vote on the resolution "Is reform  Judaism compatible with Zionism." </sentence><sentence id="393">That's the way the resolution was framed and the votes were taken, role call vote name by name by name by name. </sentence><sentence id="394">You had to stand up, it was not a secret ballot. </sentence><sentence id="395">The vote was three to one in favor of that resolution. </sentence><sentence id="396">Yes, these two ideologies are perfectly compatible, three to one, 300 to 100. </sentence><sentence id="397">And the 100 guys went off and formed the American Council for Judaism, the anti-Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="398">The 300 guys controlled the future growth of the reform movement. </sentence><sentence id="399">But it wasn't only on the Zionist issue, it was on the issue of ritual. </sentence><sentence id="400">What is a Bar Mitzvah? </sentence><sentence id="401">What a silly, stupid thing. </sentence><sentence id="402">That boy isn't a man at the age of 13. </sentence><sentence id="403">We do not have Bar Mitzvahs. </sentence><sentence id="404">Well, and that was the practice out in <span class="populated place">Cincinnati</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">That's the way those graduates were being taught. </sentence><sentence id="406">Our graduates were pushing greater ritual observance, so we were accused of being Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="407">Well, on order to validate that accusation which I thought was the ironic way to handle the whole thing, my best friend in <span class="populated place">town</span> was a Rabbi Manuel Lederman who was the Orthodox rabbi in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">It used to delight my supporters when they would see the two of us walking down the <span class="dlf">street</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="409">It used to infuriate my enemies and gave them visible proof that I was a traitor to the reform movement. </sentence><sentence id="410">We were friends all our lives. </sentence><sentence id="411">And his son, Paul, who lives in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> now, I still see once in a while. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: In <span class="populated place">Denver</span> was there a move for political activism at that point on behalf of the European Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="436"> A No, there was a move on behalf of Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="437">You know the accusation which is made against Ben Gurion himself and all the Palestinian-centered Zionist officials, that they didn't pay much attention to the holocaust, they didn't express their outrage at it, they didn't do very much except the <span class="building">Haganah</span>, the military arm of the Jewish agency which tried to do something about it because, and these are the theories, because the Zionist leaders felt that the battle over saving Jewish life in <span class="country">Europe</span> was lost, but that the battle for creating a state which would harbor whoever would be left alive had yet to be won. </sentence><sentence id="438">So of the two battles, why fight the one which is already hopeless, you must fight the one which contains the hope for the future. </sentence><sentence id="439">Now that was pretty much Ben Gurion's philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="440">We talked about it many times and he wasn't cold, he wasn't calloused, his heart was as wounded as everybody's was, but he was a terribly practical and pragmatic person. </sentence><sentence id="441">And so he said I've got to concentrate on Zionism and building the <span class="populated place">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">I want a Jewish army. </sentence><sentence id="443">He was fighting for that as part of the Allied armies in order to stake a claim afterwards to be able to sit at the <span class="spatial object">peace table</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: Well because the fight was there. </sentence><sentence id="481">I mean the point is that I could continue trying to argue with these Jews in <span class="populated place">Denver</span>, and I made tremendous strides with them and I knew I would win the fight or history would win the fight, not I, but I wanted to be where the history was. </sentence><sentence id="482">So 365 days to the day, like the prisoner scratches the nail on the <span class="dlf">cement wall</span> of the <span class="interior space">cell</span> when the calendar -- and my old friend Rabbi Bernstein, Phil Bernstein, was the Executive Secretary of the Chaplaincy Commission of the Jewish Welfare Board, which certified to the Army that this rabbi yes indeed is sane and etcetera and we recommend that you take him and commission him First Lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="483">I think it was $1,000.00 a month. </sentence><sentence id="484">That was better than the $25.00, which was the last offer I had. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: April 29th, okay. </sentence><sentence id="637">It's good to have a real expert here. </sentence><sentence id="638">Now, the first encounter I had with refugees was shortly thereafter, some matter of days or weeks. </sentence><sentence id="639">From <span class="populated place">Munich</span> south, all through <span class="region">Bavaria</span> were a whole network of underground <span class="building">German factories</span> that were producing goods for the Army, everything from simple bullets to very complicated Howitzers. </sentence><sentence id="640">It was all done with slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="641">These people emerged. </sentence><sentence id="642">They were wondering around the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and <span class="env feature">forests</span> and the <span class="env feature">lakes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">It's heavily <span class="region">wooded area</span>, and heavily infiltrated with lots of small <span class="env feature">lakes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="644">I used to take <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> out of the motor pool, <span class="building">9th Division motor pool</span> and start driving on these small <span class="dlf">country roads</span> looking for people and determining that they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="645">The process is very simple, you just drop their trousers and that's that. </sentence><sentence id="646">And putting them into the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and trying to find a place where I could gather them and (a) let them be safe, and (b) get some food in and get some DDT powder and get some simple medicines. </sentence><sentence id="647">Penicillin had just been invented but it was ferociously expensive and available only for syphilis. </sentence><sentence id="648">That's when I first encountered them. </sentence><sentence id="649">And I remember an episode where we were driving down and we had about a half a load of people and we saw two children on the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, this just remains locked in my head, and I jumped out and I wanted to talk to the children. </sentence><sentence id="650">You talk to them in a combination of German or Yiddish or Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="651">You find one of those three languages would work. </sentence><sentence id="652">But the kids were frightened. </sentence><sentence id="653">They saw a soldier in a uniform and they started to run across the <span class="dlf">field</span> and it's a little boy and a little girl, and they're holding hands and they're running and they're stumbling. </sentence><sentence id="654">And I didn't want to threaten them by running faster than they were, so I kind of followed them and they were gasping and they were crying, and finally they ran out of steam and they stopped, and so I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="655">After I got my arms around them and I tried to explain to them and I pointed to the chaplain's insignia on the uniform which was a little Ten Commandments thing and they quieted down. </sentence><sentence id="656">I scooped up the two kids, they were about 10 or 11 years old, and I scooped up the kids and put them in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="657">But the fear was so palpable. </sentence><sentence id="658">And whatever experience they had been through was so utterly real that they were shocked out of any knowledge of their own names, where they came from, what they were doing there. </sentence><sentence id="659">I mean it was like total amnesia. </sentence><sentence id="660">And there was obviously already a medical condition; they could not remember their own names. </sentence><sentence id="661">It was the anonymity of those two survivors, they didn't  know who they were, what happened to them, where they came from that really impacted me. </sentence><sentence id="662">Because I don't understand the six million and I don't understand the one and a half million children or whatever the number is, but two children that's real, that's real. </sentence><sentence id="663">And I said to myself, every single one such we have to try to save and rescue. </sentence><sentence id="664">What's dead is dead. </sentence><sentence id="665">It's all gone. </sentence><sentence id="666">It's ashes, and it's blown off in the wind. </sentence><sentence id="667">But what's living we can't leave them wondering around <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">And that's what I did for the next two and a half years. </sentence><sentence id="669">So I still remember it. </sentence><sentence id="670">So that was the first encounter. </sentence><sentence id="671">And when you would get a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> full of 50 people, then the trick is to find some <span class="building">structure</span> with four <span class="dlf">walls</span> and a <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="672">So I remember once we would find a <span class="building">barn</span> that had three <span class="dlf">walls</span>, and you would find an abandoned <span class="dlf">airfield</span> with a <span class="building">hangar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">You would find something. </sentence><sentence id="674">I remember once I found a <span class="building">city hall</span> in a small <span class="populated place">German town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">It was a beautiful <span class="building">building</span> in perfect shape, fully occupied by German clerks, all busy working at the <span class="spatial object">typewriters</span>, and I said hey this is a great <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="676">Well, a <span class="spatial object">Colt .45</span> is a heavy piece of equipment. </sentence><sentence id="677">You turn it around and hit the butt on the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and you can break the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">So a few knocks like that got the attention of the <span class="building">Burgermeister</span>. </sentence><sentence id="679">It was a <span class="building">city hall</span> so he's there, <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, <span class="interior space">second floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="680">And in nice German I told him this <span class="building">house</span> was now beschlagnamt, this was requisitioned in the name of the United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="681">I had no more authority to do that than you do, than you would have, but the uniform was its own authority and the .45 was it's own authority. </sentence><sentence id="682">So that, okay, I want this place empty and I want it "sauber" and clean and I want it ready tomorrow morning and everybody out I am bringing in some "Fluechtlinge," refugees. </sentence><sentence id="683">He doesn't have to know who they are. </sentence><sentence id="684">And, you know, sure enough tomorrow morning it was clean, it was empty, it was available, it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="685">He had some wood in the back for a <span class="spatial object">wood stove</span>, and 50 Jews had -- now, this is called a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="686">I mean you've got to designate it. </sentence><sentence id="687">You've got a location for it, you give it a name, it's got a population. </sentence><sentence id="688">And to cut a long story short by the time we got all through there were 64 locations in <span class="country">Germany</span>, another six or eight in <span class="country">Austria</span>, and even two in <span class="country">Italy</span>, all where the American Army was housing quarter of a million people. </sentence><sentence id="689">The starting number that I was aware of when <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> was liberated, that were a few months earlier, was 35,000 Jews alive on German soil either in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, liberated from <span class="populated place">camps</span> or from slave labor in <span class="building">German factories</span>, 35,000. </sentence><sentence id="690">That number was determined by a fellow named Abraham Klausner, a chaplain who was with the forces that got into <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> right after the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1944">A: He received permission to come into <span class="country">Germany</span> to visit and work in the <span class="building">Offenbach depot</span> of approximately 3,000,000 volumes which Rosenberg had collected. </sentence><sentence id="1945">The intent of which was to form a basic library of Judaica which German scholars would study and find in the very Jewish sources the words with which to condemn the Jewish people as being parasites and destroyers and anti-Christ and everything else so that you would condemn the Jewish people out of their very own mouths. </sentence><sentence id="1946">What came out of their mouths would condemn them. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But somebody had to find it and collate it and synthesize it into one simple <span class="interior space">volume</span> that then would become the property of every single decent person on earth. </sentence><sentence id="1948">And after we have killed their bodies we will then also kill their soul and their spirit. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So this was the intention of Alfred Rosenberg and this was the process. </sentence><sentence id="1950">Now, what was collected, literally actually collected physically, in that <span class="building">warehouse</span> were mostly claye kodesh and repetitious forms of the same prayer book in different languages. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1958">Q: By claye kodesh" you mean the holy books? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1960">A: Holy books, the holy books. </sentence><sentence id="1961">But among that mass of 3 million fairly unimportant volumes, from his point of view, there were 1,300 priceless incunabula, manuscripts handwritten from early Middle Ages and Scholem worked for 90 days like a beaver, slept in that same <span class="building">warehouse</span>, sorting out 3 million volumes and had these 1,300 precious, priceless, irreplaceable items set aside. </sentence><sentence id="1962">He packed them into five large wooden <span class="spatial object">packing crates</span>, each five feet by five feet, not impossible to handle, not gigantic, and labeled them. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And that's where the fear started. </sentence><sentence id="1964">Because a couple of days before his time ran out he came to me and he said what are we going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1965">I have applied for permission to take * "<span class="spatial object">Claye Kodesh</span>" are literally holy utensils. </sentence><sentence id="1966"> these to the <span class="building">Hebrew University</span>, the <span class="building">monuments</span> and <span class="building">fine arts section</span> of military government in <span class="country">Germany</span> of the American Army, monuments and <span class="building">fine arts section</span>, has refused me permission. </sentence><sentence id="1967">They're the ones who allowed me to come and do the sorting. </sentence><sentence id="1968">They now refuse me permission to take these to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And at first they wouldn't give me an explanation for that refusal, and then I finally pushed and I got it, and the explanation was that there is a <span class="building">rabbinical seminary</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I'm not sure of the name of it, I think it's the <span class="building">Theological Seminary</span> which says that there is no reason why all of these precious things should go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1970">All of them or some of them should be placed in our <span class="building">library</span>, the greatest <span class="building">Jewish library</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, the greatest Jewish population in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1971">This is a clear reflection of the absolutely indifferent or neutral, I don't want to say anti-Zionist position of the <span class="building">seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1972">I don't even want to say the whole conservative movement in 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And I state this publicly and it can be interpreted as a condemnation. </sentence><sentence id="1974">I'm not trying to condemn anybody, I'm trying to say that they had a letter from the chancellor saying, and that had to be I think at that time, Finkelstein, that the Army should not allow, they should not send all these documents to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1975">They had been collected from all the locations in <span class="country">Europe</span> whose descendants are either dead or have migrated to the <span class="region">new world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1976">So that was their sort of cool, cold objective reasoning. </sentence><sentence id="1977">The Army didn't want to get into an internecine Jewish fight so it put a hold on it. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And he was distraught because his time was up, could not be renewed, and he didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1979">Here he's got the stuff in five <span class="spatial object">packing cases</span> and what does he do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1980">Again you have to make a decision at a certain moment in time and you make it, and I said Professor, go <span class="building">home</span>, relax, don't worry about it, I'll steal them, I'll get them out of the <span class="building">warehouse</span> and I'll get them to you, and don't ask me how because I don't know yet myself. </sentence><sentence id="1981">I was sorry that he had labeled them because what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span> at the time was a very active <span class="building">black market</span> in pages of Beethoven and pages of Mozart, and one page was bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Much later on when the story finally broke on the front page of the Stars and Stripes, and I can show you the issue which I have kept to this day, it listed the value of this treasure as $5 million. </sentence><sentence id="1983">He went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1984">What I did very simply was on New Years Eve when it everybody was off duty or drunk I took a <span class="spatial object">JDC ambulance</span>, drove it to the back <span class="dlf">loading dock</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1985">There was a Jewish captain in command of the <span

other way, I'm going to sign for these as though I am a man by the name of Koppel Pinson who was no longer in <span class="country">Germany</span>, he had gone <span class="building">home</span> four

id="2110">I'm not going to argue with you about that, but leave it there, don't move it. </sentence><sentence id="2111">So he looks at me, he said yes possession is 9/10ths of the law isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="2112">Once it's there it's there, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="2113">I said, sir, don't get me into that discussion. </sentence><sentence id="2114">So we immediately we had an understanding. </sentence><sentence id="2115">So he said okay, it's a very reasonable suggestion. </sentence><sentence id="2116">So ordered, and I will so organize it. </sentence><sentence id="2117">Now, what do we do about you? </sentence><sentence id="2118">I mean this is a long answer to your question about what provoked my leaving the scene. </sentence><sentence id="2119">He picked up the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>, called head of the CID, said I want you to kill the court marshall, that's out and over, I'm sending this officer back to the <span

as far as the Army overseas. </sentence><sentence id="2121">The <span class="country">United States</span> is the <span class="interior space">interior</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2122">So this officer is being dismissed from my command and will be discharged from the Army and so you lull the court marshall. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Finished just like that. </sentence><sentence id="2124">And he came back from the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> and he said, and the <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> will remain there, are you happy, he said. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Perfectly satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="2126">Now, it's between Scholem and your surrogate, whoever your person is over there in charge, and I'm satisfied that it will work out the way we hope it will. </sentence><sentence id="2127">So I was given orders to go back and be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="2128">That story ended. </sentence><sentence id="2129">I went to <span class="populated place">Fort Dix</span> in <span class="region">New Jersey</span> and the customary procedure there is that when you're being discharged they ask you a bunch of questions, have you returned your gas mask, have you returned your rifle, blah, blah, blah. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And one of the questions is, do you wish to remain in the United States

I need you to go around with me making speeches in <span class="country">America</span> and you've got stories to tell that will help raise a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="2137">And I said but I have to go to <span class="populated place">Fort Dix</span> and be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And  he said well, I'll call the Secretary of War and I said no, sir, call the 1st sergeant at the <span class="building">separation center</span> and he said I don't deal with sergeants, I deal with cabinet members. </sentence><sentence id="2139">So I said well then get something in writing. </sentence><sentence id="2140">He did indeed call Secretary of War Patterson, who told them over the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> yes you want to keep this man with you 30 days, absolutely, in uniform on detached service to you, I'll write the orders. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I never got a copy of the orders, <span class="populated place">Fort Dix</span> never got a copy of the orders. </sentence><sentence id="2142">I had gone back 30 days later and I'm arrested at the <span class="dlf">gate</span> for being AWOL, absent without leave, and the Chaplain of all

id="2144">And then the commanding officer, general somebody, was told by Morgenthau yes I had the man on duty with me and I will get you a telex from Secretary Patterson and you'll have it in ten minutes, this guy came back to me in the <span class="interior space">cell</span>, he gives me a cigar and he says don't hold anything against me. </sentence><sentence id="2145">I said come on, come on, you don't think I know the racket well enough. </sentence><sentence id="2146">No, of course it's not against you, it's against stupid Mr. Secretary Morgenthau, he didn't get me anything in writing, the Army goes by what's on paper. </sentence><sentence id="2147">The end of the story in <span class="country">Israel</span>, in <span class="country">Palestine</span> was the American guy

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2320">Q: Let me touch on two issues we haven't touched on, on the European experience. </sentence><sentence id="2321">What was the attitude of the DP population toward the Germans, and what was it like for them to live in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2322">And let's start with that for a moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2326">A: It's really a serious question and it's easily answered. </sentence><sentence id="2327">The DPs lived mostly in <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2328">There were no machine guns aimed at them and there were no guards at the <span class="dlf">gates</span>, but they were in an <span class="region">encircled area</span>, they were in a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2329">A few of them were out and were living freely in <span class="interior space">rented quarters</span> among the German population, they were comfortable doing that, but 99 percent were in <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2330">They used to look through the <span class="dlf">wire</span> around the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and they used to see Germans going on <span class="spatial object">buses</span>, carrying little <span class="spatial object">briefcases</span>, going to work. </sentence><sentence id="2331">The <span class="populated place">town</span> was working and everybody was living a normal existence except they. </sentence><sentence id="2332">They hated the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2333">They resented them. </sentence><sentence id="2334">They didn't envy them. </sentence><sentence id="2335">They just would like to have torn every German apart if they could get their hands on them. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Now, they could because as I said they were not confined, they went out into the <span class="populated place">towns</span> near which these <span class="populated place">camps</span> were located. </sentence><sentence id="2337">They bought goods in the <span class="building">German stores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2338">They learned to speak German, many of them did. </sentence><sentence id="2339">But you could see the look in their eye and they hated every German. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Every once in a while some episode would flare up and you would see the expression of it in a physical form of rebellion. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And I'll just tell you one story which illustrates many many similar things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="2342">It was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> at <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2343"><span class="populated place">Landsberg</span> was the <span class="populated place">town</span> where Hitler was in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2344">In that very same <span class="building">German Army barracks</span> in which he was imprisoned in 1925, yes, "24,"25 when he wrote "Mein Kampf," are now living Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="2345">So you can imagine what an irony that was. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Okay, in this <span class="populated place">camp</span> at <span class="populated place">Landsburg</span> one day a rumor spread through the <span class="populated place">camp</span> that a Jewish child had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2347">Immediately a riot started through the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and a wave rushed out of <span class="dlf">gates</span> of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> into <span class="populated place">town</span> and started to break <span class="dlf">store windows</span>, start <span class="building">buildings</span> on fire, over-turned <span class="spatial object">buses</span>, attack and pummel any German passerby, quickly the <span class="populated place">town</span> turned into an <span class="populated place">armed camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2348">The purpose of the <span class="building">Army</span> was to keep law and order. </sentence><sentence id="2349">Here it was breaking down between Jews and Germans, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2350">That's dynamite, that's incendiary. </sentence><sentence id="2351">So the Army pushed the Jews back into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and  closed the <span class="dlf">gates</span> and padlocked them. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Okay, now you have U.S. troops ringed around and a couple of 50 caliber machine guns are brought and set up and a <span class="spatial object">tank</span> is hovering delicately in the background but present, visibly present. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And so the Jews start yelling "Amerikanische SS, you American soldiers are acting like the SS. </sentence><sentence id="2354">Amerikanische Nazis." </sentence><sentence id="2355">Well, now the lieutenant in charge of this platoon says whoa, whoa, we're not Nazis and we're not here to hurt you, but you can't come and tear and <span class="populated place">town</span>, and the dialogue goes and the Jews boom!, </sentence><sentence id="2356">burst out of the padlocked <span class="populated place">camp</span> once more and break the <span class="dlf">gates</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2357">Then the scuffle starts between American troops and Jewish DPs and Germans ringing around looking at it with great pleasure, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2390">Q: Now you guys have your Jewish problems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2392">A: 19 young fellows get arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2393">They were the ones at the front. </sentence><sentence id="2394">So they were the activists, and one of them has a knife in his pocket. </sentence><sentence id="2395">Later when they're arrested and they are brought into the <span class="building">police station</span> and one of them has got a piece of lead pipe in his pocket, and one of them has got a hammer in his pocket, and anything that could be used as a weapon, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2396">So they are charged with, I don't know what the technicality of the charge is, but it's disturbing the peace and it's inciting to riot, and nobody was murdered and nobody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="2397">By then incidently it is discovered that the little boy who was missing was not dead, that there was a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the <span class="dlf">fence</span> at the back of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> going right into the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and he had gone out there and he had wanted to do whatever, maybe he wanted to smoke a cigarette, nobody knows, but nothing had happened to the kid and the kid had came back in. </sentence><sentence id="2398">And so the whole rumor that had started the whole thing was of course inaccurate. </sentence><sentence id="2399">But by now you've got 19 fellows in the <span class="building">stockade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2400">Word of this gets back to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2401">There was a Congressman from <span class="region">Illinois</span> by the name of Adolph Sabboth, an old guy, he was about 80 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2402">He informed the press and the Department of War that he intended to go to <span class="country">Germany</span> and himself make sure that these Jews got an honest and fair treatment from the American Army and the American Army wasn't going to treat them like the Nazis did. </sentence><sentence id="2403">And he's shaking his fist in everybody's face. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And of course word of this gets back to General Clay and this is exactly what he needs his advisor for, so General Clay says to me you go down to -- Bernstein says to me you go down to <span class="populated place">Landsburg</span>, you sort this thing out, you make sure that these guys get a proper defense. </sentence><sentence id="2405">They're in front of a court marshall of seven officers, so it's going to have to be a military officer who will have to defend them and there will be a military prosecutor, and I want you there as my personal representative. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And you have all of my authority and you report to the commanding general that you are there on my behalf so he knows who you are and you follow this thing every step of the way because this is dynamite. </sentence><sentence id="2407">Okay, the end of the story very quickly, I went to the Judge Advocate General and I asked him for the best lawyer he had in the United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And he tells me that guy who handles all death sentences given by courts marshall for murder, rape, all the felony one kind is a captain by the name of Abraham Heimann, and I say fine, I want him. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Heimann said if I get mixed up in this <span class="building">DP business</span> I'll never get <span class="building">home</span> for five years. </sentence><sentence id="2410">I'm due to be demobilized. </sentence><sentence id="2411">I said Abe, come on, come on, come on. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And to make a long story short he came on and he came down and he was the defense attorney and he  defended them as well as he could and brilliantly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2434">Q: And he didn't get <span class="building">home</span> for five years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2436">A: He did not. </sentence><sentence id="2437">He wound up as the last, the final advisor when <span class="populated place">Ferinwald</span>?, </sentence><sentence id="2438">the final <span class="populated place">camp</span>, closed in 1950 Heimann, the last advisor, went <span class="building">home</span> finally in 1950. </sentence><sentence id="2439">So anyhow, the trial ended. </sentence><sentence id="2440">They were given three months which was, you know, the admonitory slap on the wrist with time off for good behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2441">So they probably might have served, you know, three weeks, four weeks, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2442">However, Heimann pleaded and obtained for the right that they should not be put in a <span class="building">prison</span> with Germans, they should not be put in a <span class="building">prison</span> with American soldiers in the <span class="building">stockade</span>, they should be put in some separate place where the Army can have a few guards and watch over them. </sentence><sentence id="2443">And we find an old abandoned <span class="building">castle</span> nearby, quite nearby, so their families could come and visit them, and within four weeks we had all 19 of them out and on their way through the Aliyah Bet and they were taken off <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> to a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to <span class="country">Palestine</span> and that was the end of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2452">Q: Let's touch on one more question which is really more a historical question, but also part of your own experience. </sentence><sentence id="2453">July 4th 1946-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: Oh, <span class="populated place">Kielce</span>, the <span class="building">Kielce Pogrom</span>, is that the one you're referring to? </sentence><sentence id="2457">Oh, that was a bitter one, bitter, bitter, bitter. </sentence><sentence id="2458">42 Jews were killed that day and the bodies were laid around the <span

were like cord wood in a circle around the <span class="dlf">fountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2459">A ripple went through all of Europe, and of course it reached <span

caused it, find out what it's implications are, and what the consequences might be, if any, for us here in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2461">Because he knew, he was

</sentence><sentence id="2471">It's not an American problem, it's not an <span class="building">embassy</span> problem, it doesn't involve anything, it doesn't involve a consular division, it doesn't involve reparations, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And probably whatever happened to them they damn well deserved. </sentence><sentence id="2473">That was his parting shot. </sentence><sentence id="2474">Thank you, sir, Mr. Ambassador, very much. </sentence><sentence id="2475">We went to see the Prime Minister, Mr. Edward Losupka Morafska. </sentence><sentence id="2476">Quite bland. </sentence><sentence id="2477">I really, you know, there is some latent anti-semitism among the Polish people, everybody knows that, that's historic fact, I don't know what triggered if off, I don't know what caused it, but it will die down the way it always does. </sentence><sentence id="2478">And I mean there is nothing that the Polish government will or can or should do about there. </sentence><sentence id="2479">There  are no culprits, we can't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2480">We go to see the Cardinal, Augustus Cardinal Hlond, H-L-O-N-D, a bull-necked, cropped hair, tough as nails. </sentence><sentence id="2481">He never asked us to sit down, the whole interview was standing. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And his attitude was very simple, these Jews brought Communism here. </sentence><sentence id="2483">The head of the Communist party running this <span class="country">country</span> is a Jew by the name of Yacob Berman. </sentence><sentence id="2484">Whatever the Polish people of the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Kelts</span> did to those Jews they did out of anger and fury and rage because the Jews have put this anchor around our necks. </sentence><sentence id="2485">And the <span class="building">church</span> will do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2486">We tried and we asked him if he would write a pastoral letter which should be read in every <span class="building">church</span> and this would kind of put a blanket on the -- he wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2487">So our fourth visit we went to Mr. Berman, and Yacob Berman says if the Jews are guilty of having brought Communism here to <span class="country">Poland</span> it's the best thing that we could ever do for this <span class="country">country</span> and I will take whatever consequences. </sentence><sentence id="2488">And furthermore, if the consequences are that a few Jews get killed, well a few Jews get killed. </sentence><sentence id="2489">It's just a few more. </sentence><sentence id="2490">We are fighting for a whole new world. </sentence><sentence id="2491">And he was a Communist idealogue and he believed it and he preached it. </sentence><sentence id="2492">And we're fighting for a whole new world means for everybody and for a larger number of Jews, and even if there were a few casualties there always are in war. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And the last point I want to make with you gentlemen is that they should remain here. </sentence><sentence id="2494">If you came from <span class="country">Germany</span> from the American commander to find out if the Jews here are going to flee, if | have anything to do I will see to it that they will leave this <span class="country">country</span> nakt und barfuss, they will go out naked and barefoot because they shouldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="2495">Well, you know, this was zero for four. </sentence><sentence id="2496">We had seen four people, the Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal, and then the Communist leader, and you get no sympathy from any of them. </sentence><sentence id="2497">But then when we started to go around and we began to talk to the Haganah guys who were working in the <span class="populated place">towns</span> and we began to talk to ordinary Jews whom we were recommended to, we got the picture that they're packing and leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2498">And we returned and we wrote the report to McNarney that he could expect, that the <span class="building">military command</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> could expect over the period of the next year to a year and a half approximately 150,000 people to come flooding in from the <span class="region">east</span> to the <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And the Army had better gear up for it and prepare it, and the Army would have a political decision to make, not a military one as to whether the <span class="dlf">borders</span> should be closed or opened. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And if you want to close the <span class="dlf">borders</span> and you want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in then you're going to have to do it by armed force or setting up barriers and blockades. </sentence><sentence id="2501">McNarney looked at that and he said well, whoa, this is way over my head. </sentence><sentence id="2502">Bernstein, go to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> please and talk to the President. </sentence><sentence id="2503">A decision about whether the <span class="dlf">border</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span> is open or closed to 150,000 refugees is not for me to make. </sentence><sentence id="2504">So Phil did, he flew to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> and talked to Truman. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2505">It took about 15 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="2506">He got an immediate green light, and he came back. </sentence><sentence id="2507">Okay, <span class="populated place">McNarney</span> has got a green light from the President, the <span class="dlf">borders</span> are open. </sentence><sentence id="2508">So <span class="populated place">Lippman</span> is on the <span class="dlf">Czechoslovak border</span> and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the <span class="dlf">borders</span> are all manned with our people and that is what raised the ultimate total to 250,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="2509">It's just as simple as that. </sentence><sentence id="2510">That was the final result of the <span class="populated place">Kielce</span> Pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="2511">Those 42 victims triggered off a major demographic shift. </sentence><sentence id="2512">And the accumulation of that many people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> itself had the political influence plus the episode of the Exodus to produce that vote in the <span class="building">United Nations</span> in November of "47. </sentence><sentence id="2513">By November of "47 everything is falling into place. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2514">Q: Let me push this phase to the close by asking a question. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Where were you on May 14th 1948, or where were you on November 29th "47? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2516">A: I don't remember the latter date where I was. </sentence><sentence id="2517">I was probably -- no, I was still in <span class="populated place">Denver</span> in "47. </sentence><sentence id="2518">Of course, I was still in <span class="populated place">Denver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2519">I was in <span class="populated place">Denver</span> November 29th "47. </sentence><sentence id="2520">May 15th "48 I was shuttling between <span class="populated place">Denver</span>, <span class="populated place">New York</span> and <span class="populated place">Wilmington</span>, <span class="region">Delaware</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2521"><span class="populated place">Wilmington</span>, <span class="region">Delaware</span> had to do with <span class="populated place">DuPont</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2522"><span class="populated place">New York</span> had to do with the <span class="building">Haganah headquarters</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span> which was in a <span class="building">hotel</span>, <span class="dlf">14th East 60th Street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2523">Next <span class="dlf">door</span> to the <span class="building">Copacabana nightclub</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2524">The director of the <span class="building">Haganah</span> in the <span class="country">United States</span> was Mr. Teddy Kollek, now the Mayor of <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, a world famous figure. </sentence><sentence id="2525">So Teddy had ordered me when I returned to the <span class="country">States</span>, he reminded me that I was still in the <span class="building">Haganah</span> and never mind I was running around making speeches for the UJA, that's kid stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2526">As far as the Haganah is concerned it's real stuff, and he wanted me to, contrary to the embargo laws of the <span class="country">United States</span> Government, to buy, pack, ship out of the <span class="country">United States</span> all the dynamite, brick production, of DuPont. </sentence><sentence id="2527">A brick is a brick, the size of a brick, the size and shape of a brick, but this brick is a piece of dynamite. </sentence><sentence id="2528">Now you take three of them, stack them up one on top of each other, and take three more, one on top of each other, and wire the six of them together and attach the wire, whatever length you want, to a detonator and you blow up that package, we called it a satchel charge because you took the six bricks, put them inside of a <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span>, you know, a canvas <span class="spatial object">GI knapsack</span>, it looked like a little <span class="spatial object">satchel</span>, it should have been called a <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> charge more accurately, and it will blow a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in a <span class="dlf">stone wall</span> or it will blow a <span class="dlf">hole</span> through an <span class="dlf">iron gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And that was the main <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> that the Israel Armed Forces had. </sentence><sentence id="2530">It didn't have any big <span class="spatial object">artillery</span>, it didn't have mortars, Howitzers. </sentence><sentence id="2531">So I was buying the dynamite, shipping it to myself in <span class="populated place">Denver</span>, trans- shipping it down to <span class="populated place">Tampico</span> in <span class="country">Mexico</span>, buying <span class="spatial object">vessels</span>, getting the stuff on board in cardboard cartons that said "Del Monte peaches, fruit salad, pineapples." </sentence><sentence id="2532">We stole the cartons from <span class="populated place">Del Monte</span>, <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2533">And the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were manifested to the <span class="region">Far East</span>, but when they went out of <span class="populated place">Tampico</span> they didn't turn and go through the <span class="dlf">canal</span> to the <span class="region">Far East</span>, they went to the <span class="region">Mid East</span>, in the other direction. </sentence><sentence id="2534">So that's where I was all through "48. " </sentence><sentence id="2535">48 was a hell of a year with me and the <span class="building">FBI</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2536">But everything came out okay. </sentence><sentence id="2537">No charges, no nothing, and a happy ending to the story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2560">Q: Herb, is there anything we haven't touched? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2562">A: No, Michael. </sentence><sentence id="2563">No, I think we've covered the main things. </sentence><sentence id="2564">But the summary of the whole business is that you had a population that had the patience and the stamina to overcome all of the evil and the agony they had been through, all the losses they had suffered, and who had the hope and the faith in something they believed in that represented their future. </sentence><sentence id="2565">So the patience and the stamina, the faith and hope characterized that DP population. </sentence><sentence id="2566">With all the hatred boiling in them, with all of the stuff that many of them have never gotten out of their systems for their whole lives, that's one element. </sentence><sentence id="2567">Then you've got the other supporting elements. </sentence><sentence id="2568">You've got the group, you've got the United States Army, benevolent, friendly, cooperative. </sentence><sentence id="2569">I can't compliment them enough. </sentence><sentence id="2570">Number  two, you've got the group of American Jewish organizations that came in with dough and support. </sentence><sentence id="2571">Number three, you've got the Israelis, the Palestinian personalities beginning with Ben Gurion himself and the whole mechanism of the Haganah and their support that they provided. </sentence><sentence id="2572">And then lastly you have won over world public opinion so that you get that great ringing majority vote of two when the resolution was finally passed in November of "47. </sentence><sentence id="2573">It won by two. </sentence><sentence id="2574">The two <span class="country">countries</span> were the <span class="country">Philippines</span> and <span class="country">Guatemala</span>, great big Democratic powers that pushed the <span class="spatial object">ball</span> over the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2575">But that was the combination. </sentence><sentence id="2576">Now, we've talked about the DPs themselves and we've talked about the Army and we've talked about the JDC and the great organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2577">We've talked about the <span class="building">Haganah</span> and the Israelis. </sentence><sentence id="2578">The world conscieuce, feeble as it was, did its trick and the <span class="region">State</span> was created. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and where I am now and what did it all mean, I really believe the following statement, and it may sound strange to you, those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948 when the State was established, those three years I think are the single group of any three years in the entire history of the Jewish people, and I mean every single thing I can think of that we've been through since Abraham, I don't think there is another period of three years which has ever been so determinative. </sentence><sentence id="2580">Because we came out of the death into the life and those are the two extremes, death and life. </sentence><sentence id="2581">There aren't any others. </sentence><sentence id="2582">There is nothing similar. </sentence><sentence id="2583">Persecution and inquisition of this one or that one, or running from one <span class="country">country</span>, running from another <span class="country">country</span>, that's all blips on the <span class="spatial object">screen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2584">But this is the definitive thing. </sentence><sentence id="2585">We could have passed off the stage of history. </sentence><sentence id="2586">There's no doubt in my mind about it. </sentence><sentence id="2587">One third of the people dead in <span class="country">Europe</span>, one third of the people paralyzed and ineffective in <span class="country">America</span> during the crucial years, almost another third of the people lost behind the <span class="region">Iron Curtain</span>, you couldn't get to them, they couldn't be useful or helpful. </sentence><sentence id="2588">The Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably. </sentence><sentence id="2589">And out of that three short years later you find you're back into vibrancy and action and you're winning a war. </sentence><sentence id="2590">That's a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2591">I don't know any other miracle, and I'm even talking about the crossing of the <span class="env feature">Red Sea</span>, and I'm talking about anything else you want to mention, I don't know of anything else that's comparable to it. </sentence><sentence id="2592">So if I had the zekhut, the merit, to live through those three years, work my way through those three years, add something, well then it was a life worth living. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And that's how I sum it up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
