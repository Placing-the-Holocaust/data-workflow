<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: What did you know about Hitler and the rise of Nazism before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. </sentence><sentence id="24">My father used to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="25">However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things. </sentence><sentence id="26">They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="27">In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from <span class="country">Germany</span>, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="28">They really went from <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="populated place">city</span> amongst Jews. </sentence><sentence id="29">There were so many of them that people had to help. </sentence><sentence id="30">So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: They told stories of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Definitely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="42">In a <span class="building">public school</span>, since it was more or less a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="43">He was not Polish, the guy who was running the <span class="building">school</span>, he was not Jewish, he was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="44">In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the <span class="populated place">city</span> very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span> might come to your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">It was known between people that he's not going to stop at that time in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. </sentence><sentence id="54">So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later. </sentence><sentence id="55">A few days before the war they already had black outs in <span class="country">Poland</span>, because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was  about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. </sentence><sentence id="57">We did not know the particulars of what they signed. </sentence><sentence id="58">The Germans, the <span class="country">USSR</span>, we anticipated there would be a war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Was there anything that the <span class="populated place">community</span> did in preparation for this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="70">The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. </sentence><sentence id="71">They already knew what happened to the people. </sentence><sentence id="72">They were thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="73">They already heard of the burnings of the <span class="building">synagogues</span> and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in. </sentence><sentence id="74">It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that <span class="country">Germany</span> was going to be defeated. </sentence><sentence id="75">We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. </sentence><sentence id="76">People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="77">They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign. </sentence><sentence id="78">They occupied <span class="country">Poland</span> or part of <span class="country">Poland</span> and it was benign. </sentence><sentence id="79">In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="80">On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over. </sentence><sentence id="83">Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not going to be that bad. </sentence><sentence id="84">They did not expect anything very bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking? </sentence><sentence id="102">Were they eager for <span class="country">Germany</span> to come in? </sentence><sentence id="103">Were they prepared to fight them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. </sentence><sentence id="108">The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="109">That they are really against Jews, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="110">So, naturally at that point they were united. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Do you remember the day that was occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Do you remember what was going on at this point? </sentence><sentence id="117">You went outside, you realized there had been a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="118">What did you see? </sentence><sentence id="119">What were people doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: Panic, immediately. </sentence><sentence id="125">There was great panic in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">People did not know what to do, to stay in that little <span class="populated place">town</span> or escape to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">My parents they went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">All the six children and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="129">My father was in the <span class="building">militia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">He was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="131">They took him in the <span class="building">militia</span> to watch black outs. </sentence><sentence id="132">Once the <span class="spatial object">German planes</span> came they either threw out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. </sentence><sentence id="133">His aim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who came in there to bomb some <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">So my father was there, and my mother was in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going to happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: So, what happened after this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: I went back with that little <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in the Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there and watched after the <span class="building">mill</span>, which we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: It was still going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="159">I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="160">All of sudden we heard that <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded, and here my mother and father were very anxious because five children were there. </sentence><sentence id="161">We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there were more than a million people in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">My father and mother decided that I should go back to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to help the children. </sentence><sentence id="163">So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it was very tough, tough for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: You were talking about you were going to take some food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: I had to take some food to help because starvation in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> my mother and father heard about. </sentence><sentence id="173">And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> in a small <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it even though <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="175">It was very heavy what they put on, and I remember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="176">But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind of looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there were horses and people on the <span class="dlf">street</span> massacred, killed on the way to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">In other words, out of <span class="populated place">town</span> the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. </sentence><sentence id="178">Many people would walk through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> going to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> you would see carnage. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, my mother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my father clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. </sentence><sentence id="180">I never saw them again. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: How do you know what happened to them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Well, I came back from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, that same day <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> capitulated. </sentence><sentence id="183">I want to tell you first. </sentence><sentence id="184">I made it into <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="185">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="186">It was very hard, but when I came <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting to collect the dead. </sentence><sentence id="187">The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. </sentence><sentence id="188">They were surrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. </sentence><sentence id="189">However, there was a time when they got the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> or whatever, they arranged a one hour to get the dead out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="190">Germans and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="191">At that time, kids like us could go through. </sentence><sentence id="192">I made it and somehow when I came to a certain <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, since they bombarded the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. </sentence><sentence id="193">The flour, we got out of it, but we had other food. </sentence><sentence id="194">The flour went on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and I made it and I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. </sentence><sentence id="195"><span class="spatial object">Artillery</span>, there were people killed, burned, fire was all over. </sentence><sentence id="196">However, the Poles at that time they put up a tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: How old were you at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: You were a little boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the <span class="dlf">street</span> whether the <span class="building">building</span> would collapse. </sentence><sentence id="245">And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after delivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> in case the  Germans advance. </sentence><sentence id="246">They called anybody who could do something. </sentence><sentence id="247">I was frightened, that's the answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: When you were carrying all these goods to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, at this time you were asked to help dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: The Polish people, the Polish Army dig the <span class="dlf">ditches</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: The Army in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was preparing <span class="dlf">ditches</span> against <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, in case they advanced so any able bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they made him come and do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Were you traveling alone or with people? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Tell me a little bit of what happened next, you made it to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="267">We were hiding in <span class="interior space">basements</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">It was really mayhem. </sentence><sentence id="269">People would stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for bread, and artillery would just mow them down and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="270">It was an inferno, fires all over. </sentence><sentence id="271">The funny thing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was, whoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and have the services. </sentence><sentence id="272">Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">Not just artillery, but <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, where they would just circle the <span class="populated place">city</span> and fire whoever they saw or just at random at any <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Did you attend any of these services? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="285">No, I was impatient. </sentence><sentence id="286">I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I had other problems. </sentence><sentence id="287">We had no water and there was a <span class="env feature">river</span> and we were all running for water, to drink water. </sentence><sentence id="288">That's a very terrible deal when you have no <span class="env feature">water</span>, and it was also very dangerous because there were not the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="289">At that time they were </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Jewish people were very scared at that time. </sentence><sentence id="291">I think, or I heard that most of the bombardment at that time was directed to the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>, most of the bombardment and I guess Jews were very much congregated in one <span class="region">area</span> and the Germans were aware -- in fact they were aware of everything, but this in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Were you hiding in this <span class="region">Jewish area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Yes, I was hiding in the <span class="region">Jewish area</span> wherever I could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Do you have any remembrance of any Polish catholic people you knew at this time. </sentence><sentence id="299">Did your relationship with them change or did you separate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the <span class="env feature">river</span> if they get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference whether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. </sentence><sentence id="303">At that point we were all Poles against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="304">I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans because they knew that they anticipated bad days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: How did that relationship start to change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: At the time of bombardment, | think there was no animosity against each other because there was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was no real animosity. </sentence><sentence id="312">People would stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics, Jews or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="313">Each one was miserable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Didn't that relationship, though, change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Not really, only after the war. </sentence><sentence id="321">It always changed later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: That is not something you experienced? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: I did not experience anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: I guess before we continue, when did you get any information about your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Let me tell you. </sentence><sentence id="331">As soon as the armistice was declared, the same day I picked up -- the rest of the children were still in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> -- I picked up and got through the <span class="dlf">line</span>, because even though there was an armistice, you didn't cross the <span class="dlf">line</span>, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="332">However, children they let through, and we went through, and we went up a few kilometers and all of sudden I found out what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="333">I went with another friend. </sentence><sentence id="334">He was not Jewish, he was Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="335">We went back to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and there was a German sentry and he called over because I did not know that they had at that time a curfew in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="336">So, the German soldier just grabbed me and slashed his throat. </sentence><sentence id="337">So, I understood right now that I have a lot of worries watching myself. </sentence><sentence id="338">In the morning I walked. </sentence><sentence id="339">I  couldn't go at night, in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="340">It took me another day to get through to see if I can meet my parents. </sentence><sentence id="341">In the front of the <span class="populated place">city</span> I had an uncle. </sentence><sentence id="342">He had a little <span class="building">restaurant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">I walked into this <span class="building">restaurant</span>, nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="344">I got into that little <span class="populated place">city</span> and all of a sudden I see people that don't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="345">Everytime I ask someone you know where are my parents, they took off. </sentence><sentence id="346">That kind of feeling, maybe they escaped. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, I went into that little <span class="building">mill</span> and people were robbing and I was just sitting until a man came over, a huge man, and he said "These people are robbing this kid. </sentence><sentence id="348">He's just an orphan." </sentence><sentence id="349">I didn't understand him. </sentence><sentence id="350">Then my uncle came in and he says to me "Don't you know about </sentence></p><p><sentence id="351"> ," that's the time I got immediately, and I couldn't believe </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: So, you were there and you didn't know what to do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: We didn't know what to do, and we were very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="354">Somehow, we found also our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="355">We had to go ina little <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">My sister had nothing to survive on -- my sister tried to make some food for people. </sentence><sentence id="357">Sometimes German soldiers used to come by and she would make some food for them in order to earn something. </sentence><sentence id="358">We stayed there, what I remember is all of a sudden my sister disappeared, and we were left. </sentence><sentence id="359">I did not know why, and I was very mad at her. </sentence><sentence id="360">But later I found out that the German soldiers tried to attack her. </sentence><sentence id="361">She was then, I think she was 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="362">She was six years older than me, so she just took off one day, and run abroad to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">See, the Russians took half of <span class="country">Poland</span>, and the Germans took the other one. </sentence><sentence id="364">This was the real pact, the <span class="spatial object">map</span> which separated <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">So, my sister took off, somehow at that time it was chaos. </sentence><sentence id="366">Anybody who could run across even though -- it wasn't easy, but she made it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: The German soldiers tried to rape her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: They tried, yes, but she was ashamed to tell us, and she escaped, and she left us five in that <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="384">She was the cook. </sentence><sentence id="385">Again, we were out of business I think about two months. </sentence><sentence id="386">We had to get out of there, out of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: I know this is a difficult question but did you find out later whether the Germans were able to rape her? </sentence></p></dialogue>

old, and I wasn't too strong either. </sentence><sentence id="745">So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little bit, but I was still hungry. </sentence><sentence id="746">What my downfall is, it started with a dog. </sentence><sentence id="747">These people who ran the place they had their own big <span class="building">house</span> next to it. </sentence><sentence id="748">They were German soldiers and German civilians because most of this was going for the <span class="spatial object">armaments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="749">They were making <span class="spatial

id="760">Don't you get enough food. </sentence><sentence id="761">I was working there for two weeks, I had no food. </sentence><sentence id="762">Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he shamed me in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="763">Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way, but , he had engineering place, all kinds of instruments and a <span class="spatial object">Polish  9</span> out, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food. </sentence><sentence id="764">One time, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just the gist of one event. </sentence><sentence id="765">We're trying to get in and beg for food. </sentence><sentence id="766">We have learned already a little bit how to greet catholic people in their way. </sentence><sentence id="767">So, it was about a four or five story <span class="building">building</span> and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a certain <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and each one of us went to a different <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="768">I knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="769">A woman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I had to. </sentence><sentence id="770">She said to me, "Look, you don't have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="771">I know who you are." </sentence><sentence id="772">I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up. </sentence><sentence id="773">A nice woman and the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water and especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive. </sentence><sentence id="774">We did not look good. </sentence><sentence id="775">That's how they recognized us anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="776">So, she said don't worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="777">Take it off and I'll burn it. </sentence><sentence id="778">I will cook it. </sentence><sentence id="779">Then she was cooking for me something like buckwheat. </sentence><sentence id="780">And they were poor themselves. </sentence><sentence id="781">She didn't have anything to give other than to cook something. </sentence><sentence id="782">And I was hungrier than <span class="region">hell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="783">She sat down with me and I think she was a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me. </sentence><sentence id="784">She said it's such a pity that you Jewish children can not go to <span class="dlf">kingdom of heaven</span> and he had to bring Hitler a man, the <span class="spatial object">destroyer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="785">I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up religious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="786">Well, I understand, but what can we do we're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="787">All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat yet. </sentence><sentence id="788">I hear a shot. </sentence><sentence id="789">The superintendent of the <span class="building">building</span> must have called up the police, the local police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot. </sentence><sentence id="790">He was shot in the leg and he fell. </sentence><sentence id="791">I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span>, but that woman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="792">So, she took me in a <span class="interior space">closet</span>, in <span class="country">Europe</span> they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have outside, and she put me in there and she locked me up. </sentence><sentence id="793">She covered me with all kinds of furs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="794">She was afraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too. </sentence><sentence id="795">So, she went to the neighbors, and I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any air. </sentence><sentence id="796">I was holding my nose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="797">They'll probably ask the other kid on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span> what happened, where I am who is the other one because the superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="798">Well, I was there, running was <span class="env feature">water</span>, I thought this is the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="799">I couldn't breath. </sentence><sentence id="800">I think I passed out for a while. </sentence><sentence id="801">All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was a husband and coming back and screaming. </sentence><sentence id="802">He was a good man, he says look you have to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="803">He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate

guess he was more or less in <span class="interior space">underground</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="828">They had certain connections with people in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> so
