<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Well, we were very hard working, six children, father and mother and we had a small <span class="building">mill</span>, flour, buckwheat. </sentence><sentence id="12">We were not prosperous but comfortable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Did you go to a <span class="building">public school</span>, a <span class="building">private school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: I went to two <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">One was a <span class="building">public school</span> in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="19">In the afternoon I went to a <span class="building">religious school</span> until almost late at night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: So your family was fairly religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: And Judaism was important to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Now, when you went to the <span class="building">public school</span> you had a lot of friends who were not Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: No, the <span class="building">school</span> itself, in this little <span class="populated place">city</span>, was segregated between Catholics and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="34">Mind you, it was a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, and I would say the majority of the people in that small <span class="populated place">town</span> were Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="35">Inside the <span class="populated place">town</span>, somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us Jewish children and Catholic children. </sentence><sentence id="36">As you know, most of the people in <span class="country">Poland</span> were Catholic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Did you have friends who were Catholics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: Yes, I used to have friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Did you feel any anti-semitism growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="48">I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either they were small little -- I would call it -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly got together, and there were incidents. </sentence><sentence id="49">Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were  called in from the <span class="building">house</span>, people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that we were really religious people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Were there any incidents with your brothers or sisters that you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Were there a lot of cultural or social organizations, political organizations in the <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes there were Zionists in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">There were Socialists, there were Communists, even though at that time Communists had to go <span class="interior space">underground</span>, and <span class="building">religious institutions</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Were your parents active in the Zionist movement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: What did you know about Hitler and the rise of Nazism before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. </sentence><sentence id="70">My father used to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="71">However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things. </sentence><sentence id="72">They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="73">In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from <span class="country">Germany</span>, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="74">They really went from <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="populated place">city</span> amongst Jews. </sentence><sentence id="75">There were so many of them that people had to help. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: They told stories of what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Definitely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="88">In a <span class="building">public school</span>, since it was more or less a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="89">He was not Polish, the guy who was running the <span class="building">school</span>, he was not Jewish, he was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="90">In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the <span class="populated place">city</span> very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in <span class="country">Germany</span> might come to your <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">It was known between people that he's not going to stop at that time in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. </sentence><sentence id="100">So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later. </sentence><sentence id="101">A few days before the war they already had black outs in <span class="country">Poland</span>, because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was  about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. </sentence><sentence id="103">We did not know the particulars of what they signed. </sentence><sentence id="104">The Germans, the <span class="country">USSR</span>, we anticipated there would be a war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Was there anything that the <span class="populated place">community</span> did in preparation for this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="116">The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. </sentence><sentence id="117">They already knew what happened to the people. </sentence><sentence id="118">They were thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="119">They already heard of the burnings of the <span class="building">synagogues</span> and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in. </sentence><sentence id="120">It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that <span class="country">Germany</span> was going to be defeated. </sentence><sentence id="121">We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. </sentence><sentence id="122">People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="123">They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign. </sentence><sentence id="124">They occupied <span class="country">Poland</span> or part of <span class="country">Poland</span> and it was benign. </sentence><sentence id="125">In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews. </sentence><sentence id="126">On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over. </sentence><sentence id="129">Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not going to be that bad. </sentence><sentence id="130">They did not expect anything very bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking? </sentence><sentence id="148">Were they eager for <span class="country">Germany</span> to come in? </sentence><sentence id="149">Were they prepared to fight them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. </sentence><sentence id="154">The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="155">That they are really against Jews, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, naturally at that point they were united. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Do you remember the day that was occupied by <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: What I remember is one morning, | think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all of a sudden, a great bang in that little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">A bomb was thrown. </sentence><sentence id="165">We did not know it was a <span class="spatial object">bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">We all ran out and we saw <span class="spatial object">planes</span> going over. </sentence><sentence id="167">There was near the <span class="populated place">town</span>, not far from the <span class="populated place">town</span> were <span class="building">German garrison</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="168">They tried to bomb the <span class="building">garrison</span> but they missed. </sentence><sentence id="169">They bombed the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">At that time, <span class="spatial object">radios</span> whatever you could hear, they announced already that the war had begun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: They tried to bomb a <span class="building">German garrison</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: No, it was a <span class="building">Polish Army garrison</span>, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but they probably missed. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Do you remember what was going on at this point? </sentence><sentence id="183">You went outside, you realized there had been a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="184">What did you see? </sentence><sentence id="185">What were people doing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Panic, immediately. </sentence><sentence id="187">There was great panic in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">People did not know what to do, to stay in that little <span class="populated place">town</span> or escape to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">My parents they went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">All the six children and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="191">My father was in the <span class="building">militia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">He was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="193">They took him in the <span class="building">militia</span> to watch black outs. </sentence><sentence id="194">Once the <span class="spatial object">German planes</span> came they either threw out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. </sentence><sentence id="195">His aim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who came in there to bomb some <span class="dlf">bridges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">So my father was there, and my mother was in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going to happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: So, what happened after this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: I went back with that little <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in the Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there and watched after the <span class="building">mill</span>, which we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: It was still going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="221">I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="222">All of sudden we heard that <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded, and here my mother and father were very anxious because five children were there. </sentence><sentence id="223">We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there were more than a million people in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">My father and mother decided that I should go back to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to help the children. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it was very tough, tough for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: You were talking about you were going to take some food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I had to take some food to help because starvation in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> my mother and father heard about. </sentence><sentence id="235">And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> in a small <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it even though <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="237">It was very heavy what they put on, and I remember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="238">But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind of looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there were horses and people on the <span class="dlf">street</span> massacred, killed on the way to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">In other words, out of <span class="populated place">town</span> the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. </sentence><sentence id="240">Many people would walk through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> going to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> you would see carnage. </sentence><sentence id="241">So, my mother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my father clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. </sentence><sentence id="242">I never saw them again. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: How do you know what happened to them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, I came back from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, that same day <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> capitulated. </sentence><sentence id="245">I want to tell you first. </sentence><sentence id="246">I made it into <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="248">It was very hard, but when I came <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting to collect the dead. </sentence><sentence id="249">The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. </sentence><sentence id="250">They were surrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. </sentence><sentence id="251">However, there was a time when they got the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> or whatever, they arranged a one hour to get the dead out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="252">Germans and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="253">At that time, kids like us could go through. </sentence><sentence id="254">I made it and somehow when I came to a certain <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, since they bombarded the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. </sentence><sentence id="255">The flour, we got out of it, but we had other food. </sentence><sentence id="256">The flour went on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and I made it and I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. </sentence><sentence id="257"><span class="spatial object">Artillery</span>, there were people killed, burned, fire was all over. </sentence><sentence id="258">However, the Poles at that time they put up a tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: How old were you at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: I think I remember I was 12 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: How far was the distance between your <span class="populated place">town</span> and <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Did you walk or on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Only walking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: How long would it normally take to walk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: It didn't take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great. </sentence><sentence id="289">The <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> we had to go at midnight. </sentence><sentence id="290">Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until I made it in. </sentence><sentence id="291">It was like an <span class="env feature">inferno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was an inferno. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Weren't you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: What do you think? </sentence><sentence id="301">I certainly was frightened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: You were a little boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the <span class="dlf">street</span> whether the <span class="building">building</span> would collapse. </sentence><sentence id="307">And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after delivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> in case the  Germans advance. </sentence><sentence id="308">They called anybody who could do something. </sentence><sentence id="309">I was frightened, that's the answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: When you were carrying all these goods to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, at this time you were asked to help dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: The Polish people, the Polish Army dig the <span class="dlf">ditches</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: The Army in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was preparing <span class="dlf">ditches</span> against <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, in case they advanced so any able bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they made him come and do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Were you traveling alone or with people? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">We were hiding in <span class="interior space">basements</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">It was really mayhem. </sentence><sentence id="331">People would stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for bread, and artillery would just mow them down and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="332">It was an inferno, fires all over. </sentence><sentence id="333">The funny thing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was, whoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> and have the services. </sentence><sentence id="334">Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">Not just artillery, but <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, where they would just circle the <span class="populated place">city</span> and fire whoever they saw or just at random at any <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Did you attend any of these services? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="347">No, I was impatient. </sentence><sentence id="348">I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I had other problems. </sentence><sentence id="349">We had no water and there was a <span class="env feature">river</span> and we were all running for water, to drink water. </sentence><sentence id="350">That's a very terrible deal when you have no <span class="env feature">water</span>, and it was also very dangerous because there were not the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="351">At that time they were shooting the people who came for <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">So, some of them never came back. </sentence><sentence id="353">I was very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: Did you see the shooting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: Well, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="365">It wasn't shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the air.l either get trapped or I ran away. </sentence><sentence id="366">IfI get trapped, then I wait there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: What else can you describe about conditions at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Jewish people were very scared at that time. </sentence><sentence id="373">I think, or I heard that most of the bombardment at that time was directed to the <span class="populated place">Jewish quarter</span>, most of the bombardment and I guess Jews were very much congregated in one <span class="region">area</span> and the Germans were aware -- in fact they were aware of everything, but this in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Were you hiding in this <span class="region">Jewish area</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Yes, I was hiding in the <span class="region">Jewish area</span> wherever I could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Do you have any remembrance of any Polish catholic people you knew at this time. </sentence><sentence id="379">Did your relationship with them change or did you separate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the <span class="env feature">river</span> if they get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference whether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. </sentence><sentence id="383">At that point we were all Poles against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="384">I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans because they knew that they anticipated bad days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: How did that relationship start to change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: At the time of bombardment, | think there was no animosity against each other because there was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of. </sentence><sentence id="391">There was no real animosity. </sentence><sentence id="392">People would stand in <span class="dlf">line</span> for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics, Jews or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="393">Each one was miserable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: Didn't that relationship, though, change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Not really, only after the war. </sentence><sentence id="401">It always changed later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: That is not something you experienced? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: Yes, and this was my downfall. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what happened is I wasn't strong enough to pull the <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> so they sent me they had other jobs, to send me to people in <span class="building">factories</span> where they were making clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1060">But my last job, that was my downfall. </sentence><sentence id="1061">That was my downfall. </sentence><sentence id="1062">They sent me to a <span class="building">factory</span> outside the Ghetto.[had to go at 5:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1063">You had to go with the <span class="building">German sentries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1064">If they wanted to warm themselves up, they would chase me around just for exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1065">They would chase me around and around and made me run. </sentence><sentence id="1066">It was bad. </sentence><sentence id="1067">So, I went through it was a problem in <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> a big <span class="building">foundry</span>, a big <span class="building">factory</span> run by Germans and some Jews who before the war were foremen. </sentence><sentence id="1068">I used to get up in the morning hoping that I would get to eat something. </sentence><sentence id="1069">But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I had to pick up 30 or 40 pounds of burned up steel and throw them into the fire walking on the . </sentence><sentence id="1071">Iwas very week. </sentence><sentence id="1072">I couldn't do the job. </sentence><sentence id="1073">I was always thinking to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1074">It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1075">So eventually some Polish people who worked with me, they give me a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1076">I was still hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The <span class="building">orphanage</span> -- the people were still sleeping while I was going to work. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I wasn't the only one, in other places they woke up early. </sentence><sentence id="1079">So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I was very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I had to walk up with a load of 40 or 50 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1081">Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have food and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1082">They were working people, hard working people, and I explained I came from the <span class="building">orphanage</span> because I had to keep up with them and I couldn't keep up. </sentence><sentence id="1083">I think I was about 14 years  8 old, and I wasn't too strong either. </sentence><sentence id="1084">So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little bit, but I was still hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1085">What my downfall is, it started with a dog. </sentence><sentence id="1086">These people who ran the place they had their own big <span class="building">house</span> next to it. </sentence><sentence id="1087">They were German soldiers and German civilians because most of this was going for the <span class="spatial object">armaments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1088">They were making <span class="spatial object">presses</span> there and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Somehow they were always happened, but I noticed that the dog gets a lot of food after lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1090">The dog got a lot of food but I couldn't reach it. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Everytime I went by I wanted to grab something. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Finally I got acquainted over a week or two he would finish eating I would grab some. </sentence><sentence id="1093">He was happy, and it was good stuff for the dog. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I ate it and I felt good. </sentence><sentence id="1095">So one day, I could always get after he was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1096">If not, he would growl. </sentence><sentence id="1097">That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was Jewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me. </sentence><sentence id="1098">You go taking away the food of the dog. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Don't you get enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I was working there for two weeks, I had no food. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he shamed me in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="1102">Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way, but , he had engineering place, all kinds of instruments and a Polish engineer was there and he started hitting me again. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Aren't you ashamed he said. </sentence><sentence id="1104">You're a Jewish boy, to do those things. </sentence><sentence id="1105">When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured that's the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I grabbed a inch by inch a <span class="spatial object">steel ruler</span> and I grabbed it instantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1108">I could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow, but I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, and I was afraid to go back in. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Then my little brother came out at night. </sentence><sentence id="1110">I was I think sleeping over at my brother's. </sentence><sentence id="1111">He said, don't go there. </sentence><sentence id="1112">The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you might compromise the whole place. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I don't know to this day what happened to that man, but I know the glasses and blood was running out. </sentence><sentence id="1114">From then on I became what we call in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, a wild boy. </sentence><sentence id="1115">My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead people on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but everyday hundreds of people would lay down and die. </sentence><sentence id="1118">They couldn't either take it anymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning, I wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of those half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> everybody you couldn't go away without a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Sometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself. </sentence><sentence id="1122">That's how I got breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Some of the time I was beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="1124">They used to smuggle in potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1125">If something fell I would grab and they would run after me and beat the hell out of me. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Hygiene, very dirty. </sentence><sentence id="1127">There was no place to take a <span class="spatial object">shower</span> any more. </sentence><sentence id="1128">You go around desperate. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1130">I didn't run away but to go out for some food. </sentence><sentence id="1131">One incident I want to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1132">So, the situation was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Children, especially elderly people would be laying down there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because they had no place to stay or they gave up. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I decided with other kids we're going to take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1135">They used to take out groups to work outside the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went  9 out, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food. </sentence><sentence id="1136">One time, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just the gist of one event. </sentence><sentence id="1137">We're trying to get in and beg for food. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We have learned already a little bit how to greet catholic people in their way. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So, it was about a four or five story <span class="building">building</span> and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a certain <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and each one of us went to a different <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1140">I knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">A woman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I had to. </sentence><sentence id="1142">She said to me, "Look, you don't have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I know who you are." </sentence><sentence id="1144">I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up. </sentence><sentence id="1145">A nice woman and the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water and especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We did not look good. </sentence><sentence id="1147">That's how they recognized us anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So, she said don't worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Take it off and I'll burn it. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I will cook it. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Then she was cooking for me something like buckwheat. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And they were poor themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1153">She didn't have anything to give other than to cook something. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And I was hungrier than <span class="region">hell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1155">She sat down with me and I think she was a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me. </sentence><sentence id="1156">She said it's such a pity that you Jewish children can not go to <span class="dlf">kingdom of heaven</span> and he had to bring Hitler a man, the <span class="spatial object">destroyer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up religious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Well, I understand, but what can we do we're hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1159">All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat yet. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I hear a shot. </sentence><sentence id="1161">The superintendent of the <span class="building">building</span> must have called up the police, the local police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1162">He was shot in the leg and he fell. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span>, but that woman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So, she took me in a <span class="interior space">closet</span>, in <span class="country">Europe</span> they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have outside, and she put me in there and she locked me up. </sentence><sentence id="1165">She covered me with all kinds of furs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="1166">She was afraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So, she went to the neighbors, and I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any air. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I was holding my nose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They'll probably ask the other kid on the second <span class="interior space">floor</span> what happened, where I am who is the other one because the superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Well, I was there, running was <span class="env feature">water</span>, I thought this is the end of me. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I couldn't breath. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I think I passed out for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1173">All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was a husband and coming back and screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1174">He was a good man, he says look you have to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1175">He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him. </sentence><sentence id="1176">When they took me out, I didn't go out, I fell out. </sentence><sentence id="1177">But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Gave me new clothes because my clothes were wet. </sentence><sentence id="1179">He was still cooking and food and everything and at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was very connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food. </sentence><sentence id="1180">He gave me food and everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I had food for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1182">What I'm trying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to hell, almost dead. </sentence><sentence id="1183">The guy on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1184">I don't know what happened to the first <span class="interior space">floor</span> whether they took him back to the <span class="building">hospital</span> or not. </sentence><sentence id="1185">I never met him. </sentence><sentence id="1186">This kid, the  0 other one, told on me and again I had to change clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I had to make myself all kind of dirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="1188">But I was sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who Iam. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I am going to die there. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I went over to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were close. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other <span class="region">side</span>, some of them recognized, some of them didn't recognize. </sentence><sentence id="1194">I am going to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Whatever happens, happens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1196">So, he says look, tell me something, you go because there's no hope here. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I'll take you through. </sentence><sentence id="1198">The way they took through people was they went to work outside and they could squeeze me, but he was already an educated guy. </sentence><sentence id="1199">He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a Zionist group and I guess he was more or less in <span class="interior space">underground</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="1200">They had certain connections with people in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over there. </sentence><sentence id="1201">He drew up a <span class="spatial object">map</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1202">You take this <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1203">There was a <span

class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1205">When you hit under the try to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1206">So, he gave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I had, not much, and to go and get a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I walked out of the group which went to work and ran away. </sentence><sentence id="1208">I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money he had. </sentence><sentence id="1209">He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1210">I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated, I was moving back, because there was a <span class="dlf">line</span> of people, to go or not to go, because I think only older people go and I was just a little kid in between. </sentence><sentence id="1211">So, I moved out, all of sudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me, don't go in there in German they said they'll you. </sentence><sentence id="1212">They will finish you off in German. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I pretended I didn't know a word of German. </sentence><sentence id="1214">So I was saying again in <span class="country">Czech</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1215">He got mad and he started talking in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1216">He knew both languages. </sentence><sentence id="1217">He said you get the hell away from here. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They will kill you. </sentence><sentence id="1219">I have an idea after today, he was an angel and he saved me. </sentence><sentence id="1220">But where do I go. </sentence><sentence id="1221">I had a map, about a journey of two days hit the in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and i don't know where to go so I went to the <span class="building">Central Station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1222">I went to <span class="building">Central Station</span> but my heart was pumping. </sentence><sentence id="1223">I didn't know whether they would recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid attention to me. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I had a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1225">This was early in the morning when I got out, and where do you go. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that <span class="building">Central Station</span> entrance because there were so many German SS around there checking for 5 which means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are. </sentence><sentence id="1227">They called them ,and I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1228">Where do you go, so I was just roaming around the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him to a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60 kilometers outside of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1229">But they had a little <span class="spatial object">train</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="1230">It wasn't large <span class="dlf">rails</span> and small and it sort of dragged into that little <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1231">So I said maybe down there there won't be so many soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it get a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1233">So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money  1 and give the conductor. </sentence><sentence id="1235">They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers. </sentence><sentence id="1236">So, I sat down amongst the women. </sentence><sentence id="1237">They were smugglers. </sentence><sentence id="1238">They would smuggle in food to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and buy clothes there. </sentence><sentence id="1239">This was their job. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So amongst them I sat between them they asked me where do you come from? </sentence><sentence id="1241">What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1242">I told them, listen my father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Iam looking for my mother because my father lived in the <span class="region">German occupied area</span> and my mother took off and she's supposed to be around this <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1244">So, they started giving me salami, food, anything what I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1245">When the conductor came he, they said you don't touch that kid. </sentence><sentence id="1246">In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I don't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what am I doing. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I didn't have a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I was still scared. </sentence><sentence id="1250">When the <span class="dlf">rail</span> -- the <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> slowed down and the front of that <span class="populated place">city</span> it was called and in the front of that <span class="populated place">city</span> there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were smuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Where do you go now? </sentence><sentence id="1252">I was just running in the direction of the end of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Dark, I went through a little <span class="env feature">river</span> up to here, and down across was a <span class="env feature">forest</span> and I didn't know, you

</sentence><sentence id="2401">Either they were barbarians or they were just got out of the <span class="interior space">caves</span> and to go ahead and hate, make us miserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery. </sentence><sentence id="2402">They brought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I would say prepare the <span class="interior space">stage</span> where they could kill us because we are not worthy living and they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened everybody in the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2403">No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be  4 clean nothing but sickness, people dying on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in <span class="country">Poland</span> and they couldn't understand, they would not believe that they could do it to us. </sentence><sentence id="2404">They didn't believe that the German would eventually kill all of them. </sentence><sentence id="2405">They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the people of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education, making them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured that these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm sure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
