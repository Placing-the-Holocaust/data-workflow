<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3234">A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life. </sentence><sentence id="3235">So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to. </sentence><sentence id="3236">I mean, s-sitting at a <span class="spatial object">table</span> with the family rather than in a <span class="building">compound</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3237">Cooking, baking, washing. </sentence><sentence id="3238">You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in <span class="country">Indonesia</span> before, and | think they lived at <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3239">And they lived behind a <span class="dlf">partition wall</span> for several years. </sentence><sentence

-- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving. </sentence><sentence id="3245">But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com -- can't do anything on a Sunday.

was very common. </sentence><sentence id="3253">Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little <span class="interior space">attic</span>, in a little <span class="populated place">town</span> up in -- in the <span class="country">country</span>, again didn't see daylight, public daylight for several years. </sentence><sentence id="3254">And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, emblems. </sentence><sentence id="3255">I believe that's how he spent his time. </sentence><sentence id="3256">And so the reconstituting of life in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting. </sentence><sentence id="3257">These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a <span class="building">restaurant</span>, <span class="building">kosher restaurant</span> in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was gone, all their belongings were gone. </sentence><sentence id="3258">They couldn't -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn't get it back, even because they survived. </sentence><sentence id="3259">People denied, apparently that they had received anything. </sentence><sentence id="3260">They had to start from scratch, in very small <span class="interior space">quarters</span>, we lived in very, very small <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3261">There was no <span class="spatial object">shower</span> or <span class="interior space">bathtub</span> in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3262">We had a little <span class="spatial object">metal bathtub</span> that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to <span class="interior space">public baths</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3263">This was the life. </sentence><sentence id="3264">But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3265">Of course they would -- had the <span class="building">restaurant</span> before, they're still -- so they're getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. </sentence><sentence id="3266">Some widowers, or single people, lost their family. </sentence><sentence id="3267">So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Whether they paid or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3269">But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3270">You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience. </sentence><sentence id="3271">The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person. </sentence><sentence id="3272">And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled. </sentence><sentence id="3273">And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair. </sentence><sentence id="3274">And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the <span class="interior space">room</span>, the small <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3275">And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="3276">So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again. </sentence><sentence id="3277">These people, the Bergers, at this <span class="building">restaurant</span>, also kept kosher, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="3278">And basically ate dairy, because they didn't have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. </sentence><sentence id="3279">But because of their hospitality reputation, and <span class="building">restaurant</span> reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through <span class="country">Holland</span> from <span class="country">Canada</span>, or from <span class="country">England</span>, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their <span class="building">house</span>, or ate in their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3280">But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat. </sentence><sentence id="3281">But didn't have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. </sentence><sentence id="3282">So the <span class="spatial object">cans</span> were warmed up on the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3283">That's the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant <span class="building">restaurant</span> with all the trappings of a <span class="building">restaurant</span>, having to serve their own in this way. </sentence><sentence id="3284">But they made -- they made the transition, we'll open up another <span
