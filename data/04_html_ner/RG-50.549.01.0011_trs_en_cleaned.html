<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">And, of course, the clothing was the clothing that they had managed to bring from the other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2">From <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> mostly, because a lot of inmates in <span class="populated place">Bergen- Belsen</span> had come from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3">And this was mostly clothing that belonged to Jewish people or other people that were taken to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">And we had to sort things, socks and stockings and underwear. </sentence><sentence id="5">All of it, by the time we got it, | think it was already washed. </sentence><sentence id="6">And there was an SS man in charge. </sentence><sentence id="7">Every morning we had to get up, | do remember we had to get at about 5 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="8">Appell was at 5:30. </sentence><sentence id="9">| was given -- when | came to this <span class="building">barrack</span>, | was given a uniform, a famous gray and blue striped. </sentence><sentence id="10">Basically, what women were given. </sentence><sentence id="11">It's like a dress, not a jacket. </sentence><sentence id="12">Men wore pants -- slacks and jackets, and we wore like long dress. </sentence><sentence id="13">And underneath, since | was working in the <span class="building">warehouse</span>, | was permitted the first day when | came, because | probably had rags by the time | got to this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">But | was permitted to take from the <span class="building">warehouse</span> a pair panties, | suppose maybe some stockings, maybe slacks. </sentence><sentence id="15">| don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="16">And it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="17">A blouse and a sweater. </sentence><sentence id="18">| didn't have a bra, | didn't any bra. </sentence><sentence id="19">| was just as flat as anything. </sentence><sentence id="20">| was very skinny already. </sentence><sentence id="21">The way one could survive in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> when one worked, and that's why the death rate on this <span class="populated place">working camps</span> was a little lower, was that you could steal something and exchange it. </sentence><sentence id="22">So when | finally got to this working place where that first day that | got my clothing, when | came <span class="building">home</span> -- <span class="building">home</span> meaning to the <span class="building">barrack</span> -- | would, say, take off my sweater. </sentence><sentence id="23">And the next day, | would just put on my blouse and that uniform, and that sweater stayed on my <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="24">Or | sold it that evening for a couple pieces of bread maybe or a bowl of soup. </sentence><sentence id="25">Then the next day, | would go to <span class="building">work</span>, and when | was working, there was always a chance you could sneak in somewhere and get a pair of -- get another sweater and put it on and then | had something. </sentence><sentence id="26">Unfortunately, we had a <span class="spatial object">kapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">A kapo is a Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="28">Actually, she was probably just a couple of years older than |. </sentence><sentence id="29">She was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="30">She was not a like | was. </sentence><sentence id="31">| was very skinny, | looked like -- | was already at that point a walking skeleton, and | think she disliked me. </sentence><sentence id="32">She disliked all of us who looked so terribly bad, and | thought one day of trying to read. </sentence><sentence id="33">I'm sure something was written about Jewish women -- of course, she was a bitch. </sentence><sentence id="34">But why she was so particularly mean to me and those of us who looked so bad would probably make a good case study for a psychologist. </sentence><sentence id="35">Was it that she saw in me what could happen to her? </sentence><sentence id="36">Probably. </sentence><sentence id="37">There was another reason why she disliked me, and that was my own fault. </sentence><sentence id="38">The SS man who was in charge of our group sent her to get some books from a little -- there was a little <span class="building">office</span> where he had some books. </sentence><sentence id="39">He needed something. </sentence><sentence id="40">Well, she was | think illiterate, or if she was not illiterate -- maybe she was not illiterate. </sentence><sentence id="41">But she certainly did not read and write German. </sentence><sentence id="42">| don't know how good her Polish was. </sentence><sentence id="43">| didn't speak to her much. </sentence><sentence id="44">She was born in <span class="country">Poland</span>, she came from a little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">She was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="46">So he sent her to get the book, and she brought the wrong book because she didn't know how to read. </sentence><sentence id="47">But she didn't have the courage to tell him, "I don't read German." </sentence><sentence id="48">So he turned around and looked at me, and he said, "This This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="49">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="50"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection little one looks smart. </sentence><sentence id="51">Why don't you go and get me the book?" </sentence><sentence id="52">And | made a horrible mistake, and brought him the right book. </sentence><sentence id="53">And she never forgave me for that, so as a result, what she did is the following day when we came on appell, she made me lift up my uniform to check what | missing. </sentence><sentence id="54">And when she saw that | didn't have a blouse on, that | only had the sweater which is what maybe | was hoping to steal so | could have a bowl of soup. </sentence><sentence id="55">Right away, whatever | sold and whatever | got for it | shared with my girlfriend, Frieda, always. </sentence><sentence id="56">So she said -- she started beating on me, of course, and she said, "You're not going to take anything back with you." </sentence><sentence id="57">Even though this was a kind of a gentleman's agreement, everybody did it. </sentence><sentence id="58">She did it, too. </sentence><sentence id="59">And so my career in that sense ended. </sentence><sentence id="60">| had an interesting thing that happened because of it. </sentence><sentence id="61">I'm taking you to a different part. </sentence><sentence id="62">The girl with whom | shared that <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> was a cousin of Frieda's friend in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">When Frieda was taken out from that <span class="building">barrack</span>, from that <span class="building">death barrack</span>, very -- originally, if you heard my story, you know that someone whose life was saved my Frieda's sister took her out of that place. </sentence><sentence id="64">And she first didn't want to go, but she went because, of course -- that same, her name was Salka Longett (ph), the same woman who took Frieda out of the <span class="building">death barrack</span> took out another girl by the name of -- her name was Ruth, and | don't remember her other name now. </sentence><sentence id="65">And Ruth was her girlfriend, so she also saved Ruth. </sentence><sentence id="66">| mean -- | don't mean save, but took her out that horrible <span class="building">barrack</span> where the death rate was the highest. </sentence><sentence id="67">So when Frieda was able to get me to this working <span class="building">barrack</span>, that friend of hers, Ruth, with whom she became friendly now because they were working together in that <span class="building">hospital</span>, managed to get her cousin. </sentence><sentence id="68">And that cousin's name was -- | don't remember anymore, Franka (ph), Francis. </sentence><sentence id="69">She was a very placid, not very bright girl, and | think she was just not a very nice person. </sentence><sentence id="70">But maybe, maybe just not to me, | don't know. </sentence><sentence id="71">She fared much better with the <span class="spatial object">kapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">First of all, she was not that skinny. </sentence><sentence id="73">As | said, | think she was not that bright. </sentence><sentence id="74">And she was managing to -- and she didn't get sick as | did shortly after that. </sentence><sentence id="75">But whatever it was, but she knew that all of us were bringing things. </sentence><sentence id="76">She didn't know that | was being picked on by the <span class="building">kapo</span>, or she didn't pay attention. </sentence><sentence id="77">What she did do is that after the war, after | was already out of the <span class="building">hospital</span> and now I'm going ahead of it. </sentence><sentence id="78">| didn't see my friend, Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="79">| fully expected her to come and see me, and she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="80">She came to the <span class="building">hospital</span> once, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="81">| don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="82">But just the relationship was not what it was, and so | went -- when | was already better, | went to see my girlfriend, Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she was cold to me, she wasn't very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="84">| don't know that | ever told anybody that, but | just remembered. </sentence><sentence id="85">So | said, "Frieda" -- we went out for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was already in the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">And | said to her, "Frieda, what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="88">Why are you so uncaring? </sentence><sentence id="89">Is something wrong?" </sentence><sentence id="90">And she got very angry. </sentence><sentence id="91">She got very upset, and she said that Francis, the other girl, told her that | did not share with her everything that | was able to get -- you know, that | was getting, bringing some stuff and | was probably selling it and getting maybe some bread. </sentence><sentence id="92">And | want you to know that Frieda was not living in heaven there. </sentence><sentence id="93">| mean she was working in that <span class="building">hospital</span>, but she was hungry from -- | mean there was just no question that <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="94">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="95"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection a horrible place, even if you work. </sentence><sentence id="96">And she said that she was very hurt when she heard Francis tell her that | did not share, because this was -- you know, we were like sisters. </sentence><sentence id="97">This was an agreement that -- we didn't write anything to each other, but this was a given. </sentence><sentence id="98">And she said to me that that's what Francis told her, that | did not -- that | basically cheated on Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="99">And | got terribly upset, | remember | cried. </sentence><sentence id="100">We had a long talk, and we made up. </sentence><sentence id="101">She believed me. </sentence><sentence id="102">I'm grateful to this day we are still friends. </sentence><sentence id="103">In fact, | just saw her in <span class="country">Israel</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="104">But so | had this terrible experience, but it was this Francis with whom | shared, that bum. </sentence><sentence id="105">And it was this Francis who | remember, because she did not get sick as | did, when | was so sick toward the end of my stay in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> that she just was just a very uncaring person, at least as far as | was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="106">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: The close relationship that you had with Frieda was clearly very important to you. </sentence><sentence id="214">Was that -- did other women have close relationships like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: That was very important to many of us. </sentence><sentence id="218">Very often a relationship such as this was was there between, let's say, two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="219">If some of them were lucky and they had a mother and daughter, but usually two sisters, two cousins. </sentence><sentence id="220">Interestingly enough, not always did the two sisters get along. </sentence><sentence id="221">It was not always, but many of us did form these kind of relationships, and it was extremely important for all kinds of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="222">| mean not just -- first of all, it was important to survival. </sentence><sentence id="223">When we were on the death march, when Frieda couldn't walk, | dragged her. </sentence><sentence id="224">And when she didn't want to get up, | pushed her. </sentence><sentence id="225">Or | couldn't -- and in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, if it wouldn't be for Frieda, | probably wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you. </sentence><sentence id="226">There's no question that she saved my life, and | don't think this was true just for me. </sentence><sentence id="227">We had a lot of us formed these kind of relationships. </sentence><sentence id="228">| know that Henry, my husband, had a kind of -- actually, he was with a group, but he had one friend who | didn't even know about, because Henry doesn't talk much. </sentence><sentence id="229">But we were in <span class="country">Sweden</span> a couple of years ago, and we were staying with one of his friends with whom he was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">And his name is Jacob, and they were awfully nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="231">We had a tour, but then we stayed a couple of days with them. </sentence><sentence id="232">And Jacob told me for the first time, | didn't know, that he's alive because of Henry. </sentence><sentence id="233">That Henry literally carried him during the death march. </sentence><sentence id="234">Henry never told me that, but these things were happening to a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="235">This was very important to have somebody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Once the British came and you started to get your health back, you stayed there because it became a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>; is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: How did -- what was your life like there, let's just say, for like the first three months or so of that summer of 1945? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: I'm trying to remember. </sentence><sentence id="262">| probably came out of the <span class="building">hospital</span> -- | was liberated on April 15th. </sentence><sentence id="263">| have no dates to give you, | don't remember when | was -- they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="264">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="265"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection probably took me out of the <span class="building">hospital</span> as soon as | was not contagious. </sentence><sentence id="266">Because when | was taken to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, | had paratyphus, but | was already lucid. </sentence><sentence id="267">|, for instance, remember being taken out, not fully, but | remember that they put us on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> or something, since the sick people went first. </sentence><sentence id="268">But | do remember being sprayed with DDT, | always talk about it; it's such a wonderful feeling. </sentence><sentence id="269">And | remember that the <span class="env feature">air</span>, when we're driven out of <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, the <span class="env feature">air</span> smelled so sweet once we left. </sentence><sentence id="270">But | don't remember how long | was in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">It was not probably a very long time because | think that it was already in May | was already in a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">In the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>, actually, you probably know about it, was formed in a place called <span class="populated place">Bergen</span>, not <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273"><span class="populated place">Bergen</span> had -- these were army, this was an <span class="populated place">army camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And what the British did, is that they took over the <span class="populated place">German Army camp</span>, and they turned it into a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">The Jews were not the only inmates there. </sentence><sentence id="276">They had Russians -- | don't think there were too many Poles there, meaning non-Jewish Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="277">There was Polish, but no Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="278">They had men and women, but they kept the <span class="building">barracks</span> separately. </sentence><sentence id="279">So | was put in, | remember | was in Block -- if I'm not mistaken -- <span class="dlf">Block Number 73</span>, which was one of the <span class="dlf">blocks</span> where the women were put. </sentence><sentence id="280">And what they would do, we were given a <span class="interior space">room</span>, the <span class="dlf">blocks</span> was a <span class="building">two-story house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">| don't remember how many <span class="interior space">rooms</span> were on each <span class="interior space">floor</span>, but | do remember that we had a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and <span class="interior space">showers</span> on one <span class="interior space">floor</span> and then one -- so | have no idea how many. </sentence><sentence id="282">| don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="283">| do know that | was given a <span class="interior space">room</span> on the <span class="interior space">second story</span>, <span class="interior space">second floor</span> with this Francis. </sentence><sentence id="284">Probably because | came out with her, and | very quickly moved out. </sentence><sentence id="285">| didn't want to share with her. </sentence><sentence id="286">There may have been somebody else in that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">And | meta very nice girl who was from <span class="populated place">Ledz</span>, was in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, who was about five years older than |. </sentence><sentence id="288">And | actually came to borrow a <span class="spatial object">frying pan</span> from her, | wanted to do something. </sentence><sentence id="289">And we became very friendly, and she took me into the <span class="interior space">room</span> where she shared with three other women. </sentence><sentence id="290">And so we were five of us in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, and we also had <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, but these <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> were now private. </sentence><sentence id="291">| had my own <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, and there was one above me and there were five or six <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">Because | think eventually, we took in another girl, and the <span class="interior space">room</span> had -- so we had <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">It was a good-sized <span class="interior space">room</span>, and there was a <span class="spatial object">table</span> in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="294">And then there was a <span class="interior space">closet</span>, | suppose, for clothing. </sentence><sentence id="295">People had clothing. </sentence><sentence id="296">And then, of course, if we wanted to wash and <span class="spatial object">shower</span> or use the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, there was one big communal. </sentence><sentence id="297">| suppose this was the way soldiers lived in these <span class="building">barracks</span>, so that's -- it was summer. </sentence><sentence id="298">We were coming out from a bad situation, we had food. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was not wonderful food, but we were -- I'm trying to remember. </sentence><sentence id="300">We probably were given all the bread we -- we had enough. </sentence><sentence id="301">| remember for the first time not being hungry, which means that we were given soups. </sentence><sentence id="302">| think <span class="building">ONR</span> moved in rather quickly and provided, they had big <span class="interior space">kitchens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had to go to the <span class="interior space">kitchens</span> to pick up our -- | think, midday soup meal. </sentence><sentence id="304">In other words, we were given soup and probably bread. </sentence><sentence id="305">| don't remember anything more than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: What did you do during the first few weeks? </sentence><sentence id="353">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="354">Were you strong enough to go out? </sentence><sentence id="355">Could you leave the <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="486">Q: What would you sing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: All kinds of songs. </sentence><sentence id="489">Polish songs, anything that | remembered. </sentence><sentence id="490">| came from a bit of singing family. </sentence><sentence id="491">My mom had a beautiful voice, and we always sang at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">So | sang whatever, you know. </sentence><sentence id="493">And | would try to make her eat, and friends came. </sentence><sentence id="494">In fact, Henry, my husband, who was not my friend then, but he knew Esther because he comes from the same <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="495">And they were together in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in the same <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="496">Anyway, | remember he would come and bring some goodies. </sentence><sentence id="497">Men always managed to bring some food. </sentence><sentence id="498">They managed to -- he probably already was getting out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="499">But | don't remember how long it lasted, but | think that what | did then and | talked to her. </sentence><sentence id="500">And | would have a talk to help, and then -- originally, first, of course, she was talking about her boyfriend and Manik and what friends they had and how much she loved him and all that. </sentence><sentence id="501">But then | would -- today, | suppose | could say that maybe | acted as a therapist. </sentence><sentence id="502">But | didn't have any schooling, | just did something instinctively trying to help her. </sentence><sentence id="503">So | started to ask her to tell me about life before the war, what she did before the war. </sentence><sentence id="504">What <span class="building">school</span> she went to, who were her friends. </sentence><sentence id="505">And then she told me that she had a boyfriend before the war, that she had a boyfriend, and they were kind of like childhood sweethearts. </sentence><sentence id="506">And in 1939 when the war broke out, her boyfriend, whose name was Lolak (ph), and his father -- his father was a professor at the <span class="building">Jewish Gymnasium</span>, and they knew because they were intelligentsia that they're going to be -- they were in anger. </sentence><sentence id="507">They were told that the best thing for them is to get out. </sentence><sentence id="508">At that time it wasn't because he was Jewish, this was when the Germans were removing the Polish intelligentsia, and among them, of course, the educated Jews, too. </sentence><sentence id="509">So Lolak's father, his name was Seka and Lolak decided to run away to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">And they came to Esther, and they wanted her to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="511">Lolak, her boyfriend, was a year older than Esther, and he graduated from the <span class="building">Jewish Gymnasium</span> in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="512">He was accepted at the <span

collection Esther, who was also accepted. </sentence><sentence id="515">And they were going to go in 1939 to <span class="country">Israel</span>, but they missed it because war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="516">So they were really serious about each other, and he wanted her to go with him to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="517">But she was an only child and she couldn't leave her parents, so they parted company and he escaped to <span class="country">Russia</span> with his father. </sentence><sentence id="518">When she started to talk to me about <span class="populated place">Lolak</span>, | kept going back to <span class="populated place">Lolak</span>. </sentence><sentence id="519">Whenever she would mention her boyfriend, then apparently life took its course. </sentence><sentence id="520">Lolak was in <span class="country">Russia</span>, she was a very pretty girl. </sentence><sentence id="521">She met this guy in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and they became close and had he survived, I'm sure she would have ended up with him. </sentence><sentence id="522">But | just wanted to know about all of that, and | made her talk to me about all that. </sentence><sentence id="523">And | was singing to her, and she was so -- | think that | probably spent probably the rest of that month, May, maybe into, | would say -- | would say that it took about maybe a month to get her back out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="524">And she did get out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, and she went back to work in the <span class="building">hospital</span> where she had started before she decided that life is not worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="525">And | want to tell you that -- two things: Number one when she came back, when she came back to herself, somebody came and told me that my father is alive and was in <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: That's your. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: My father. </sentence><sentence id="571">That somebody by the name of Aaron Nakabovich (ph), that's my father's name, is alive, and he should be somewhere in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> near <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">Now, | had not seen him on the list, but somebody said that they saw him on the list. </sentence><sentence id="573">| did find my sister at that point -- no, | didn't. </sentence><sentence id="574">| knew my sister had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="575">No, | didn't know anything about my sister, but | put my name on the list. </sentence><sentence id="576">And when | heard that my father is alive, | decided to go and look for her. </sentence><sentence id="577">Now, this is an interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="578">Because what happened is that traveling through <span class="country">Germany</span> at that point was impossible, but people did. </sentence><sentence id="579">We were looking for people, so the first thing that was necessary was to outfit me for the trip. </sentence><sentence id="580">And my girlfriend, Esther, who was not a wondertul thief, stole -- | didn't have shoes. </sentence><sentence id="581">| had like <span class="spatial object">cloppers</span>, it was summer. </sentence><sentence id="582">And | probably had some clothing that the <span class="building">ONR</span> gave me, but where I'm going to go on a trip, | need something a little more decent than that. </sentence><sentence id="583">A warm jacket maybe. </sentence><sentence id="584">Evenings in <span class="country">Europe</span>, even in the summer, are cold, colder. </sentence><sentence id="585">So she stole shoes, two shoes for me. </sentence><sentence id="586">But they were two left shoes, they were, you know, kind of like, you know, like shoes with lace. </sentence><sentence id="587">Good walking shoes. </sentence><sentence id="588">So she stole them, or organized them as we used to call it in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">Somebody gave me, or maybe | had a pair of slacks. </sentence><sentence id="590">And then another girl -- the whole <span class="interior space">room</span> got together and they outfitted me. </sentence><sentence id="591">So | got a pair of slacks and | got a nice shirt anda shirt to change, and a sweater or a jacket, and even a kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="592">And Esther was telling me how to, if | need to get off the <span class="spatial object">train</span> or | need to step down or something, since I'm wearing slacks, you can't tell that they are two left shoes. </sentence><sentence id="593">But if | always step out with my left foot, then nobody will notice that | have two left shoes. </sentence><sentence id="594">Managed very well with these two left shoes, so | went, but I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="595">It had to be arranged. </sentence><sentence id="596">| didn't go alone. </sentence><sentence id="597">| went with, actually, Henry and a friend of his, because they had had pneumonia and they were being sent to a <span class="building">sanitorium</span> just to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="598">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="599"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection make sure that it doesn't develop into something else. </sentence><sentence id="600">So they were going to a place called <span class="building">sanitorium</span> near <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, and | wanted to go to <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, so | went with them. </sentence><sentence id="601">And it was an experience, because you couldn't buy tickets. </sentence><sentence id="602">You had to -- some of Henry's friends literally carried us and threw us into a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that was leaving <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">| don't know how we got to <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="604">| know how we did. </sentence><sentence id="605">Henry had a friend who was already working for the British, he spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="606">So he managed to borrow a <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span>. </sentence><sentence id="607">So the three of us, with his friend -- his name was Alexander, took us to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to the nearest <span class="populated place">city</span> which was called <span class="populated place">Hannover</span>. </sentence><sentence id="608">We went from -- and a couple of his friends must have gone along, because | remember being thrown into the <span class="spatial object">train</span> through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, okay. </sentence><sentence id="609">And somehow the three of us got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went to the -- stopped at the <span class="region">American zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="610">Because, you see, we're in the <span class="region">British zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="611">So we had to get through to the <span class="region">American zone</span>, but this was the beginning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="612">The soldiers were very sympathetic to us, they knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="613">All we had to do is tell them that we are Jewish, DP, you know, people -- refugees. </sentence><sentence id="614">And the Americans let us through, we didn't have to -- later on that became much more difficult, but at that point, it was easy. </sentence><sentence id="615">| do want to tell you this, and this was very important. </sentence><sentence id="616">The American and the British, | don't know about the Russian soldiers were extremely nice to us in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="617">When they shipped the <span class="building">American boys home</span>, and they knew the young -- | don't know -- the young, they knew what Americans, | suppose, wanted to do and maybe the British did the same. </sentence><sentence id="618">They wanted to send the war-weary soldiers <span class="building">home</span>, so they sent them <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="619">And then when the new soldiers came in, those who didn't see the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, those who didn't see what we went through, they started fraternizing with the frauleins, with the German girls and they were much nastier to us. </sentence><sentence id="620">They were not so understanding, it was much harder. </sentence><sentence id="621">It was painful, too. </sentence><sentence id="622">So that's -- but, you know, | remember at that time being very angry about it, but | now understand why a little better. </sentence><sentence id="623">But anyway, | went through, we went through to the <span class="region">American zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">| got to <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, turned out that this was not my father, of course. </sentence><sentence id="625">But when | came back, oh, | also want to tell you -- | also want to tell you that the <span class="spatial object">train</span> wasn't always -- then one of the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> that we took on that was really funny. </sentence><sentence id="626">We had -- <span class="country">Germany</span> was devastated. </sentence><sentence id="627">The <span class="populated place">cities</span> were bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="628">The <span class="spatial object">train</span> -- the trip that should have taken maybe, | don't know, 10 hours, we were traveling for a week. </sentence><sentence id="629">We would stop in places, we would stop in <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>, some Jewish inmates would take us in. </sentence><sentence id="630">Then we would go farther. </sentence><sentence id="631">It was a whole undertaking. </sentence><sentence id="632">| remember being, for one stretch of the <span class="dlf">road</span>, we hitched -- we managed to hitch- hike or something, | don't know. </sentence><sentence id="633">We managed to get on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that carried oil or gas, because they were those round -- what do they call them? </sentence><sentence id="634">| suppose, trying to remember. </sentence><sentence id="635">They looked like a big, round <span class="spatial object">barrel</span>, and you couldn't -- there was no way, and the only thing it had like a little <span class="interior space">balcony</span> in front for | suppose the conductors. </sentence><sentence id="636">And | remember Henry and | and his friend, we were sitting on one of those little, it looked like a little <span class="interior space">balcony</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> and Henry lived in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>, and that was a little difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So | finally moved to Brooklyn.| didn't like the lady | lived with, so it was not a pleasant situation. </sentence><sentence id="1716">It was not bad, but | didn't -- so | moved into a much nicer place, where the lady permitted me to use the <span class="spatial object">fridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1717">| could make myself a cup of coffee, a cup of tea. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And eventually, | moved in where Henry stayed. </sentence><sentence id="1719">Henry found a wonderful family, American Jews who came in, their daughter got married. </sentence><sentence id="1720">They had a <span

the Rhineharts for several years, and then we managed to get an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1725">So we moved into this <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and at that point, as | said, | was working. </sentence><sentence id="1726">And Henry, he had started going to <span

</sentence><sentence id="1730">So | think Henry befriended a few -- | think Henry may have had two friends who were American. </sentence><sentence id="1731">It started because they studying together,

even before we were married. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And | would say to him that | am going to -- maybe we should go and see a picture. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And Henry didn't

| did. </sentence><sentence id="2158">| don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Maybe that kind of a thing can be cleared up or helped through some therapy, just to understand that there's no guilt in having survived. </sentence><sentence id="2160">On the contrary, if anything, perhaps a little triumph that Hitler didn't accomplish everything, that somehow we're here. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And, you know, | married and | have a son and a daughter, so, you know, why should | feel guilty about that? </sentence><sentence id="2162">But to go somewhere and try to understand and to make peace with the Holocaust on an emotional level, | don't try and | can't. </sentence><sentence id="2163">When | get a bad dream, when | have a nightmare, | either take a pill or | get up and read a book. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Henry does it all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2165">When he sees his father's face -- he doesn't tell me much, but | know that he was -- the last person, he was <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> with his father, and he can't get rid of that face. </sentence><sentence id="2166">He sees his father with that -- once in a while, he tells me that he sees his father because they were on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> together, and he had this three, four-day, you know, gray growth. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And his father gave him something that he had, they came out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> of <span class="populated place">Le6dz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2168">That was a horrible place to begin with, and so he didn't have much. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Maybe he had some cigars and maybe he had some -- maybe he a silver dollar or something. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And he gave it to Henry and he said, "Take it. </sentence><sentence id="2171">| don't need it anymore." </sentence><sentence id="2172">Or something. </sentence><sentence id="2173">And | know when Henry has that dream or when he sees this, he just gets out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2174">| don't ask him. </sentence><sentence id="2175">Goes down to the <span class="interior space">den</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2176">Take a crime story and he reads. </sentence><sentence id="2177">You can't solve anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="2178">But | needed to solve for myself, | don't mean solve. </sentence><sentence id="2179">| needed to understand how God could permit that. </sentence><sentence id="2180">Now, Henry doesn't have this problem because | think he's an atheist or he" an agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="2181">So he's not asking God how God could allow it. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Insofar as he's concerned, he has an expression, he says, "Shit falls." </sentence><sentence id="2183">Look what's going on all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="2184">There are people killing people in other places. </sentence><sentence id="2185">So maybe in that sense he doesn't have, but | have -- I'm not an agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="2186">| have some kind of a belief, | don't necessarily believe in a Jewish God. </sentence><sentence id="2187">| believe in a Supreme -- | believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="2188">So | have to figure out for myself, | had to, how this could happen. </sentence><sentence id="2189">And they way | have solved it, and | think I've said that perhaps in other places, when | read a book by Dr. Fakenheim (ph), Professor Fakenheim, | think he was a
