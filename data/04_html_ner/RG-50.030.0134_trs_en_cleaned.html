<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: The first 10 years were very -- basically very uneventful. </sentence><sentence id="39">I was told I grew in the midst of the inflation and my parents were middle or upper-middle class and my childhood was very uneventful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: What kind of <span class="building">schools</span> did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I went first in 1928, I started <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, you go to <span class="building">public school</span> for four years and then you switch to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">In 19 -- when I was about 8, in 1930. </sentence><sentence id="48">I started with cello lessons and in 1932, I switched from <span class="building">public school</span> to what was called  <span class="building">Realgymnasium</span>!. </sentence><sentence id="49">The <span class="building">Realgymnasium</span> is something which I don't think we have here. </sentence><sentence id="50">You start -- in your first year, you start with Latin, then in the third year, you get, in addition to Latin, you get French and in the fourth year, in addition to Latin and French, we got English. </sentence><sentence id="51">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> until I decided at the end of December 1937 that it makes no more sense for me to continue <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">When I quit <span class="building">school</span>, I was sent in the what was called <span class="populated place">Obertertia</span>". </sentence><sentence id="53">I would have had three more years to go to make -- to graduate, which was called in <span class="country">Germany</span> abitur". </sentence><sentence id="54">Obviously, everything changed with the advent of Hitler and I have memories that there were the emergency police running around the <span class="populated place">city</span> in their <span class="spatial object">car</span> -- in their <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span> because they were always demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. </sentence><sentence id="55">We had a <span class="interior space">balcony</span> where I could watch this very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="56">We were living on a fairly important <span class="dlf">thoroughfare</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57"><span class="building">School</span> became more difficult with the advent of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="58">I think it was in the second or third grade of <span class="building">high school</span> -- I was about 11 or 12 when the taunting started. </sentence><sentence id="59">And it was harmless -- it wasn't badly meant, but it was grinding, because it went on and it went on and it went on. </sentence><sentence id="60">So, in the <span class="building">school</span> I went to, there was a custom that each -- each class every other year goes together into a <span class="building">youth hostel</span> for three days to play football -- to play soccer, and generally to have a good time. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I picked this particular time to have a fight with one of the guys who were taunting me and I beat him up. </sentence><sentence id="62">I picked one I could handle. </sentence><sentence id="63">And from that moment on, there was peace, not only for me, but also for my other three Jewish classmates. </sentence><sentence id="64">We were four Jews in my <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">I had basically no problem with the exception of one altercation I had with a -- with my German professor. </sentence><sentence id="66">He was a member of the party, if I remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="67">He -- one day we had to write a paper about how we could contribute to the Four Year Plan. </sentence><sentence id="68">That was an economic plan which Goring" was supervising. </sentence><sentence id="69">And when I got the paper back, I got a bad mark with a note that I must have copied this out of a newspaper or a magazine. </sentence><sentence id="70">So I didn't let this sit. </sentence><sentence id="71">Challenged him to show me where I copied it from. </sentence><sentence id="72">Unbeknownst to me, I used American style, "you're innocent until proven guilty." </sentence><sentence id="73">And eventually he had to change the mark. </sentence><sentence id="74">He did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: At the end of December of 1937 we were only two Jewish boys left in my class and very few other Jews in the whole <span class="building">school</span>, and I decided it made no sense to stay in <span class="building">school</span> . </sentence><sentence id="108">I -- I knew I would never go to a <span class="building">university</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">It became more and more difficult, so I told my parents, "Enough is enough. </sentence><sentence id="110">I want out." </sentence><sentence id="111">And I started -- then we compromised and in the  beginning of 19-- immediately at the first few days of 1938, I went into a private, <span class="building">commercial language school</span> where I had French and I had English. </sentence><sentence id="112">I learned German, steno", just to keep me busy. </sentence><sentence id="113">After all, in 1930 -- at the beginning of "38, I was just 17 years old -- not -- no -- 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> there until the famous Crystal Night(r) of 1938 which was the end of <span class="building">school</span> and basically for all German-Jewish children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Can we slow down for just a minute? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: You talk about your experiences as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="128">What was your <span class="building">household</span> like in terms of Jewishness? </sentence><sentence id="129">Was there observance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: We were not observant Jews in the -- in the sense that there was a <span class="building">kosher household</span> or any such thing. </sentence><sentence id="134">My father belonged to a <span class="building">Gesangsverien</span>", which is a singing organization which is very customary in, in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">This one happened to be the Jewish one. </sentence><sentence id="136">And my father was a member of that Board of Directors since almost immediately after World War I. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="137">Incidentally, my father was a soldier in World War I and was a veteran of front service, which permitted me actually to stay -- to stay in <span class="building">high school</span> as long as did, because I believe in 1936 or 1935 already, the children of non-veterans were legislated out of <span class="building">public schools</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="138">So, no we -- I mean we never -- my father also was a member of the legislative body of the Jewish community of <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span> so there was never a question of where we belonged or where we were, but we did not per se be practicing Jews that we went regularly to <span class="building">temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="139">I mean I was Bar Mitzvah, of course, my father would make an appearance as a member of the legislative counsel at least once a year in the <span class="building">temple</span> on, on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="140">I went a few -- I went a number of times on Saturday morning more for social reasons than any other reasons -- we would meet with our friends. </sentence><sentence id="141">And, of course, we had every Friday night, there were -- a different meal with the German version of challah which is called Berches*. </sentence><sentence id="142">And so we were, of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were Jews, but there was no practice -- practicing Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="144">We would not light a <span class="building">home</span> candles for Hanukkah or would have a Seder, not withstanding the fact that for -- for these days, I always went to my uncle and my aunt, my -- the sister of my mother had no children of her own and until they immigrated in 1930 -- early in "34 to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, I was there on all these holidays like Pesach, etceteras, etceteras. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="146">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="147">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="148">By November, then, of 1938, you were a young 17 year old. </sentence><sentence id="149">You were going into this special <span class="building">school</span> waiting for something. </sentence><sentence id="150">What happened as we -- I am sorry -- as we approach Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="152">No, that is okay. </sentence><sentence id="153">Since my father was very active in -- in this what originally started out for 80 or 90 years as a singing organization, was converted in 1933 or 1934, into what was referred to as a Jewish cultural organization. </sentence><sentence id="154">And since we were excluded from everything which had to do with culture, we had our own. </sentence><sentence id="155">In addition to the cause which was a mixed choir, there was an orchestra added, and by the time I was 14 or 15, I was in the orchestra and we did all kinds of opera, opera performances, oratorios. </sentence><sentence id="156">And all this, of course, stopped with the event in of -- at Crystal Night. </sentence><sentence id="157">Incidentally my father at the time of Crystal Night was in <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">His -- one of his <span class="building">companies</span> where he was always the number one salesman, suggested to him since they couldn't employ him anymore in <span class="country">Germany</span>, if he wouldn't want to try to build an existence in <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">We'll come back to this a little later. </sentence><sentence id="160">Let's do it chron--chronologically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Just a point of confusion. </sentence><sentence id="172">You used the word "converted" to a <span class="building">Jewish cultural organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">I wonder if that's what you meant or if you where thinking of the Jewish ethical society. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="178">No. </sentence><sentence id="179">No. </sentence><sentence id="180">I didn't mean the conversion as a -- in a religious sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Okay, I mean, to be clear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I meant it, it used to be a it used to be simply an organization where an orchestra was -- the local orchestra was hired and they would sing concerts. </sentence><sentence id="188">Now we added on a an <span class="spatial object">orchestra</span> and it became a self-sustaining, Jewish cultural organization, where culture was continued parallel to whatever we were able to do with restrictions obviously. </sentence><sentence id="189">We were not permitted to do German composers. </sentence><sentence id="190">We had to restrict ourselves to either foreign composers or Jewish composers so we could not perform after 1934, I think, or "35 -- Bach was out. </sentence><sentence id="191">But we did do Orpheus and Eurydice, by Gluck". </sentence><sentence id="192">We were permitted to do an <span class="populated place">Offenbach</span>"? </sentence><sentence id="193">opera -- operetta. </sentence><sentence id="194">We did Judas, Judas Maccabaeus, by Handel"! </sentence><sentence id="195">and things like this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: What happened as we moved toward <span class="populated place">Kristallnacht</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Crystal Night, I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">This is a <span class="building">commercial school</span> where I went like on every day, and it seems to be I walked on that day. </sentence><sentence id="209">Why I walked and didn't use a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, I cannot remember. </sentence><sentence id="210">But I walked. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I did not really see much of mobs because I was in <span class="building">school</span> at eight o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="212">I saw something which struck me funny. </sentence><sentence id="213">I didn't give it a second thought. </sentence><sentence id="214">I  went to <span class="building">school</span> and around nine or nine-thirty, the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> I was called by the directress and was told, "Your mother has called. </sentence><sentence id="215">You should leave <span class="building">school</span> immediately, and you should go to <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> and you should wait in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> for your cousin who will come separately and you will spend the day in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">When I called <span class="building">home</span> to find out what was going on, I was told, "Don't ask so many stupid questions. </sentence><sentence id="217">Just go to <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> and call me tonight." </sentence><sentence id="218">So <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> being only 10 miles from <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span>, I walked myself over from the <span class="building">school</span> to the. . </sentence><sentence id="219"><span class="building">railway station</span> which was only a 10 minute walk. </sentence><sentence id="220">And on the way I started to realize what was going on in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">I saw <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> being thrown out of <span class="dlf">windows</span> and people being arrested, but since I didn't look Jewish in their sense, nobody bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="222">So I went to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, bought a ticket to <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span>, and 15 minutes later was in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> where I met my cousin and we spent the day in the famous <span class="env feature">Heidelberg woods</span>, walking and there seems to be a -- a faint memory that we were supposed to touch <span class="building">base</span> with a -- I don't know if it was a far relative of my grandmother or just friends. </sentence><sentence id="223">In any case they were of Czech nationality and we were supposed to touch <span class="building">base</span> there to see what was going on and I arranged -- we agreed with my cousin that this would take place around -- after four o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="224">So we walked in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and my cousin got very nervous and wanted to come down much earlier. </sentence><sentence id="225">However, I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="226">We, we said -- we agreed it was four o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="227">We are not going to change the date." </sentence><sentence id="228">Which was very fortunate because by the time I -- we got there or shortly after four o'clock, the man had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="229">If we would have gotten there earlier, we would have probably been arrested to. </sentence><sentence id="230">So we continued walking around in <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> and when I called my mother at seven o'clock, she said she thinks the worst is over. </sentence><sentence id="231">We should come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">Now let me add there that in the beginning of 1938, since nobody knew how long we would have to stay in <span class="country">Germany</span> or would be in <span class="country">Germany</span>, my father was gone and there was no income coming we had given up our own <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and had moved in with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="233">My grandmother happened to be a French citizen which is a story in itself which came about shortly after the war. </sentence><sentence id="234">She wanted to go to <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span>'s twin <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="populated place">Ludwigshafen</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: You mean after World War I? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: After World War I. And when she came -- she was on the <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span> and when she came to the <span class="dlf">rail</span> to the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> across the <span class="env feature">Rhine</span> to <span class="populated place">Lugwigshafen</span>, the French had blocked passage for the day. </sentence><sentence id="266">They did this on occasion. </sentence><sentence id="267">And so my Grandmother descended from the <span class="spatial object">trolley car</span> and was trying to force her way across the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="268">She called the watch commander and explained to him that she is born before the Franco-Prussian War in 1970"? </sentence><sentence id="269">in the <span class="region">Alsace</span> and  therefore, by rights, she is French. </sentence><sentence id="270">And the man happened to be a lawyer and explained to her that in order to become a French citizen again, she would simply have to apply for what was called reinstatement of some kind -- I forgot the French word right now -- which she did . </sentence><sentence id="271">Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or "21 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I, there were no political discussion in her <span class="building">house</span> because my grandmother, not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot. </sentence><sentence id="272">So my Grandmother then applied for reinstatement and became a French citizen. </sentence><sentence id="273">So in 1938, on Crystal Night day, which was November 10th, when the destruction took place, my mother called the <span class="building">French consulate</span> when the sa" started to smash in the back <span class="interior space">loft</span> where my grandmother had <span class="interior space">commercial space</span> rented out to a <span class="building">Jewish store</span> who sold glass -- <span class="spatial object">glass fixtures</span>, <span class="spatial object">electrical glass fixtures</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And this was smashed to millions of bits and when my mother called -- my mother called the <span class="building">French Consulate</span> because after all the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was in the name of my grandmother -- was a large <span class="interior space">apartment</span> -- in order to protect the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> from destruction. </sentence><sentence id="275">And within five or 10 minutes an SA man in uniform came, stopped the carnage in the back <span class="interior space">loft</span> and was posted there all day long in order to protect my grandfather's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> who was after all a French citizen. </sentence><sentence id="276">So I came <span class="building">home</span> in, in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="277">Without a doubt the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was destroyed, but I do remember that one or two days after the 10th of November, I went to <span class="populated place">Ludwigshafen</span> to help a former member of the orchestra straighten out her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which was in, in pitiful shape. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="278"> After Crystal Night 1938, I spent 1939 basically doing nothing. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was nothing I could do. </sentence><sentence id="280">I was reading a book a day and then war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="281">Now I think we should come back to my father. </sentence><sentence id="282">In March of 1938, my father went to <span class="country">Greece</span>, and after a few months was able to start selling his company's goods again which did not sit too well with the German competition. </sentence><sentence id="283">And when they figured out in 1939 who was behind their loss of business which went to another <span class="building">firm</span>, they managed to get my father expelled from <span class="country">Greece</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">My father went, I think in May, from <span class="country">Greece</span> to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="285">In fact, my mother visited him in August of 1939 in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">She had a passport. </sentence><sentence id="287">We all had passports. </sentence><sentence id="288">And at that time was so convinced that nobody would be insane enough to start another war -- this was in August of 1939 -- that she came back <span class="building">home</span> and instead of calling me who also had a passport to join her in <span class="country">Italy</span>, so the family would have been reunited. </sentence><sentence id="289">So my mother came <span class="building">home</span> second my father illegally went from <span class="populated place">Ventimiglia</span> to <span class="populated place">Nice</span>, across <span class="country">country</span> on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> -- on a little <span class="spatial object">boat</span> around the <span class="dlf">border</span> and, of course, did all the things other people did who came in illegally. </sentence><sentence id="290">He was in <span class="building">jail</span> for a few weeks, and then he lived precariously in the <span class="populated place">Nice</span> until he was accidentally until he ran into a German patrol accidentally in, in 1944, and was deported. </sentence><sentence id="291">My mother came back <span class="building">home</span> and on first of September 1939, World War Two broke out. </sentence><sentence id="292">The first thing which happened was that we were called to a <span class="building">Wehrmacht" office</span> where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="293">In other words, we could not serve. </sentence><sentence id="294">We were not -- it was, it was not dignified for Jews to serve in the German, army. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Had he been admitted to the German army. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="297">We had not been admitted to the German army, but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little <span class="building">office</span> and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course, we, we were not mobilized. </sentence><sentence id="298">Then in -- that was in the middle of September. </sentence><sentence id="299">Shortly after that, I was required to perform how would you call this, harvesting service in <span class="region">East Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">That was east of Frank--<span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> on the Oder. </sentence><sentence id="301">It was very far away in those days, it was a trip overnight through <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and then to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> on the Oder, and I was in a small <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">We were quartered in the <span class="interior space">hall</span> where you normally would have weddings. </sentence><sentence id="303">There were they installed <span class="interior space">platforms</span> where we could sleep on. </sentence><sentence id="304">There were about 30 or 40 young people of Jewish -- German Jews, and we helped farmers harvest the sugar beets and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="305">I don't know how much we harvested, but I can assure you every time I hit a -- I made an effort to hit into every potato and every sugar beet I had to dig out. </sentence><sentence id="306">And what was traumatic about this was not that we had to do this, but in <span class="country">Germany</span>, there's a law, on the -- was on the books, probably still on the books -- that when you move from one location to the other, you have to go to the <span class="building">local police precinct</span> and notify them you are going from here to there, so that your records are maintained and, of course, my mother probably worried that if, when I would -- when I come back, there would be trouble. </sentence><sentence id="307">But when we were there six weeks and when I came back, there was no trouble. </sentence><sentence id="308">I just registered again I am back. </sentence><sentence id="309">That was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="310">Then my mother was able to arrange that in on January the third, I think, or second, immediately after the first of the year in -- of 1940, I started to work at the <span class="building">Hilfsverein</span>"". </sentence><sentence id="311">The <span class="building">Hilfsverein</span> was an organization set up by the National Representation of German Jews in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to assist people with their immigration problems and since <span class="country">America</span> was still out of the war at that time, there was -- Jews still could immigrate. </sentence><sentence id="312">German Jews were still able to immigrate to the <span class="country">United States</span> or to <span class="country">Cuba</span> so we had a very busy <span class="building">office</span> and I was working there as a volun--volunteer secretary until we were deported. </sentence><sentence id="313">And in order to be able to work there, I had to travel to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to present myself to the chief of this organization. </sentence><sentence id="314">In the Jewish Reichsvertretung"(r), You know the German Jews had their own organization who represented the Jews with the vis a vis the government and I traveled at night from <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, presented myself in the morning to the chief -- was a man with a beard whose name I don't remember anymore -- and traveled back the same night from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> -- the next, next night from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> back to <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span> which was not very pleasant because my mother decided I should travel second class. </sentence><sentence id="315">It would be more  comfortable since I would not sleep for two nights and all I had in the <span class="interior space">compartment</span> were either officers of the army or SS" officers who were traveling -- it wasn't very funny. </sentence><sentence id="316">But you know I did what my father always did when my father was traveling, as long as he was traveling and working until the end of 1937. </sentence><sentence id="317">He always had Nazi newspapers, so I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="318">I had Nazi newspapers and they left, no--nobody bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="319">So nothing much happened in 1940, until on October 21st around 10 o'clock the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> ran in the <span class="building">office</span> and the chief of my <span class="building">office</span> was at the same time the representative of the <span class="populated place">Mannheim</span> Jewish community with regard to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="320">So at 10 o'clock around the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> rang. </sentence><sentence id="321">The Gestapo was on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> -- he should come down immediately, which he did. </sentence><sentence id="322">He had weekly contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="323">He probably had to report to them on -- on the state of immigration and how people you know people -- we were still able to get a lot of people out. </sentence><sentence id="324">And in fact my own cousin was able to leave through <span class="country">Russia</span>, went to <span class="country">Japan</span>, and managed to get into <span class="populated place">San Francisco</span> before the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="325">So he was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="326">The head of this <span class="building">office</span> came back and told us, "We're going to close up now. </sentence><sentence id="327">We are going to be deported tomorrow to <span class="country">France</span>." </sentence><sentence id="328">And he went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> to notify the president of the <span class="building">Mannheim Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And so eventually around noon, we closed up the <span class="building">community offices</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">We went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">When I came <span class="building">home</span>, I said to my mother, "We are going to pack now because we're going to be sent to <span class="country">France</span> tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="332">And my mother was totally -- couldn't believe this. </sentence><sentence id="333">So I started to pull out <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, started to put stuff together which I wanted to take along and when she saw I was really dead serious about it, she finally -- half-heartedly believed that what I was saying was true, and then after dark, at night, a -- we had a man who worked for us, bringing up coal from the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, when we lived in our own <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">And he came at night surreptitiously, to tell us that he had heard from his friends at the <span class="building">police</span>, that we would be deported tomorrow to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">And then she finally believed it. </sentence><sentence id="336">Unfortunately, why we couldn't -- we were not able to communicate with our friends because <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> were no longer an item for Jewish families after 1939. </sentence><sentence id="337">So we packed and indeed, the next morning the Gestapo rang around eight o'clock and told us that we were arrested and in the name of the people, we should pack what we should take and they would pick us up in a hour which was really two and a half or three hours. </sentence><sentence id="338">So they -- the people were fairly decent. </sentence><sentence id="339">They gave many people enough time to pack, half-way reasonably. </sentence><sentence id="340">They explained we should take stuff along which was warm. </sentence><sentence id="341">We were allowed to take what we can carry, plus 100 marks, plus I believe food for two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="342">They came. </sentence><sentence id="343">They picked us up. </sentence><sentence id="344">We were brought to I think it was a <span class="building">railroad station</span> and then we were loaded into <span class="spatial object">passenger trains</span> no less and this was an action which related to all German Jews in <span class="populated place">Baden</span>, in the <span class="region">State of Baden</span>, and the <span class="region">Palatinate</span>; the two Nazi officials who -- or the Nazi official who was responsible for these two <span class="region">states</span> wanted to be one of he first ones to report that he has no more Jews in his <span class="region">state</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">So we were loaded. </sentence><sentence id="346">We, we went into this special <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and it was one of seven <span class="spatial object">trains</span> which, if I remember right which was to go to <span class="country">France</span> and shortly before we departed, an SS officer appeared in our <span class="spatial object">car</span>  -- why he came to our <span class="spatial object">car</span> I don't know, was haphazardly -- and picked out a man who wore in his lapel a sign which identified him as a, a German war veteran of World War I. He appointed him chief of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">So when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> left, we went first through the <span class="region">Alsace</span> in <span class="populated place">Mulhouse</span> the SS appeared, threatening us and changing -- exchanging our money and telling us that if any money would be found on anybody in excess; of the 100 marks, we were permitted to take the person -- people would be arrested and shot. </sentence><sentence id="348">But nobody -- they never searched anybody, and there were indeed probably a number of people who gambled and had more money on them. </sentence><sentence id="349">So our 100 marks were exchanged for 2000 French francs and then we went on. </sentence><sentence id="350">We came to <span class="populated place">Lyon</span> and apparently, we were the first <span class="spatial object">train</span> so when in <span class="populated place">Lyon</span>, the <span class="spatial object">French gendarmarie</span> which was at the <span class="building">station</span> looked for some spokesman. </sentence><sentence id="351">The man who was appointed the transport chief identified himself and asked me to translate because he didn't speak French. </sentence><sentence id="352">So it turned out these -- the French were not notified by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="353">They were -- the French were told that there are Alsatians coming who don't want to stay under the German rule. </sentence><sentence id="354">But that was all they were told. </sentence><sentence id="355">They didn't know numbers. </sentence><sentence id="356">They didn't know that this was a lie. </sentence><sentence id="357">They were dumbfounded when they found that there were German Jews in this <span class="spatial object">train</span> and this was one <span class="spatial object">train</span> and, of course, they didn't know there were six others coming. </sentence><sentence id="358">So they gave us some food, and then the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went on. </sentence><sentence id="359">Actually, we were deported on the 22nd and we got to <span class="populated place">Oloron</span>, which is the closest <span class="building">railroad station</span> to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> on the 25th, so we were three days in this <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we came -- we arrived in <span class="populated place">Oloron</span> in a down pour which was unbelievable and we were put on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and taken to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, which turned out to be <span class="populated place">Camp de Gurs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">For identification purposes, let's say that <span class="populated place">Camp de Gurs</span> is in the south of <span class="country">France</span> about 40 or 60 miles from the <span class="dlf">Spanish border</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Let's come back to you -- to <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Well, the beginning, of course, was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="472">We didn't -- and the first night, we didn't even have our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">The <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> was brought the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="474">It was just dumped in the rain and we had to pull our -- you know, it was lying in a big <span class="spatial object">pile</span> and he had to find our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">And which I did for both myself and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="476">And so my mother was in one <span class="dlf">block</span> and I was in the other, and there was nothing to do, of course. </sentence><sentence id="477">We could not get out of the <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">And I was here and my mother was a few hundred yards further north in another <span class="dlf">block</span> with the women. </sentence><sentence id="479">And by the time all of the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> had finally arrived there were over 7,000 or 8,000 people in the, in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> for which the authorities had, of course, very little advance warning because nobody knew we were coming. </sentence><sentence id="480">Well, eventually things settled down. </sentence><sentence id="481">Every time it rained people would fall in the <span class="env feature">mud</span>, particularly the old people. </sentence><sentence id="482">The food was abominable. </sentence><sentence id="483">We had very little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="484">The French had nothing to eat, so we had even less. </sentence><sentence id="485">And since a friend of my father was the vice chief of the <span class="dlf">block</span> where I was in, I managed eventually to get myself occupied by working in the <span class="building">office</span> in the -- each <span class="dlf">block</span> had its own <span class="building">administrative office</span> and I managed to work in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="486">The one advantage of this was that it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="487">There was no heating material, but the <span class="building">offices</span> had, of course, more heat so during the day I was reasonably warm while I was working there. </sentence><sentence id="488">And periodically, maybe once or twice a week, you managed to get enough -- a pass to visit members of your family in the other <span class="dlf">block</span> and my mother worked in the <span class="building">block office</span> where she was because the woman who was picked as the chief of the <span class="dlf">block</span> had only one qualification. </sentence><sentence id="489">She spoke fluent French. </sentence><sentence id="490">She was probably the only one who spoke as fluent as French as she did. </sentence><sentence id="491">My mother spoke French obviously, so she managed to be this woman who spoke so fluent French managed to become the block head of the <span class="dlf">block</span> which had benefits. </sentence><sentence id="492">You had a <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">At night the <span class="building">barrack</span> was yours. </sentence><sentence id="494">She had alone -- she lived alone in this big <span class="building">barrack</span> which during the day was the <span class="building">office</span> and somehow or other, all of the block chiefs ate better  1 or most of them. </sentence><sentence id="495">They just took food out of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and life settled down. </sentence><sentence id="496">There wasn't very much to do. </sentence><sentence id="497">Eventually I managed -- we managed to get musical instruments and we started to play a quartet and in this respect, I must say, the French administration, who really showed not very much sympathy organized to have one <span class="building">barrack</span> in each <span class="dlf">block</span> as a cultural, as a <span class="building">cultural barrack</span> so you had lectures. </sentence><sentence id="498">We gave concerts, and for me it was very good because the moment I was a part of a quartet, I had a permanent pass and I could circulate in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="499">And the instruments came from the <span class="building">YMCA</span>"* who, who were with other organizations very active in trying to ameliorate our fate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: What <span class="spatial object">instrument</span> did you play? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: I played cello. </sentence><sentence id="532">I still do. </sentence><sentence id="533">I met my wife in <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="537">Q: Tell me about that meeting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: Oh, my wife worked in, in the -- she was a messenger, I believe, in the, in the <span class="building">office</span> where my mother worked, so when -- I met her when I visited my mother. </sentence><sentence id="540">And eventually the <span class="building">Secours Suisse</span>"", or rather the <span class="building">Swiss Red Cross</span> who had sent a nurse -- Elsbeth Kasser, she is still alive -- set up in a <span class="building">barrack</span>, breakfast for the young generation. </sentence><sentence id="541">And that was really -- I don't remember now if we got it once or if we got it daily or if we got it two or three times a week, but we got a supplementary feeding which helped many of us survive better. </sentence><sentence id="542">So, every morning I would come -- I would -- we were permitted, of course, to leave the -- the <span class="dlf">block</span> for this. </sentence><sentence id="543">We would I would pick up my wife at the end of the -- her <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">We would walk together to the <span class="building">barrack</span> to have our food and come back, and I would see my wife every time when I obviously we weren't married then -- when I would visit my mother or if I came to visit to see her. </sentence><sentence id="545">We met in a -- I met her in, I think, it was December of 1940, so this is now 50 years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="553">Q: What kinds of things were you able to do during the day? </sentence><sentence id="554">Were you able to see your wife during the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="558">We saw each other fairly frequently since I could circulate. </sentence><sentence id="559">She worked. </sentence><sentence id="560">I think she, she will tell you that herself. </sentence><sentence id="561">She was giving out mail. </sentence><sentence id="562">She was running errands. </sentence><sentence id="563">I worked in the <span class="building">office</span> and she was able to leave well before me. </sentence><sentence id="564">She left in, I think, in September of "41. </sentence><sentence id="565">I am not sure about the date. </sentence><sentence id="566">She will tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: We'll take that up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: You take that up with her. </sentence><sentence id="580"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="583">Q: Let's pick up where you -- I am sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: I was still in my <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">However, eventually the French authorities needed to stage an example on -- for everybody's benefit to limit corruption. </sentence><sentence id="587">By corruption I mean the two chiefs in my <span class="dlf">block</span> and one chief's wife were really stealing food from the <span class="dlf">block</span> and lived very well. </sentence><sentence id="588">And there were French inspectors who noticed this and eventually this became -- was very pervasive. </sentence><sentence id="589">I believe it was done in almost every <span class="dlf">block</span> with the exception of one. </sentence><sentence id="590">And the French became concerned with this, so since other things happened about which I am not quite sure what happened. </sentence><sentence id="591">They caught them in all kinds of unethical things. </sentence><sentence id="592">They decided to stage an example and to get rid of these people, the <span class="dlf">block</span> was dissolved. </sentence><sentence id="593">And one morning before some movement of people started, the redistribution of our entire <span class="dlf">block</span> to other <span class="dlf">blocks</span> started. </sentence><sentence id="594">The French inspector who was responsible for our <span class="dlf">block</span>, stood in front of me and asked me if I would do a job for him. </sentence><sentence id="595">The job was I had to inventory -- do the inventory for the whatever little <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> there was. </sentence><sentence id="596">Which I did. </sentence><sentence id="597">It was my first experience with inventory. </sentence><sentence id="598">Little did I know that in my later life, inventory would play a big role because in accounting, inventory is a very important feature. </sentence><sentence id="599">And so when this was done and I had given him all the lists and all the equipment, He said to me, "I will thank you in kind. </sentence><sentence id="600">I will take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="601">Now I don't have something for you at the moment." </sentence><sentence id="602">He knew I was working at the <span class="building">office</span>, of course. </sentence><sentence id="603">Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten that job. " </sentence><sentence id="604">But I will take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="605">So I was put into really a terrible <span class="dlf">block</span> mostly with people who were not from the group of German Jews who were other people who were interned there. </sentence><sentence id="606">And I was there about three weeks, very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="607">Fortunately, I had my pass and I could get out when I wanted to get out to see my mother and.... Well, one day three weeks later, he stood again in front of me, "I haven't forgotten you. </sentence><sentence id="608">I have a job for you. </sentence><sentence id="609">We'll move you to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and you can do the <span class="building">office</span> in the <span class="building">hospital</span>." </sentence><sentence id="610">This was a very privileged position because I shared the -- the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="611">I had a <span class="interior space">room</span> in a <span class="building">barrack</span>, but it was a <span class="interior space">room</span> with a <span class="dlf">door</span> with our own <span class="spatial object">stove</span> with a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="612">Had only a <span class="spatial object">straw mattress</span>, but it was a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> while we slept basically on little <span class="spatial object">wooden platforms</span> which the Spanish refugees had made for us for money with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> where the barbs were taken out and the <span class="dlf">wire</span> was used as, as a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span> support. </sentence><sentence id="613">So there I had a <span class="spatial object">hospital bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">We could light a fire in the evening during the day and I shared the <span class="interior space">room</span> with a man who was really responsible for -- he was really the, the block chief for the <span class="building">hospital</span> to the extent that this was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="615">This was basically the job of accompanying really sick people who had to be evacuated to a <span class="building">hospital</span> to ride the <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span> daily back and forth to either <span class="populated place">Oloron</span>, which was the closest point to a doctor or to the <span class="building">hospital</span> in <span class="populated place">Pau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="616">And eventually I also was able to commute once in awhile out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and with the <span class="spatial object">ambulance</span>, breathe some fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="617">In retrospect, of course, it was stupid I never took my mother along. </sentence><sentence id="618">I -- if | would have taken my mother along and gone with her to <span class="populated place">Pau</span>, we could have managed probably to escape and join my father in <span class="populated place">Nice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="619">But being Germans, it never  3 occurred to us. </sentence><sentence id="620">Eventually in -- I was approached or my mother was approached -- if I could leave -- if there would apply -- a <span class="interior space">space</span> some -- somewhere a place could be found for me if I would be permitted to leave my mother and get -- to get out of <span class="populated place">camp</span> and, of course, she consented to that. </sentence><sentence id="621">And so in probably in July of 1942 after 20 months I left <span class="populated place">camp</span> with the same social worker who escorted Hanne and her group to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, and was bought to <span class="populated place">Talluyers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622"><span class="populated place">Talluyers</span> is a small <span class="populated place">village</span> outside of <span class="populated place">Lyon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">With me was one other young fellow about a year or a year and a half younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="624">And the two of us were brought to a <span class="dlf">farm</span> which was run by the Jewish Boy Scouts of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">It was a <span class="dlf">working farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="626">There were a lot of young people there. </sentence><sentence id="627">The one problem we had with the <span class="dlf">farm</span> was neither he nor I were Orthodox and this was not an <span class="dlf">Orthodox farm</span>, but an <span class="dlf">ultra-Orthodox farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="628">They didn't let us work too much because they knew we were so skinny, we couldn't have worked anyway. </sentence><sentence id="629">And around the end of July, the very end of July, my girlfriend came from <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> having obtained permission to visit her mother and I saw her then for the first time after about a year. </sentence><sentence id="630">And when she came back from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, she came again to tell me that her mother was deported. </sentence><sentence id="631">She could not enter <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">She will tell you that herself. </sentence><sentence id="633">And we arranged then and there that if there would be problems for me that I should try to make my way to where she was because she felt certain that there would be help for anybody who is up there in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="634">Now, you must remember this was -- she was, of course, in 1942, she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on, it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help. </sentence><sentence id="635">What we didn't know was that about a week or two after she had left we -- an announcement was made by the management of the <span class="dlf">farm</span> that they were notified that in about two weeks or two and a half weeks, there would be raids on the <span class="dlf">farm</span> and all the foreign Jews would be arrested, which meant all of us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="636">But not to worry, that we would be helped by hiding. </sentence><sentence id="637">But when the time came to disperse everybody, help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="638">What was interesting is that these people who were running the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis, who were in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> who are mentioned by name in, in -- as being very helpful while they were in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> -- in a book by Schramm" about her experiences in <span class="populated place">Gurs</span> and but there was no help for us. </sentence><sentence id="639">We were told, "Do what you feel is right. </sentence><sentence id="640">Go wherever you want to go." </sentence><sentence id="641">And that was the end for that. </sentence><sentence id="642">So my friend and I from <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>, <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>, we went to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, which wasn't so far away from there, because all we knew Hanne had explained to us, we leave to go to <span class="populated place">Saint Etienne</span> and in <span class="populated place">Saint Etienne</span> I believe there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> going up to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: On the <span class="populated place">camp</span> management, well the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- I want to make sure this is clear. </sentence><sentence id="702">The <span class="populated place">camp  4</span> management did take care of everybody except you four. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: The farm management. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="707">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: Took care -- took care of all of the other people. </sentence><sentence id="710">In fact, I understand that most of these people today are in <span class="country">Israel</span>, including the principals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: What, what was the life like for you on that <span class="dlf">farm</span> for those two or three weeks you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: It was probably 5, four or five weeks. </sentence><sentence id="716">I have a very hazy recollection. </sentence><sentence id="717">I really don't remember much. </sentence><sentence id="718">It was obviously much better than it was in <span class="populated place">camp</span> but you know, I am not the one who is at ease in any <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="719">I am not the type. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: Let's hold it for a moment and let us change tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="728"> 5 TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: ...And you know, I have talked with other people about this and they really said that they're not surprised because the Germans are very rigid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: What a minute. </sentence><sentence id="732">Hold on. </sentence><sentence id="733">Is the tape rolling again? </sentence><sentence id="734">We're back on for an hour? </sentence><sentence id="735">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="736">We're back on. </sentence><sentence id="737">Just one minute. </sentence><sentence id="738">I think we should finish this and we should finish this and I think we should finish it on the tape. </sentence><sentence id="739">Will you tell us on tape about the incident in <span class="populated place">New York</span> please that you were describing to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="750">but to -- to finish up with the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="751">We were -- Hanne and I and our daughter was in, in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="752">We were in <span class="populated place">New York</span> only a very short time, a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="753">We were walking down <span class="dlf">Broadway</span>, pushing the <span class="spatial object">baby carriage</span> when we ran into the two rabbis who were in <span class="populated place">Talluyers</span> and whom al-- of course, we also knew from <span class="populated place">Gurs</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="759">Q: These are the two rabbis who had refused to help you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: These are the two rabbis who did, did nothing to help. </sentence><sentence id="762">And their reaction was actually very interesting because if they could have sunk into the <span class="env feature">earth</span> to disappear when they saw us and we started to talk with them for a minute or two, they would have really disappeared because they visibly had a bad conscience when they saw us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="766">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="767">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="768">So you left the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: So, we left the <span class="dlf">farm</span> early in the morning and by 10 o'clock at night, we were in the <span class="building">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: Did you have help in getting to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="777">We took, we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: Okay? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="781">A: We had a few francs, and we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Well, it was 10 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="786">Where I am going to find Hanne at 10 o'clock at night? </sentence><sentence id="787">I don't even know where she is. </sentence><sentence id="788">So, we decided we're going to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="789">There was a little <span class="dlf">wooded opening</span> in the middle of nowhere, and we decided that we are going to put our <span class="spatial object">sleeping bags</span> down and we're going to sleep there. </sentence><sentence id="790">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="791">Around four-thirty, five o'clock, five-fifteen in the morning, we hear -- we had just woken up and we had just folded up our <span class="spatial object">sleeping bags</span> when we hear girls" voices passing on the <span class="dlf">path</span> where we were in the in the little <span class="env feature">wood</span> and who walked by? </sentence><sentence id="792">Hanne! </sentence><sentence id="793">With a few of the teenage girls who were with her in the little  6 children's <span class="building">home</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="794"> And so I whistled after her because I had to run first to, to catch her and she absolutely refused to turn around. </sentence><sentence id="795">Her girlfriend, who knew me, saw me and tried to stop Hanne walking on and so eventually she physically turned her around. </sentence><sentence id="796">There was I was. </sentence><sentence id="797">So Hanne took us to <span class="building">Madame Andre Philip</span>" , who she apparently -- she knew her, and she figured she would be a logical person to, to help. </sentence><sentence id="798">So Mireille asked her only one </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: Can she trust me? </sentence><sentence id="800">Hanne said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="801">He's my boyfriend." </sentence><sentence id="802">And so Madame Phillip took me to a <span class="building">villa</span> where I stayed overnight and in the meantime, obviously, she had to find a place for me to stay. </sentence><sentence id="803">And so the next night I walked about an hour and a half at night to a <span class="dlf">farm</span> like the <span class="dlf">farms</span> which are -- were shown on the movie by Pierre Sauvage, typical <span class="dlf">farm</span> like this to a farmer whose name I don't know to this day. </sentence><sentence id="804">If I knew it, I forgot it but I don't know the name. </sentence><sentence id="805">Was aman, maybe in his late 40s. </sentence><sentence id="806">He looked old to me because he had a gray beard already, and his wife, and a teenage daughter and since <span class="dlf">farms</span>, <span class="interior space">living spaces</span> very restricted because most is given over to animals and to hay he put me into the <span class="interior space">hayloft</span>, and I must say the man was very practical. </sentence><sentence id="807">The first thing he did, he cut a <span class="dlf">hole</span> at the end of the <span class="interior space">hayloft</span> into the where you would normally put a, a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="808">He put a <span class="dlf">hole</span> there which led right down to the -- where the animals were so that I have -- would have my, my <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="809">It was the first thing he did, took a saw and cut out the <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="810">And I spent three and a half weeks in the <span class="interior space">hayloft</span>. </sentence><sentence id="811">I got my breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="812">I got my lunch, which I ate in the <span class="interior space">hayloft</span>. </sentence><sentence id="813">They brought it. </sentence><sentence id="814">And I came down for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="815">I ate dinner with them in their <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="816">You know every night was a wonderful dinner for the times -- was potato soup with lard and milk poured into the soup and some vegetable. </sentence><sentence id="817">And what really these three and a half weeks with this farmer permitted me eventually to gain enough physical strength to get out of <span class="country">France</span> through the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> which wasn't so easy, was a physical, great physical exercise. </sentence><sentence id="818">In fact, the only literature I had in, in this <span class="interior space">hayloft</span> for three and half was a New Testament. </sentence><sentence id="819">That's all he had in the <span class="building">house</span> so he gave it to me and I read it. </sentence><sentence id="820">And I thought already, "They must have forgotten I am here." </sentence><sentence id="821">I didn't hear from anybody. </sentence><sentence id="822">I didn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="823">I was totally alone with these farm people for three and a half weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="849">Q: You didn't see Hanne? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="850">Q: No, Hanne was -- in fact, Hanne during this period was hiding herself most of the time with another farmer because there were raids going on all over the so-called <span class="region">unoccupied zone</span> of <span class="country">France</span> and the people were being arrested and deported. </sentence><sentence id="851">So one day the farmer brought me a little note from Hanne so at least I knew, aside from hearing from Hanne, I knew that people knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="852">And lo and behold a few days later at right somebody came to pick me up to bring me back to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">I slept in the same <span class="building">villa</span> where I was -- when I was  7 brought. </sentence><sentence id="854">The next day Madame Philip, and I saw Hanne, of course, who had come back at the same time too apparently, and Madame Philip explained to me that they are going to make photograph of me, giving me false papers and will help me to get across <span class="country">France</span> to the <span class="env feature">French Alps</span> and from there I would be helped into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="855">So they had -- the papers were made. </sentence><sentence id="856">I got them at night. </sentence><sentence id="857">And the next morning I set off with three other young fellows from, from <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="858">In a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, regular <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, we went across that portion of <span class="country">France</span> into the <span class="env feature">French Alps</span> and we stopped -- I don't remember the name of the place. </sentence><sentence id="859">One - - I believe it was one stop before <span class="populated place">Saint Gervais</span> -- in the <span class="env feature">French Alps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="860">There a 10 year old boy picked us up, brought us to the <span class="building">home</span> of his father. </sentence><sentence id="861">We met there a, a young Protestant minister who was supposed to go with us when we would cross the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> to learn the <span class="dlf">route</span> so that he would help people later on go the same <span class="dlf">route</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="874"> So the next morning we set off. </sentence><sentence id="875">Our guide was this 10 year old boy who knew these, these <span class="env feature">mountains</span> like his back pocket. </sentence><sentence id="876">The priest and the four of us, the minister and the four of us and we climbed all day until it was night. </sentence><sentence id="877">We stayed -- it was raining at night -- we stayed under an <span class="dlf">overhang</span> under a <span class="env feature">rock</span> so we were dry and we -- I was even able to sleep even. </sentence><sentence id="878">And we continued the next day and sometimes maybe at eight o'clock, we started very early, and sometimes during the morning the boy said, "Now, from here on, you are on your own." </sentence><sentence id="879">He explained to us where we had to go. </sentence><sentence id="880">He told us we would have to go down this <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="881">We were about -- I don't now -- .somewhere around the 9,000 foot level probably, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, well above the <span class="env feature">tree line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="882">He explained to us where we should go and said we would come into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="883">They also told us -- the minister told us, we should get rid of our false identification cards because they were afraid that if the Swiss find false papers on us, they might suspect an organized effort behind this and would immediately return us. </sentence><sentence id="884">Well we, we climbed most of the day down, eventually ended up on a <span class="dlf">highway</span> which was totally deserted, and walked on this <span class="dlf">highway</span> further down, descended through a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> and in the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> we were stopped by a patrol who had -- as they told us when they brought us back to the -- to a <span class="building">mountain hut</span> where we found another 30 or 40 people which were gone during the day. </sentence><sentence id="885">They told us that they had watched for hours with their glasses coming down. </sentence><sentence id="886">The next morning we were, we were able to buy -- I had one or two Francs. </sentence><sentence id="887">It was enough to buy some breakfast in this <span class="building">mountain hut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="888">All of us were told that we would be returned to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="889">We would not be kept. </sentence><sentence id="890">A detachment of soldiers started to bring us back up into what is -- what they called <span class="region">no man's land</span>, from where we would descend again to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="891">Now we came into <span class="country">France</span> -- into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, in the <span class="env feature">valley</span> not far from <span class="populated place">Finhaut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="892">I was able to determine this later where I was. </sentence><sentence id="893">And I managed also in the morning during breakfast to look at the <span class="spatial object">map</span> and I had somebody show me from the Swiss where we were. </sentence><sentence id="894">So I knew exactly where I was. </sentence><sentence id="895">So a detachment of soldier--soldiers took us back up into the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, well above the <span class="dlf">tree line</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="896">And then something very extraordinary happened during this hike up the <span class="env feature">mountain</span>. </sentence><sentence id="897">All of a sudden, a non-commissioned Swiss soldier started  8 to scream at me and tiraded me for about 15 minutes, screamed at me what I'm not permitted to do: I'm not permitted to come back to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, I'm not permitted to do this, I am not permitted to do that. </sentence><sentence id="898">What the man really did in these 15 minutes, he laid out for me but exactly how to go back to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="899">All I had to do is subtract the word "not." </sentence><sentence id="900">The tragedy was that everybody in our group heard this. </sentence><sentence id="901">Nobody understood what this man was trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="902">So eventually the captain of -- of this detachment stopped and told us that they would stay here and we should go on. </sentence><sentence id="903">So the first thing I did was -- we went on. </sentence><sentence id="904">We went across a <span class="dlf">bend</span>, around the <span class="dlf">bend</span>, where I was sure the Swiss couldn't see us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="905">Then I stopped the whole group and I explained to them what just had transpired, and they had all heard it. </sentence><sentence id="906">And we argued this out for an hour and nobody understood -- had understood what this was all about and these people were so shaken that after an hour of talking with them, I finally found one person who was willing to see the -- my logic and my reasoning that we know what's down there and all we do is possibly waste another day, but we also may -- might save our lives. </sentence><sentence id="907">So this one fellow and I separated from the group, and the rest went down and I went back towards <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="908">We crossed a little icy <span class="env feature">stream</span> coming down, which was a <span class="dlf">glacier border</span>, you know, but not further than a few like this. </sentence><sentence id="909">Was very narrow because it had only started a little further up, and we climbed further up and all of a sudden we were on a very, very narrow <span class="dlf">path</span> and the fellow who was with me who didn't know really where he was -- an Austrian, I never saw him again after, after we separated in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> -- wanted to go to the right and I wanted to go down to the left. </sentence><sentence id="910">And I said, "When -- look when you go to the right, you're going nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="911">You're going back to <span class="country">France</span> possibly." </sentence><sentence id="912">But in order to convince him, I said, "Alright. </sentence><sentence id="913">Let's walk to the right the way you want to walk because I am sure you will, will end up nowhere." </sentence><sentence id="914">And lo and behold, after five minutes, we were abruptly at the <span class="dlf">precipice</span> down 1,000 or 3,000 feet, was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="915">So, he finally believed me and we turned around and we walked the same <span class="dlf">path</span>. </sentence><sentence id="916">We came back and eventually this very narrow little <span class="dlf">path</span> became wider and became wider, became a little <span class="dlf">road</span> and we eventually came into a little <span class="populated place">village</span> which was <span class="populated place">Finhaut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="917">Now I had no Swiss money. </sentence><sentence id="918">He still had some. </sentence><sentence id="919">And we had been told in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> already that if we need help we should look for a Protestant minister. </sentence><sentence id="920">If there's no Protestant minister, go to the Catholic priest. </sentence><sentence id="921">They probably will help you. </sentence><sentence id="922">So I went to <span class="building">church</span>, to the <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="923">There was a <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="924">Yeah, but the priest wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="925">He was -- had gone into the <span class="env feature">valley</span> for the day. </sentence><sentence id="926">So we went on and it became dusk. </sentence><sentence id="927">I didn't want to stay in <span class="populated place">Finhaut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="928">It was too big for me. </sentence><sentence id="929">So it became eventually dark and we walked and we came through another few -- a <span class="populated place">village</span> of maybe 10 or 15 <span class="building">houses</span> and I looked around and I said, "I don't want to sleep in the open again tonight." </sentence><sentence id="930">I had slept two nights before in the open -- in the rain. </sentence><sentence id="931">So I picked a <span class="building">house</span> which I thought looked friendly and just knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and a man peers out. </sentence><sentence id="932">I explained to him, "We are <span class="building">refuges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="933">Could we stay over for the night?" </sentence><sentence id="934">And he said, Well, he's newly-wed. </sentence><sentence id="935">It's not his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">It's a <span class="building">house</span> of his brother-in-law, but why don't we wait. </sentence><sentence id="937">"T'll, I'll ask him." </sentence><sentence id="938">Well, after five minutes, he came back, "Come on in." </sentence><sentence id="939">They gave us food. </sentence><sentence id="940">They gave us a <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="941">They gave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where we were and where we should go, so we walked most of the day and, and he also told  9 us not to go to <span class="populated place">Martigny</span> -- which was the next larger place -- because <span class="populated place">Martigny</span> was a <span class="building">garrison</span> <span class="populated place">city</span> with <span class="building">military police</span> all over. </sentence><sentence id="942">So -- and military all over. </sentence><sentence id="943">We would probably get, get stopped. </sentence><sentence id="944">So we went to -- he showed us a way how to go to the next <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="945">I don't remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="946">And by then it was already two or three o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="947">Here we had walked all day to come down and then I went again to the Catholic priest's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="948">He gave us two eggs to eat, which was something because there was strict rationing in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and he gave me five francs which was enough to go by <span class="dlf">railroad</span> to <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span>, the next bigger <span class="populated place">city</span>, where I wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="949">And he also told me, "Don't go with the express <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">The <span class="spatial object">express train</span> is checked by military police. </sentence><sentence id="951">Go with the <span class="spatial object">local train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="952">And lo and behold, we got to <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="953">Nobody had bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="954">Then I was in <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span> in the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and I really, for a moment, didn't know what to do with myself until about 15 or 20 -- we were wondering aimlessly around this -- this <span class="building">railroad station</span> until I realized, "You are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="955">God, why don't you look in the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> for the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="956">I went to the <span class="spatial object">telephone book</span>. </sentence><sentence id="957">The other guy wasn't much help. </sentence><sentence id="958">He followed. </sentence><sentence id="959">And lo and behold, the <span class="populated place">Jewish Community</span> was <span class="dlf">Rue de la Gare</span> -- it's the <span class="dlf">railroad street</span>, the <span class="dlf">station street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="960">So we went out of the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> and within one or two minutes, we were -- we walked into the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, who welcomed us and told us, "Now look, we have to turn you over to the Swiss authorities, but don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="961">You will not be returned." </sentence><sentence id="962">These people had not known, of course. </sentence><sentence id="963">I had never told anybody that I had been arrested and, and the Swiss who were up in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> did not take apparently our names down, did not report it, so nobody knew apparently, as it turned out, that I had been 48 hours or 24 hours before already in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and was returned. </sentence><sentence id="964">So we were turned over to the <span class="building">military</span>. </sentence><sentence id="965">We were kept for a few days in the <span class="building">barrack</span> at <span class="populated place">Ouchy</span>, which is a suburb of <span class="populated place">Lausanne</span>, where we had to fill out long questionnaires and were interrogated by some investigators who fortunately did not speak German and my Austrian friend with whom I had come did not speak French or very little French, so I was translating the way it suited me from what he said, to what I told the guy, so he never knew anything what I didn't want him to know. </sentence><sentence id="966">And from <span class="populated place">Ouchy</span>, we were taken to a quarantine, <span class="populated place">military camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="967">You can't call it a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="968">It was in the <span class="interior space">back room</span> of a <span class="building">local inn</span>, where they had made matt-- you know, <span class="spatial object">platforms</span> to sleep on. </sentence><sentence id="969">And they fed us, and the food was good. </sentence><sentence id="970">There was nothing wrong. </sentence><sentence id="971">It wasn't, wasn't French food. </sentence><sentence id="972">It was at least -- and we were there from September after -- oh yeah, end of September, October first maybe until about four weeks and then four weeks later, we were transferred to another identical <span class="building">facility</span> on the other end of <span class="country">Switzerland</span> in the German part of <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and there I was for another four weeks probably. </sentence><sentence id="973">And on December 22nd, 1942 I was given papers to a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> again in the <span class="region">French part</span> of <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="974">And when I came there in the early afternoon, the only person in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was the camp director. </sentence><sentence id="975">It was then a <span class="populated place">civilian camp</span> -- was <span class="populated place">internment camp</span> with <span class="building">barracks</span>, but it was a <span class="populated place">civilian camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">The  0 only person there was a director of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> who had -- with his wife and his small child at the time, who not that small -- the daughter was maybe 12 or 13. </sentence><sentence id="977">Everybody else was on leave somewhere in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="978">So the first question was, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="979">I said, "I was assigned here" "You have any family somewhere in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="980">I said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="981">I have a cousin here." " </sentence><sentence id="982">Let's call him. </sentence><sentence id="983">Maybe you can go there." </sentence><sentence id="984">So I came from, from almost the <span class="dlf">border</span> of, of the <span class="dlf">Swiss-German border</span> and I went practically back to the same place because my cousin lived very close by. </sentence><sentence id="985">And I spent three days or four days with my cousin during the Christmas holidays and then I came back to <span class="populated place">camp</span> and I started <span class="populated place">camp</span> life in, in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: How long were you there and what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1133">What was life like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Well, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was set up really to clear <span class="env feature">land</span>, to make <span class="region">land</span> arable because there was a great shortage of food in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1137">You know, they had to be more or less self supporting and I am really not familiar with the dates. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We can -- I can show you the dates afterwards on my -- when we take a photo of the identifications -- Swiss identification papers. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Well, when I came back, it had snowed. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There were about two or three feet of <span class="env feature">snow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And the first thing we had to do was to clear the <span class="dlf">road</span> from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to the <span class="dlf">street</span> -- to the main <span class="dlf">highway</span> and I didn't very much appreciate this. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I don't like physical labor. </sentence><sentence id="1143">So I decided at that point already that this is not for me. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I got to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I managed to get, within two weeks, I was in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1146">They needed somebody in the <span class="building">office</span> because there was a great deal of administrative work to be done on a daily basis. </sentence><sentence id="1147">There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way  1 in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was entitled to, so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So I went into the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And I was in <span class="building">offices</span> in <span class="populated place">refuge camps</span> or <span class="building">homes</span> for the rest of my Swiss stay for five and one half years. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I was in -- the only time I was out was a few months while I was -- where I was in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> where I took some social services courses. </sentence><sentence id="1151">We -- one did not know what would be. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I had no profession basically. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So when the opportunity came to take some courses in social service, I took the opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I was put in the <span class="building">pension</span> in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> and I took these courses. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Incidentally, we also got married during this period in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1176">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Tell, tell me about that. </sentence><sentence id="1178">How did you meet up again with Hanne and how did you--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1182">A: Well, Hanne came in February of -- February 28, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1183">She will tell you she came a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1184">The difference between her and me was that I came and remained an illegal alien in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> for the entire five and a half years we were in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> while the moment Hanne set foot on <span class="env feature">Swiss soil</span>, she was legal because her relatives had procured a Swiss visa. </sentence><sentence id="1185">We managed to get permission after I was married. </sentence><sentence id="1186">After all, I knew the ropes, how to do these things. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I was in the <span class="building">offices</span> all this time. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I got permission to bring her .with me, to live with me. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Then eventually they decided since she is really not an internee, and a -- but a legal foreigner, she could not live with me. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Then we had to go through the charade of having a <span class="interior space">room</span>, renting a <span class="interior space">room</span> in <span class="populated place">Montreux</span> would cost a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We had to pay for the <span class="interior space">room</span>, which she didn't use once. </sentence><sentence id="1192">She stayed with me in, in the <span class="building">home</span> where I was. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Eventually, we were able to give up the <span class="interior space">room</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And after the social services course we came -- I went back to a <span class="building">refuge home</span> in the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I was assigned again to an <span class="building">office</span>, to run an <span class="building">office</span> and she came along. </sentence><sentence id="1196">By the way, while I was, while I was in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> and Hanne was in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> -- and the circumstances of Hanne staying in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> she will tell you herself -- we, all of a sudden, we are approached by -- now I can't think of the name of the man -- by a German Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I believe he was Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And we were not married at the time yet. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Hanne will probably supply the name. </sentence><sentence id="1200">I can't think of it right now. </sentence><sentence id="1201">He invited us for tea twice, and he was really trying to recruit us. </sentence><sentence id="1202">The war would end soon. </sentence><sentence id="1203">It was in 1944 or early 1945, and why wouldn't we come to <span class="region">East Germany</span> where the Russians were to help build up <span class="region">East Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1204">And we got into a rather lengthy discussion twice about the merits of going into an authoritarian dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="1205">I pointed out to <span class="region">Siberia</span> and the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="region">Siberia</span> which the man tried not to play down, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And eventually, I made -- we made it clear to him that we are not interested. </sentence><sentence id="1207">What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later, we are reading an obituary in the <span class="building">New York Times</span> about the right hand of Mr. Brandt"", who was German Prime Minister, and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war, he came back to <span class="region">East Germany</span>, eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities, was in <span class="region">Siberia</span>, somehow when he was released managed to get to <span class="region">West Germany</span> and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt. </sentence><sentence id="1208">So,  2 Hanne and I got married in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> in -- on April 14, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Our daughter was born in March of 1946, and in 1948 in -- after we had obtained our visas for the <span class="country">United States</span>, we came here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1239">Q: Where did you go once you came here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1241">A: We came to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and we stayed in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1242">In the beginning, you know, I was told, "Go to HIAS(tm), Maybe they can help you." </sentence><sentence id="1243">And we went, and the suggestion was made, "Why don't you go to <span class="populated place">Pritoria</span> -- <span class="populated place">Peoria</span> ?" </sentence><sentence id="1244"><span class="populated place">Peoria</span>, <span class="region">Illinois</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Well, first, of course, no where -- I didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1246">For the first two weeks so I permitted myself the question, "Who's going to pay for all of this?" " </sentence><sentence id="1247">Well, your relatives, of course." </sentence><sentence id="1248">So, we never went to <span class="populated place">Peoria</span>, <span class="region">Illinois</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1249">We stayed in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1259">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1271">A: Yeah, I realize that. </sentence><sentence id="1272">We will, we will Hanne her passports and I will just show mine, my two. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And then we'll show the travel document yet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: My notes say here that you succeeded in returning to <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1278">When are you talking about? </sentence><sentence id="1279">You talked -- when we talked, before the interview, you said -- you described the 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="1280">You're just talking about a later visit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1285">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1286">That is much, much -- No. </sentence><sentence id="1287">That is five years ago, four years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1291">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1293">That's all I needed to make sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1297">A: It's not of consequence to-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1299">Q: I just needed to be very clear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1301">A: This is my <span class="interior space">internal refugee pass</span> for <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1302">It contained identification with a picture. </sentence><sentence id="1303">It shows--  3 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1315">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1319">A: It shows that there were always periods given in which we are permitted to remain in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1320">It was always a year or so and then it had to be renewed, which was a formality because they know, they know we couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1321">It shows here, for instance, that we were interned by order of the police -- the federal police really. </sentence><sentence id="1322">This is the record of all of the <span class="populated place">refugee camps</span> and the <span class="building">homes</span> where I was in from. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And it finally has pages which shows what rationing cards were issued to me. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Because after all, the Swiss are worse bureaucrats than the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Now finally, on this page are three numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1326">One is a number which -- under which I went while I was interned in these <span class="populated place">camps</span> or <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Actually I was more in formal <span class="building">hotels</span> which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed. </sentence><sentence id="1328">One of those numbers is a <span class="building">police department</span> number from the <span class="building">federal police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1329">My -- I had an aunt who lived in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, who was married in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, who gave on the occasion of one of her visits a passport application where we had tried for me to come to <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> to study at the <span class="building">conservatory of music</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And as we discovered, this was a number which was given to me by the Swiss when I became -- when I came into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Not only this, but when Hanne married me, all of sudden she -- this same number turned up on her refugee pass. </sentence><sentence id="1332">We never were told anything about it, but you know the Swiss are very subtle. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And since we had to fill out when we came a questionnaire of maybe 30 pages, they were able to trace back who we were and they matched my passport application from 1939 to my arrival in 1942 in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Now, the other thing I wanted to show yet is the passport I used or we were issued in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> since we refused to accept German papers. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I did not want a German passport. </sentence><sentence id="1336">I wanted no part of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1337">So this is the Swiss travel document which was used for us to obtain our American visa which is in here. </sentence><sentence id="1338">It's just like a regular <span class="spatial object">passport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1339">It had our transit visa and our immigration visa. </sentence><sentence id="1340">This is the immigration visa into the <span class="country">United States</span> signed by the same man who had been promoted from Vice Consul to Consul who in <span class="country">Germany</span> gave untold people untold trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1341">I don't know if this ever was mentioned in an interview, but to obtain a immigration visa in those days in <span class="country">Germany</span> was an extremely harrowing experience. </sentence><sentence id="1342">Any pretext would be used to deny a visa. </sentence><sentence id="1343">People would come with their children. </sentence><sentence id="1344">The child might have bumped her arm or his leg and there would be a blue mark. </sentence><sentence id="1345">This was enough, during the physical examination which was given in the <span class="building">Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span> and in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, to reject an application or to postpone an application for three, or four, or five months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
