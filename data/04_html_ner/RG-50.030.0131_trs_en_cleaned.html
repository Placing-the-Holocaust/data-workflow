<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: We were there for about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="252">And then when the war started between <span class="country">Russia</span> and...and <span class="country">Germany</span>, that's when they liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="253">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="254">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Armny--to fight against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="255">Which my two brothers did. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we went to <span class="country">Kazakhstan</span>, which is a warm climate. </sentence><sentence id="257"><span class="country">Kazakhstan</span>, <span class="country">Uzbekistan</span> is near <span class="country">Iran</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

The <span class="building">Red Cross</span> said...being we were Polish citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour. </sentence><sentence id="268">So, of course, we didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="269">My mother sold it. </sentence><sentence id="270">And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">You know, just to get away. </sentence><sentence id="272">Food was...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="290">You didn't just... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Well, there was also a big <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="295">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="296">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much <span class="interior space">room</span>, so many shoes. </sentence><sentence id="297">Because my brother once worked in a <span class="building">bakery</span>; so he used to work at night. </sentence><sentence id="298">So we had only one pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="299">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older. </sentence><sentence id="300">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="301">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="302">So...but I used to work. </sentence><sentence id="303">We used to cut <span class="populated place">saxaul</span> (ph) all day. </sentence><sentence id="304">Grows a certain <span class="dlf">branch</span> over there, it's called <span class="building">saxhaul</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="305">And this is like corn, you know. </sentence><sentence id="306">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="307">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive. </sentence><sentence id="308">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to <span class="country">Germany</span>, he would send a package to us. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was already after the war. </sentence><sentence id="310">So we should survive. </sentence><sentence id="311">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: You could save money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Well, we could...just for the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride; because they wouldn't give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="336">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: What were living conditions like in <span class="populated place">Tashkent</span>? </sentence><sentence id="346">Where did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Being as tropical...you know, tropical climate, it dries. </sentence><sentence id="355">And this was...we made bricks, and we would build a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="356">And then we would make a <span class="interior space">room</span>...a <span class="building">house</span>...a <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">That's about it. </sentence><sentence id="358">And then we would make a <span class="dlf">roof</span> from the <span class="env feature">straw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">And that's it. </sentence><sentence id="360">So if it got cooler, we would sleep inside; but during the summer, we would sleep outside on <span class="spatial object">mats</span>, straw mats. </sentence><sentence id="361">Because natives even there, that's how they live. </sentence><sentence id="362">The Uzbeks, that's how they live. </sentence><sentence id="363">They sleep outside. </sentence><sentence id="364">They eat on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">So we tried to imitate them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Speaking of the <span class="populated place">Uzbecks</span>, what were your relationships like with them? </sentence><sentence id="384">The Russians? </sentence><sentence id="385">What was the relationship with the Uzbeks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: Well, we didn't see too many. </sentence><sentence id="390">Not in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="391">Well, the Uzbeks are... Well, first of all, we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="392">We spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="393">They don't. </sentence><sentence id="394">And they are very family-oriented. </sentence><sentence id="395">So they were together, and they were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="396">And they grow over there melons, all kind of melons. </sentence><sentence id="397">And we lived on the <span class="env feature">melons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">We did get a little piece of <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and we used to grow melons. </sentence><sentence id="399">And uh that's how we lived. </sentence><sentence id="400">They showed us. </sentence><sentence id="401">They were very nice to us, the Uzbeks. </sentence><sentence id="402">And they showed us how to grow, because we didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="403">And here again, we waited to go <span class="building">home</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="404">laughter) It was one <span class="dlf">line</span>, but then they started... A lot of Russians came when <span class="country">Germany</span> started to come into <span class="country">Russia</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="405">They started to occupy <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="406">They had a lot of <span class="country">Russia</span> people coming from <span class="populated place">Kiev</span>, [from] <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="407">They used to bring the women, the children; and the men used to go to the front. </sentence><sentence id="408">So that's when we saw a lot of Russian people there. </sentence><sentence id="409">But everybody was hungry there. </sentence><sentence id="410">Even they were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="411">Because there was not too much. </sentence><sentence id="412">There was...Everybody had to stay with that 400 gram of bread, even the people that were born there. </sentence><sentence id="413">And that's sad. </sentence><sentence id="414">So that's what it is. </sentence><sentence id="415">But, of course, what my husband went through... It's...You cannot... But we had, because every time like... You know, every time my sister, she would have a dress. </sentence><sentence id="416">And then she would see--because she was the oldest--she would see that us kids that we were hungry or something. </sentence><sentence id="417">So she would take off that dress and go on the <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">And sell it, and get--sell it for bread, not money. </sentence><sentence id="419">And bring <span class="building">home</span> a little bread. </sentence><sentence id="420">So then, after a year and a half, there was nothing to sell no more. </sentence><sentence id="421">And she got... (Laughing) You know, she was left with her petticoat, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="422">But, Thank God, we all survived. </sentence><sentence id="423">I...my sisters and brothers live in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>, and we are happy to be in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">What can I tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
