<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: Tell me more about what your...what a day was like in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>? </sentence><sentence id="398">From the morning "til night. </sentence><sentence id="399">What was a day like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: Well, we would get up very early, even before the sun... sunrise. </sentence><sentence id="404">And immediately...and eat and get a uh uh substance that was called "coffee," which was made out of the bark uh of a...some <span class="env feature">tree</span>, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="405">I mean, it was bitter but it was black, you know. </sentence><sentence id="406">And it was bitter, and...that's it. </sentence><sentence id="407">Now if you have saved uh some bread from the day before, then you're lucky and you'll eat that uh that piece bread before going to work. </sentence><sentence id="408">But if not, then you just drank that coffee. </sentence><sentence id="409">And then immediately you were thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="410">Regardless of weather, you thrown out uh...outside and you'd have to stay and wait for a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="411">The reason being that people, uh those who are um... who are um...who are uh assigned to do the cleaning would uh clean up the <span class="interior space">rooms</span> where we slept; and they themselves would then join us and go to work with us. </sentence><sentence id="412">And certain hour after, uh we would all assemble and there was a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="413">A roll call uh is the...it is a ceremony that the Germans never stopped uh doing. </sentence><sentence id="414">It was uh at certain times uh three roll calls a day; in the morning, in the uh at noon, and in the evening--and later on, too. </sentence><sentence id="415">But not less than two. </sentence><sentence id="416">And after roll call--if everything was OK, if there was nobody missing, you...you...all the dead from the night before were counted.... And they were, have to be counted because at night the <span class="building">offices</span>, <span class="building">German offices</span>, were closed. </sentence><sentence id="417">So if anybody died, you would be counted as alive until the <span class="building">offices</span> opened so he could be uh crossed out in the big book and say that he is uh...he is dead. </sentence><sentence id="418">So anyway this was...if everything accomplished, and uh and nobody, as I say, was missing, then you would join the groups, working groups. </sentence><sentence id="419">So the people would  go, you know; some would go to the uh...uh to...with the <span class="spatial object">wheel-barrows</span> and uh spades, you know, to do the work on improving the <span class="dlf">roads</span> or to the agriculture or, you know, or to the so-called "<span class="building">Bauhof</span>" [Ger: "<span class="interior space">building yard</span>"], where all the professionals were working. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="420">Uh, uh...all the skills like uh...uh masons and uh...and uh carpenters. </sentence><sentence id="421">There was a, also in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in that <span class="region">area</span>, a group of uh sculptors from <span class="populated place">Zakopane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="422">They would do this...they would, they would create the plates for SS;

of course, in...in uh <span class="building">offices</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425">I work, my first work was in uh...an <span class="building">architect's office</span>; and uh I was assigned to do the renderings, color renderings, of uh projects that were in...in uh...on the <span class="spatial object">drawing table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">Uh, all these drawings will then, will go with the plans to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> for approval. </sentence><sentence id="427">Everything has to be proved; approved in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, or in <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> or in <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="428">I also had a secondary responsibility uh...in that <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="429">I would help the surveying team. </sentence><sentence id="430">From the very beginning, uh, the surveying team would go in the <span class="env feature">terrain</span> and do a uh...work on the <span class="spatial object">map</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">And they were really hurrying; the German wanted it, that map, because the uh <span class="region">area</span> around <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was being depopulated, the vill...<span class="populated place">villages</span> destroyed, people taken to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="432">Uh so, uh that any <span class="env feature">terrain</span> would have to be measured...uh all the <span class="dlf">roads</span> and all the <span class="building">buildings</span> or everything, and sent; because on it, that basic <span class="spatial object">map</span>, they would do the planning what's going to be there in the future. </sentence><sentence id="433">On one (cough)...one <span class="region">area</span> of that uh big <span class="region">territory</span> there, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> on...later on they built a huge compound "<span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>," which is the <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Brzezinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">In Polish, it's called <span class="populated place">Brzezinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">In German, they call it "<span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>." </sentence><sentence id="436">Uh, this is where later on, in 1940, would be start the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="437">So, uh, until the evening we would do all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="438">Uh, all of this outside of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>; uh, so we would go in the extra guards. </sentence><sentence id="439">Extra guards--there are large <span class="building">garrison</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="440">Uh, they would set out some...1941, some hundred guardsmen, and they would join--few of them with every group--and go and stay the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="441">Again in the evening we would all return. </sentence><sentence id="442">And, uh...uh on the average day in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> there were always orchestra playing, and uh the people would return and form like a small parade. </sentence><sentence id="443">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="444">With the tools in the hands that they used during the work. </sentence><sentence id="445">They would march to German tangos and (laughter) and uh...military songs; and this was must. </sentence><sentence id="446">And to attention, of course, while the commandant and all the SS would watch. </sentence><sentence id="447">And you have to do, uh, march very briskly, like uh...like a soldiers; because the German, they like make of us soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="448">Uh, to a point, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="449">And then of course we would assemble on the roll call place, and there would be the roll call again. </sentence><sentence id="450">If the roll call was successful--nobody had escaped--uh, then we would go, and we would get your our uh...our uh supper. </sentence><sentence id="451">If there was a situation what somebody escaped, then instead of going to the <span class="interior space">Block</span>, we would wait. </sentence><sentence id="452">And, uh, meantime the search party would go out and search for, uh...for a man who has escaped; and the search party would be, uh, composed of the soldiers and the Kapos, uh, from there. </sentence><sentence id="453">So there would be about three hundred, four hundred people going around and looking for, uh...for an escapee. </sentence><sentence id="454">Usually it was not, uh...it was almost impossible to leave entirely the <span class="region">area</span> of the...where, where the during the day the guards were stationed; because, uh, it is always, uh, open...that <span class="region">area</span> was open...and there was no, uh, no places, no...no <span class="env feature">bushes</span>, no <span class="env feature">trees</span>, nothing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="455">So app...usually an escapee would have to know, uh, have to, uh, get the hiding somewhere in the <span class="building">building</span> in that <span class="region">area</span> outside of the  <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and then wait for a night to come. </sentence><sentence id="456">So that is why most of those who escaped, uh, usually were found. </sentence><sentence id="457">Now if a man was found, then he would go to a <span class="building">bunker</span> for a while, true uh...uh. </sentence><sentence id="458">And he would be asked </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: why he did it, how he did it. </sentence><sentence id="460">Gestapo were interested in that. </sentence><sentence id="461">And then on the next day or day after, he, uh...he would be paraded through <span class="populated place">camp</span>; and then, uh, on the, uh, roll call, uh, ceremony he would be hang on the <span class="spatial object">gallows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="462">And this was a regular punishment. </sentence><sentence id="463">If a...if this was not the case, then we would go just simply to the <span class="dlf">blocks</span> and get our soup and bread and margarine, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="464">And it was all kinds of, uh, uh...and this diet was, uh, usually a watered soup and a slice of bread, and a little bit of of margarine. </sentence><sentence id="465">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="466">And then after that, uh, there was about one hour of daylight; so in this time you would have to repair your uniform, you know. </sentence><sentence id="467">Under the supervision of Blockaltester, who was the...the manager of the <span class="building">Block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">And what is the <span class="dlf">Block</span>? </sentence><sentence id="469"><span class="dlf">Block</span> was a, uh, a number of people who lived on...in...on one <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="470"><span class="dlf">Blocks</span>, uh, <span class="building">buildings</span>, were two-story <span class="building">buildings</span>; and that means in every <span class="building">building</span>, uh, would be two <span class="dlf">blocks</span>, uh...because there were two different <span class="interior space">floors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">Sometimes even on, uh, in, uh, on <span class="interior space">attic</span> they would form another <span class="dlf">Block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="472">And generally was not more...not enough <span class="interior space">room</span> more for some hundred and fifty men. </sentence><sentence id="473">But I remember times when there were up to one thousand people in every <span class="dlf">Block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="474">So in one <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, we would sleep six of us. </sentence><sentence id="475">So there was actu...actually no sleep; we were just sitting, you know, the whole night. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: Well, we waited for a word from the outside people where, when the escape will occur. </sentence><sentence id="838">When, and what time. </sentence><sentence id="839">And uh we were given four days. </sentence><sentence id="840">We couldn't go...there was a plan for four days. </sentence><sentence id="841">Uh, we couldn't go in the first day because first day was a Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="842">The second day was a very bad weather after Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="843">So at the end, it was on 29 of December that in the morning we decided that we're going to go. </sentence><sentence id="844">And it happened this way: I went uh...<span class="populated place">Kuczbara</span> and myself, we went to the <span class="building">office</span> on usual schedule; and then went out of the <span class="building">office</span> with the papers to, into...into the <span class="region">area</span> where uh the people, usually new people, usually used to come and wait, you know, to...for, uh uh... in...interrogation, you know. </sentence><sentence id="845">That was our job. </sentence><sentence id="846">Two other people--uh Otto [Kiissel] and uh Januszewzki-- they were uh the "<span class="building">Arbeitsdienst</span>"; they had to uh send out all the <span class="spatial object">columns</span> out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="847">And then they would come to our <span class="building">office</span> and have to write a uh a report. </sentence><sentence id="848">Every morning. </sentence><sentence id="849">This I have to emphasize, how...how this uh uh the pro...procedure in, in our <span class="building">office</span> were. </sentence><sentence id="850">Every morning, they had to write a report on how the employment of the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> looks like--where, how many they were uh... there were people employed in what categories of jobs, how many there are sick, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="851">Now these reports written on a special <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span>, big one; was then be taken by a messenger--a soldier--who traveled to <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span> every day. </sentence><sentence id="852"><span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span> was a uh <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the labor, of all the labor assignments in the...in, in the...in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in the whole <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">And uh on that particular day, 29 of December, they had to do that in order to be free. </sentence><sentence id="854">After that they could do whatever they wanted because, you know, they were not [<span class="populated place">Czerk</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="855">You know, they would uh they would visit uh various uh working groups in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, or in the uh uh <span class="region">area</span> inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="856">So Otto went to that SS man, who...uh and he got from him a pair of horses and a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>; and drove this, this uh <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span> through the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, through a main <span class="dlf">gate</span>, to <span class="dlf">Block 24</span> where we all lived. </sentence><sentence id="857">And he grabbed four or five prisoners who were wandering in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and made them go into the <span class="interior space">attic</span>; and from the <span class="interior space">attic</span> they brought down four uh cabin[et]s, wooden cabin[et]s. </sentence><sentence id="858">They loaded it on the, on that <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span>--which was a <span class="dlf">platform</span>--and he drove out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> again, went to that SS man he was dealing with, gave him two cabin[et]s for...for just uh making that deal; and with two uh... two cabi...<span class="spatial object">cabinets</span> on that <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> uh he would uh ride to a place where, in between, <span class="populated place">Kuczbara</span> would dress into the uniform, SS uniform. </sentence><sentence id="859">Uh, and...and I was with him; and we were waiting for ...for those two to come. </sentence><sentence id="860">We took from our <span class="building">office</span> about  4 sixteen thousand names, files uh of people, uh of <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="861">Some <span class="spatial object">transports</span> were completely annihilated. </sentence><sentence id="862">You know, we took this as a...as a sample what is going on in our...in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="863">Also, we took a list of uh people who were executed in uh...in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>--on the <span class="dlf">Block 11</span>--with the signature of the, the top uh doctor, SS doctor. </sentence><sentence id="864">Uh, he had to countersign them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="865">So we had, you know, some twenty-four thousands of names that we took with us in our <span class="spatial object">briefcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="866">And when the Otto and Januszewzki arrived with that <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, we jumped on and we uh drove off to the main <span class="dlf">gate</span>, again. </sentence><sentence id="867">And at 11 o'clock, uh we drove through the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="868">The soldier opened the <span class="dlf">barrier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="869">Uh <span class="populated place">Kuczbara</span> told him, "Heil, Hitler!" </sentence><sentence id="870">And that's it, and this was the end.(Laughter) Because we were posing as a working group. </sentence><sentence id="871">We had a...these uh <span class="spatial object">cabinets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="872">This was supposed to mean that we are, you know, delivering a <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> to a <span class="building">SS house</span> somewhere in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="873">So nobody bothers us. ( </sentence><sentence id="874">Laughter) That's the way! </sentence><sentence id="875">And then we drove through on the <span class="dlf">road</span> around the...near the uh <span class="env feature">Sola River</span>, through <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to the <span class="populated place">village</span> of [<span class="populated place">Brzeszkowice</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="876">The <span class="populated place">village</span> [<span class="populated place">Brzeszkowice</span> (ph)] was already empty. </sentence><sentence id="877">People were already thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="878">There were still <span class="building">buildings</span>; and in those <span class="building">buildings</span> the <span class="interior space">underground</span> put in, you know, our...the, the civilian clothes for us. </sentence><sentence id="879">We changed. </sentence><sentence id="880">We...we uh...drove that uh <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span> into a...into a <span class="dlf">alley</span> under the <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="881">Horses to the...also. </sentence><sentence id="882">We take care of that. </sentence><sentence id="883">You know, all the documents were thrown to the <span class="dlf">well</span>, uh deep <span class="dlf">well</span>; and some stones thrown on the top of it. </sentence><sentence id="884">And then we went on that <span class="interior space">attic</span>, the uh dress in the civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="885">And went outside and to the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> on uh the <span class="env feature">River Vistula</span> [NB: Wis_a (Pol)]. </sentence><sentence id="886">That [<span class="populated place">Brzeszkowice</span> (ph)], this is a <span class="dlf">triangle</span> made of two ri...<span class="env feature">rivers</span>, <span class="env feature">Vistula</span> and <span class="env feature">Sola</span>. </sentence><sentence id="887">It is isolated place. </sentence><sentence id="888">This is why we chose that place. </sentence><sentence id="889">We know not many people around; and on that <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, uh Sola/<span class="dlf">Vistula bridge</span>, there were four men waiting for us who had the <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="890">Each one of them took one of us, you know; and then we had walked to the second <span class="populated place">village</span> uh <span class="populated place">Libi_z</span>, where we stayed for a week. </sentence><sentence id="891">Now the man...yeah, the man who, who was uh managing this whole uh project was a village manager of the the <span class="populated place">village</span> <span class="populated place">Libi_z</span>. </sentence><sentence id="892">And he had Germans living in his <span class="building">house</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="893">Laughter) So uh this was also a very safe place this way, because it was no suspicion that it might be some... some, uh, strange people living in that <span class="region">area</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="894">So, uh, we got contact with the, uh, <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="895">They came. </sentence><sentence id="896">They make a photographs of us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="897">They, uh, promise us to send us the, the German Ausweis, this documents; you know, personal documents. </sentence><sentence id="898">They took all the names of all those--you know, the killed people--in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and, uh, make some photographs, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="899">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="900">The next thing what we did, was that we all at night crossed the <span class="dlf">border</span> from that <span class="populated place">village</span> for the next <span class="populated place">village</span> not far from...from <span class="populated place">Libi_z</span>, to Generalgouvernement. </sentence><sentence id="901"><span class="building">Generalgouvernement</span> was a section of <span class="country">Poland</span> that German considered <span class="country">Poland</span>, but it was surrounded by the Germans and the governor was famous, uh...uh, Governor Frank. </sentence><sentence id="902">And, uh, when we, uh, crossed that <span class="dlf">border</span> at night, two of the, uh, the men immediately boarded a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="903">Two of us, you know, walked to the next <span class="populated place">village</span>; uh, and we were prepared to hiding over there. </sentence><sentence id="904">We waited for about one week, until two ladies came from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> with the documents for us. </sentence><sentence id="905">And we boarded <span class="spatial object">train</span> again from that <span class="populated place">village</span> to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>, in order to take a night <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="906">I was supposed to get a <span class="building">studio</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, a hiding...a, a place where the the people from the underground would meet, you know. </sentence><sentence id="907">An camouflage thing. </sentence><sentence id="908">And, uh, we made it all right to <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> from the place <span class="populated place">Brzeszkowice</span>; and as we were waiting in  5 <span class="spatial object">train</span>, uh, to depart, the whole <span class="spatial object">train</span> had been uh was surrounded by the <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> and the Gestapo went into the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and arrested everybody. </sentence><sentence id="909">Took everybody. </sentence><sentence id="910">Men, children, women--everybody-- including the two of us, not knowing whom they have. </sentence><sentence id="911">So, uh, uh ...when we were arrested, we...we uh decided that we're going to have to...again try to escape again; because it was only three weeks after a escape and everybody would know now, uh recognize us in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="912">And we knew that this <span class="spatial object">transport</span> will go for sure to <span class="populated place">O_wi_cim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="913">So, uh, at the, at the moment of, uh, transition from the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to the, uh, <span class="dlf">gate</span> in <span class="building">Prison Montelupich</span>," I escape again. </sentence><sentence id="914">I threw out two of the soldiers and I start running, but the...Mietek,deg I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="915">He didn't do it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="916">So because we had it planned that we will, you know, go one in, uh, one direction and another one in other direction, and sort of a ....
