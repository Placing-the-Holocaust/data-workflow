place">Salezia</span>, which is now <span class="country">Poland</span>, and which is near <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>, what used to be the <span class="populated place">German

to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and again, I didn't know the destination at that time, at one <span class="building">station</span> in, uh, I can't recall the name right now, in upper <span class="populated place">Salezia</span>, a small <span class="building">station</span>, the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were opened, and they said all men out. </sentence><sentence id="244">That was the order. </sentence><sentence id="245">All men, working men that were able to work, out. </sentence><sentence id="246">Uh, like I said, this was not arrival at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or any other <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but it was just a small <span class="building">station</span>, and uh, at that time I had to make a decision. </sentence><sentence id="247">In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was pretty strong because I had worked that summer in the <span class="env feature">French vineyards</span> to make some money. </sentence><sentence id="248">And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but uh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men. </sentence><sentence id="249">I wanted to stay with my father. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="251">Work meant able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="252">To live. </sentence><sentence id="253">And, but we didn't know what it meant for my mother and from that <span class="spatial object">transport</span> number 31, according to the, this book from the French government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors. </sentence><sentence id="254">They determined after the war. </sentence><sentence id="255">So all the women and children went straight into the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the <span class="building">German Red Cross</span>, or <span class="building">International Red Cross</span>, at and they had a listing saying that all the women and children went straight into the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, of that <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">So I assume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> which was sometimes in September 1942. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my lucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you can survive. </sentence><sentence id="259">And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put to work in <span class="building">factories</span> or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="260">But I didn't know the <span class="interior space">gas

actually did perish. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh, my father and I were sent from that place in <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> to a small <span class="populated place">camp</span>

didn't like the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="263">I'm not saying that the Germans or the Nazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the horrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were. </sentence><sentence id="264">They called, so-called people who lived in the <span

be German and some of the people didn't speak German that well. </sentence><sentence id="266">Their Polish was a lot better. </sentence><sentence id="267">And uh, the uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good. </sentence><sentence id="268">Of course, the initial experience was the roughest experience under the circumstances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Why don't you talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger <span class="populated place">camp</span>, we were in two smaller <span class="populated place">camps</span> and each <span class="populated place">camp</span> was, I don't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="321">I think in one case it was six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand. </sentence><sentence id="322">One was the camp of <span class="populated place">Lazy -L-A-Z- Y</span>, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out <span class="dlf">railways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the sites where the <span class="dlf">railways</span> had been bombed by the Russians I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="324">In those days I don't think the Americans were coming out that far. </sentence><sentence id="325">And they bombed two <span class="spatial object">transports</span>, whatever, and also building new <span class="dlf">railways</span>, which was the hardest work because people were not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death on the job or in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">And the system was at that time whenever they needed more labor, new people were coming and being fed into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">Supposed they had in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on the job. </sentence><sentence id="328">Well, they got a hundred more from a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> or from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or wherever they got them from to be sent in to fill up the <span class="dlf">void</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And uh, so we were also digging up unexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> career, uh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far away in case something exploded. </sentence><sentence id="330">And some people did get killed that way. </sentence><sentence id="331">Uh, but, uh, railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people were not strong enough to lift up the <span class="dlf">rails</span>, and uh, some people got crushed under the <span class="dlf">rails</span>, and people fell down. </sentence><sentence id="332">Our clothing was uh, uh, limited. </sentence><sentence id="333">In the wintertime we had clogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="334">In the beginning we had our own with the <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span> on it. </sentence><sentence id="335">Later on we got the blue/white-striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="336">Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper food, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases. </sentence><sentence id="337">And a lot of people committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="338">This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, is not people being killed but people committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="339">Particularly in one <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I am coming to later on which was the last <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="340">Uh, but nobody thought they were going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="341">Uh, the first <span class="populated place">camp</span>, uh, was like I said most <span class="dlf">railroad</span> and then later on we were sent to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> and I don't know if the first <span class="populated place">camp</span> was done away with, but the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> was transferred. </sentence><sentence id="342">We went to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> and uh, when we worked on construction of <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> and <span class="building">buildings</span> for the <span class="building">Batta (ph) Shoe Factory</span> which I assume was producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any non-military projects. </sentence><sentence id="343">They were all always in support of the military. </sentence><sentence id="344">So we worked near the <span class="building">Batta (ph) Shoe Factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="346">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="347"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 that I was able to speak German. </sentence><sentence id="348">I had an advantage over the other Jews who were coming from <span class="country">Poland</span>, who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh, Yiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red, uh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="349">And if you're able to speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able on the job to execute an order right away. </sentence><sentence id="350">You understand the order was given immediately. </sentence><sentence id="351">And that was very important. </sentence><sentence id="352">Some people picked it up pretty fast. </sentence><sentence id="353">Some of the other people, if they came from <span class="country">France</span>, I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the Jews from other <span class="country">countries</span>, and in the first <span class="populated place">camps</span> we were all Jews which changed later on through mix. </sentence><sentence id="354">Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got less beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we had to work in teams uh loading <span class="spatial object">lorries</span> (ph) and we were two people or four people as a team and all of them spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="355">We tried to team up that way or working that way because it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in German. </sentence><sentence id="356">And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="357">I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian. </sentence><sentence id="358">My father was very great disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped, and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="359">It wasn't like our kids are today. </sentence><sentence id="360">And, but it helped me later on, being able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and understanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way. </sentence><sentence id="361">Uh, which I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war, it is true in many cases. </sentence><sentence id="362">If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped. </sentence><sentence id="363">And in some case, uh, uh, when we were building <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> you had to read the diagram, how to, into uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired up a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh, with uh the <span class="dlf">wire</span>, the smaller <span class="dlf">wire</span>, and if you're able to read the diagram from German, your job was much easier. </sentence><sentence id="364">You didn't make any mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="365">And so on, so that helped. </sentence><sentence id="366">Anyway, the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, the second <span class="populated place">camp</span> I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh although I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew and I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at <span class="building">home</span>, but Dutch and Flemish is almost the same. </sentence><sentence id="367">And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he picked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law was also in the same <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">So we teamed up. </sentence><sentence id="369">We were about the same height, and the same age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and it is a sad experience to tell about the Dutch Jews. </sentence><sentence id="370">Because <span class="country">Holland</span> was a <span class="country">country</span> where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of butter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies. </sentence><sentence id="371">All of a sudden no food at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short, the shortest period of time, there were very few left. </sentence><sentence id="372">I don't, I think we did receive one time a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to maybe fifty or less. </sentence><sentence id="373">I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="374">Because uh, it was much harder on them, whereas the Jew from the <span class="region">East</span>, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life, where lived in a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he was able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time. </sentence><sentence id="375">In the end it was all the same. </sentence><sentence id="376">But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the <span class="region">West</span> and a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="377">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="378"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 Jew from the <span class="region">East</span> - the survival rate. </sentence><sentence id="379">Uh, a Jew from <span class="country">Poland</span> was toughened up, or a Russian Jew or whoever they had from the, the <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="380">So in that respect I think, uh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western European Jews. </sentence><sentence id="381">But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style that they had before. </sentence><sentence id="382">So I teamed up with this boy. </sentence><sentence id="383">At the time probably more so than his family, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and I must tell this story because Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in <span class="country">Holland</span> two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends. </sentence><sentence id="384">As a matter of fact we're like brothers. </sentence><sentence id="385">And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water <span class="spatial object">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch Jews and they were lined up in the <span class="dlf">camp street</span>, and they had said that they did not perform their job properly. </sentence><sentence id="387">They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews. </sentence><sentence id="388">And they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work and hosed them down - they call it hosing down. </sentence><sentence id="389">By that they took a fire hose in the middle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the people the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death. </sentence><sentence id="390">This is, this is a winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now. </sentence><sentence id="391">A <span class="region">eastern European</span> winter, with snow on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, leaving people outside all night and by morning most of them were frozen to death. </sentence><sentence id="392">And that was the end of Mike Swab's father and brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="393">So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of course still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German quite well, because first of all Dutch and German is very close and he picked it up very fast; he knew some before. </sentence><sentence id="394">Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="395">This is another story for after the war. </sentence><sentence id="396">But uh, we could not have been closer because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to survive and our main idea was to be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="397">And I said here I have somebody who's, maybe my father won't be able to make it. </sentence><sentence id="398">I knew at that time he was getting weaker but he was pretty good at that time. </sentence><sentence id="399">So I said if we're going to make it, the young people are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could almost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together. </sentence><sentence id="400">We talked about it and then said we just have to help each other the best way we can. </sentence><sentence id="401">If you find some food, you share it with me. </sentence><sentence id="402">I find some extra food, I share it with you and it has to be complete honesty and none, none of this taking away from the <span class="interior space">cabin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="403">Many times it feels people come like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized. </sentence><sentence id="404">And we're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized. </sentence><sentence id="405">We're going to remain the way we came as much as possible and we're going to get out. </sentence><sentence id="406">Never to leave that idea behind that we're not going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="407">We are going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="408">And uh, that was the singlest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot of luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things. </sentence><sentence id="409">But I think that the, think the idea that uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="410">Now, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we move from <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">camp</span> we always stick together. </sentence><sentence id="411">His number, uh that was tattooed on his arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first <span class="populated place">camps</span> but when we moved to the subcamp of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">And uh, we uh, the bond was even stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't have a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father. </sentence><sentence id="413">Although my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

</sentence><sentence id="416">And we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I had to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh, uh, on a, a <span class="dlf">construction site</span>, on a <span class="dlf">railroad site</span>, you had what these guys they call mister ,or , which is a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke German, he left a piece of bread or something. </sentence><sentence id="417">And then I would take it back and share it with my friend Mike and my father or something. </sentence><sentence id="418">But there was a little help every once in a while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at times. </sentence><sentence id="419">And uh, when we were

</sentence><sentence id="423">Uh, I came from a Jewish family which went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> on holidays, and on Sabbath evening, but not orthodox. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="542">Things I think of I want to say, not about faith, but uh about how I met my wife later on. </sentence><sentence id="543">Uh, I married a, I married a non-Jewish woman, a German, but she comes from a non*Nazi family. </sentence><sentence id="544">I, I, her uncle was the uh, president of the German Jewish Friendship Society, he was a former German professor, and he was the Senator for Cultural (ph) Education in <span class="populated place">West Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="545">Uh and, uh, so I, I knew this when I met her, and wanted to marry somebody as a friend of my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's son, who married a woman who comes from a big Nazi family, and the family didn't even want to have anything to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="546">But uh, uh, my wife wanted to become Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="547">I said for </sentence></p><p><sentence id="548"> you believe whatever you want to believe. </sentence><sentence id="549">That's the way I do. </sentence><sentence id="550">I'm not sure I believe everything that

him almighty again, because if he was almighty, he could have prevented that. </sentence><sentence id="553">So I don't believe that God is almighty. </sentence><sentence id="554">I do believe in architect of the universe, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="555">But, uh, and my children believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="556">Uh, and I, these questions I have talked extensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever they want to. </sentence><sentence id="557">They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out before, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between me and my wife before we got married. </sentence><sentence id="558">I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="559">Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when we have children, what they will be. </sentence><sentence id="560">So, I said whatever you want them to be is alright with me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way. </sentence><sentence id="561">So I decided the children would be Jewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only. </sentence><sentence id="562">In the memory of my parents, because my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children are going to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="563">If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why they're one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="564">So my wife fully agreed. </sentence><sentence id="565">And my wife, after several years, wanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="566">You'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing. </sentence><sentence id="567">And as far as the children, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all there is to know, and they can do whatever they want. </sentence><sentence id="568">And, uh, I give them that freedom, because I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came back to me after the war. </sentence><sentence id="569">Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I was in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="570">And, about faith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he had experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had experienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could still believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="571">And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="572">Anyway, that's, I mentioned religion. </sentence><sentence id="573">Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion, one or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="574">To me, I look at my parents as being godly. </sentence><sentence id="575">They were good people, they died, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them. </sentence><sentence id="576">And I can see God in other people, live people. </sentence><sentence id="577">They are good people. </sentence><sentence id="578">I see God in <span class="env feature">nature</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">So I can consider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years, I didn't believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="580">This was one year after the war. </sentence><sentence id="581">Uh, the belief to survive I talked about. </sentence><sentence id="582">O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. </sentence><sentence id="583">One was luck. </sentence><sentence id="584">Health was of utmost importance. </sentence><sentence id="585">Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="586">Because there were so many diseases. </sentence><sentence

back to the story later on more extensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine. </sentence><sentence id="592">There was no <span class="building">hospital</span>, but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even without, with little food. </sentence><sentence id="593">For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was burned and ground

of it. </sentence><sentence id="595">So from coal. </sentence><sentence id="596">So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even chewing on a piece of wood. </sentence><sentence

said the doctors were very helpful in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>, even though they weren't allowed to practice, with that advice. </sentence><sentence id="601">And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able to survive that you were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="602">Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped later on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five pounds. </sentence><sentence id="603">I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy. </sentence><sentence id="604">And that was my luck. </sentence><sentence id="605">Uh, just skin and bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American pounds. </sentence><sentence id="606">And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same. </sentence><sentence id="607">And we picked it up, about fifty pounds in six months, in three months. </sentence><sentence id="608">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="609">But uh, from the smaller <span class="populated place">camps</span> that I was talking about, we went to a larger <span class="populated place">camp</span> which was called <span class="populated

smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="612">And these <span class="populated place">subcamps</span> were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to death. </sentence><sentence id="613">That was the point in those <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">They were used for the German war effort in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="615">In this particular case, <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span> (ph) was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> that was about I think maybe a hundred kilometers from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, maybe less, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="616">And it had the largest <span class="building">German synthetic gas factory</span>, which was several miles long, wide, and everyday we went to work in this <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="617">Now, the, the <span class="building">factory</span>, the <span class="building">gasoline factory</span> was being bombed once by <span class="spatial object">American long-range bombers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I must as a side-line state something. </sentence><sentence id="619">I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers about the bombing of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, that it couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="620">It was too far. </sentence><sentence id="621">Well, we were just, I would say within fifty miles of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">And we were being bombed by <span class="spatial object">American bombers</span>, which was something happy event for us although some prisoners got killed, and in the <span class="building">factory</span>, where we did also mostly construction work. </sentence><sentence id="623">We didn't actually participate in the operation of the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">These were Germans or other foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="625">And they had also <span class="populated place">British prisoner of war camp</span> nearby. </sentence><sentence id="626">Uh, the uh, uh, we were mainly used to clean up from the bombings. </sentence><sentence id="627">We built and built new <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> where the Germans could hide. </sentence><sentence id="628">Now when the <span class="spatial object">bombers</span> came overhead, there were several bombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings. </sentence><sentence id="629">That means releasing, a hundred <span class="spatial object">planes</span> releasing all the bombs at one time for effect. </sentence><sentence id="630">And they tried to destroy the <span class="building">factory</span> in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war. </sentence><sentence id="631">Uh, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was, like I said, a <span class="populated place">work camp</span> and not a <span class="populated place">camp</span> with <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">The people, and I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to talk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> there because that was done at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">And we were there for one purpose, to work. </sentence><sentence id="634">We worked to death. </sentence><sentence id="635">The food was so so but compared to the previous <span class="populated place">camp</span> it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there. </sentence><sentence id="636">But there was uh, one meal in the morning and one meal at night. </sentence><sentence id="637">And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at the <span class="building">place of work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="638">And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day. </sentence><sentence id="639">And the facilities for hygiene were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="640">I didn't touch on that in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and the <span class="interior space">common latrines</span> and the people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one from one another. </sentence><sentence id="641">The <span class="env feature">water</span> was someplace on, the cold water. </sentence><sentence id="642">And anyway, the <span class="populated place">Blechhammer (ph) camp</span> uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept <span class="populated place">camps</span> because the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 charge. </sentence><sentence id="643">One of the prisoners was not a <span class="spatial object">copple</span> (ph) which was so bad, but he was also was a winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="644">And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="645">And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but the, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other places. </sentence><sentence id="646">Uh, we were not bothered too much while we were in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="647">We had to work. </sentence><sentence id="648">Uh, people were sometimes beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="649">It was up to the local SS who guarded us. </sentence><sentence id="650">Or even to some of the German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew that it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="651">You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick. </sentence><sentence id="652">Now at <span class="populated place">Blechhammer</span>, it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way. </sentence><sentence id="653">Ifa hundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of time, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> immediately, which wasn't very far away. </sentence><sentence id="654">So they could work people to death and then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were taken to a <span class="building">crematorium</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or not or whether they were taken care of locally. </sentence><sentence id="655">I really don't know that. </sentence><sentence id="656">But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a couple hundred more. </sentence><sentence id="657">And this was true also in the last <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">Uh, exactly the same method of replenishment. </sentence><sentence id="659">Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know exactly but uh, November or so of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="660">My father became very weak. </sentence><sentence id="661">Uh, was also like a skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. </sentence><sentence id="662">He was going to have, and uh, at that time there was unwritten

class="populated place">concentration camp</span> had very high <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">They were made from concrete slabs, and on top of the <span

out. </sentence><sentence id="666">And it was well controlled with <span class="building">guard towers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no way to escape either. </sentence><sentence id="668">There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each side. </sentence><sentence id="669">The only place where it would have been possible to escape was at the <span class="building">work site</span>. </sentence><sentence id="670">If you worked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="671">But when I worked in a separate group, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group. </sentence><sentence id="672">And our <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, plan was that if we can escape it should be in a group. </sentence><sentence id="673">Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is found out, but some of us might get through. </sentence><sentence id="674">So it always better in a group, then split up once you're outside. </sentence><sentence id="675">O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the <span class="building">factory</span>, but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what do you do when you escape. </sentence><sentence id="676">You're in the middle of <span class="country">Germany</span> or some place or <span class="dlf">Polish border</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="677">My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by the name of Sonnon (ph) in <span class="populated place">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), whose parents were friends of my parents, to get to the <span class="building">house</span> and then to survive the war in their <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="678">And I am sure they would have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to <span class="populated place">Joasenchat</span> (ph) in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="679">And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me. </sentence><sentence id="680">Either that or we go to <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="681">But he wasn't sure where he would go to in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">I was sure where I would go to in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so we decided it would be <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">But then the question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn. </sentence><sentence id="684">In other words, you looked like a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="685">And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could throw away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and looking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go. </sentence><sentence id="686">So even if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of work, in, in the <span class="building">synthetic gasoline factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">There were many chances. </sentence><sentence id="688">And some people did escape, but they were all caught. </sentence><sentence id="689">And when they were caught, they were brought back to <span class="populated place">camp</span> and hung whether they were dead or not dead. </sentence><sentence id="690">They were hung or put on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> for all the prisoners to see. </sentence><sentence id="691">Here's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="692">Some of them were shot and the bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before uh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it. </sentence><sentence id="693">They were left out all day, all night, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes. </sentence><sentence id="694">And that was standard procedure - to bring them back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and let all the prisoners see what happens to an escapee. </sentence><sentence id="695">Well, uh, I have one other incident at <span class="populated place">Blesheimer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">Uh, I got hit by machine gun fire. </sentence><sentence id="697">There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war effort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but occassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the German war effort. </sentence><sentence id="698">In other cases, where three people were hung at <span class="populated place">Blesheimer</span>; they were accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting <span class="dlf">telephone lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">But what they had done, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts. </sentence><sentence id="700">And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the <span class="dlf">wire</span> and they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> being assembled. </sentence><sentence id="701">In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an example, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution. </sentence><sentence id="702">And one of our plans that Mike and I had was also which we had learned from other people, the thing to do to get This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="703">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="704"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 out of something, if there is not a planned execution where they just make sure everybody is dead, , to drop the moment they start firing, to drop down, and let a body  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was already captured at that time or not. </sentence><sentence id="705">I have no knowledge of that. </sentence><sentence id="706">But they were getting close to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> too, and <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I don't think made any death marches. </sentence><sentence id="707">People were just left in there or killed or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="708">But in this particular <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> that we were in, or subcamp of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we were evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="709">This was the plan I assume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night time put in a <span class="dlf">field</span> with lights away from the front towards <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="710">And we finally arrived. </sentence><sentence id="711">When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days, we went for days without food. </sentence><sentence id="712"><span class="env feature">Water</span> we got once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="713">And I assume, I don't have any specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four thousand prisoners that were marched out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="714">Some people remained behind, and there were other people in other <span class="populated place">camps</span> that I read up after the war, that came to the <span class="populated place">camp.</span> </sentence><sentence id="715">They had to put them somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="716">People who had been marched into this <span class="populated place">camp</span> from other <span class="populated place">camps</span> when we were out already. </sentence><sentence id="717">They didn't know what do to with them, the Russians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures. </sentence><sentence id="718">It was very confusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of <span class="populated place">Blesheimer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="719">Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span> which was another large, larger <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="720">And in the group that I was in, we were standing in <span class="env feature">mud</span> being counted, and I was standing in the <span class="interior space">front row</span> being able to understand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior. </sentence><sentence id="721">He was delivering 276 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="722">Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four thousand. </sentence><sentence id="723">I don't know how many got there. </sentence><sentence id="724">I don't know how many were killed every day. </sentence><sentence id="725">But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE.....<span class="building">barnes</span> from farmers. </sentence><sentence id="726">Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred prisoners to a <span

run away during the night. </sentence><sentence id="729">If they had you out in the open, that meant they have lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="730">But if they could lock you up in a <span class="building">barn</span>, they just have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="731">And the prisoners were locked up. </sentence><sentence id="732">Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in <span class="building">barns</span> because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning before mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can, I can, but they were just dragging themselves on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="733">They would shoot them by the side of the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">They would just pile them up and fire into the group. </sentence><sentence id="735">The regular mass executions. </sentence><sentence id="736">They make sure nobody is left behind. </sentence><sentence id="737">They even went so far to make it easy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span> to execute people, next to <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="738">Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="739">I don't know why but it is very odd. </sentence><sentence id="740">But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span>, next to <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="741">Uh, so from <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>, the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span>, were transported in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="742">This was a few days later. </sentence><sentence id="743"><span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> was of course well inside <span

and split open. </sentence><sentence id="752">Some people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="753">But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably covered by others, and we got out of the <span

gotten any food from the time we left <span class="populated place">Gross Rosen</span> in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="755">Uh, we went into a <span

</sentence><sentence id="759">The moment the all clear was given we had our <span class="spatial object">parkas</span> full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing ourselves, or loading up with food. </sentence><sentence id="760">And many prisoners did that. </sentence><sentence id="761">Those that were caught were shot by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="762">We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going into <span class="building">German homes</span> and grabbing food. </sentence><sentence id="763">But again there was no way to escape. </sentence><sentence id="764">At that time it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="765">Where to go? </sentence><sentence id="766">Hair shorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="767">No place to go. </sentence><sentence id="768">No. </sentence><sentence id="769">And it was so easy to escape at that time. </sentence><sentence id="770">Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this bombing but the rest of us finally arrived at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="771">Being in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>, we thought this was going to be the end now. </sentence><sentence id="772">They're not going to take us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="773">Apparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to the east. </sentence><sentence id="774">The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection processes at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went through several selection processes. </sentence><sentence id="776">Some of them were more formal than others, and others were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="777">You were not strong enough anymore or you go. </sentence><sentence id="778">But this was a regular selection process, where to we didn't know at the time. </sentence><sentence id="779">Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right side, looking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak German? </sentence><sentence id="780">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="781">Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we were given shots at that time. </sentence><sentence id="782">I am coming back to that in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="783">What worried me long after the war. </sentence><sentence id="784">Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization. </sentence><sentence id="785">In many <span class="populated place">camps</span> there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people were sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other placces it was just for experimentation. </sentence><sentence id="786">And I had thought that at <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> before going to the next <span class="populated place">camp</span> of <span class="populated place">Leigenstein-Zwieberge</span> (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized. </sentence><sentence id="787">I didn't know what sterilization involved. </sentence><sentence id="788">It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year after the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been sterilized. </sentence><sentence id="789">But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I was safe on that point. </sentence><sentence id="790">But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I could find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was prevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be, at least not have a disease that kills everyone in the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="791">From <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> then we uh, from <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="805">The <span class="populated place">camp</span> had existed, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand new <span class="populated place">camp</span> so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">Uh, the march to the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> was very tedious every day, and almost no food. </sentence><sentence id="807">And again the replenishment method was five hundred people from <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="808">Uh, each time five hundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in mass graves. </sentence><sentence id="809">There was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the <span class="dlf">mass graves</span>, I was detailed to that for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the <span class="dlf">hole</span>. </sentence><sentence id="810">And today there are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount of prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to replenish. </sentence><sentence id="811">So then all of them in mass graves near the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="812">There is a <span class="dlf">site</span> - I never went back there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to come back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the <span class="region">western world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="813">And uh so the <span class="populated place">camp</span> is still in existence, a <span class="building">national monument</span>, and young soldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the <span class="populated place">camp.</span> </sentence><sentence id="814">But it is one of the worst <span class="populated place">camps</span> that existed. </sentence><sentence id="815">So the <span class="dlf">mass graves</span> are there. </sentence><sentence id="816">They have a very nice <span class="dlf">site</span>. </sentence><sentence id="817">They send me pictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the story is not complete. </sentence><sentence id="818">It is probably worse than if you actually read this. </sentence><sentence id="819">It is not the same thing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="820">You cannot picture this. </sentence><sentence id="821">You cannot picture going hungry. </sentence><sentence id="822">Sometimes | think if you tell someone what hungry is like. </sentence><sentence id="823">But in <span class="populated place">Lichtenstein</span>, the work was the killing method of people. </sentence><sentence id="824">By that I mean working in <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> without the proper protection. </sentence><sentence id="825">You had to dig, get the <span class="env feature">rocks</span> out, haul them on <span class="spatial object">lorries</span> out or carry them out. </sentence><sentence id="826">And then the blasting. </sentence><sentence id="827">They never had the prisoners far enough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they would carry the <span class="env feature">rocks</span> off. </sentence><sentence id="828">So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough away so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be safe from the blasting, so many people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="829">And those people had to be carried back at night and put into the <span class="interior space">mass graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">You know, thrown in. </sentence><sentence id="831">And I also must mention one horrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="832">At the <span class="populated place">camp</span> at <span class="populated place">Leichenstein</span>, they buried many people who were alive. </sentence><sentence id="833">People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get up, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a <span class="spatial object">pile</span> with the dead people and buried. </sentence><sentence id="834">At one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown in, a few live people were still moving. </sentence><sentence id="835">He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw <span class="env feature">earth</span> on him and the man was shot at the <span class="building">mass grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="836">That happened to <span class="populated place">Leichenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="837">And uh, there are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst <span class="populated place">camp</span> that I existed in, and was the least known <span class="populated place">camps</span> because it was a secret project. </sentence><sentence id="838">Now, when I mentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there was something known about it, something special about this <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="839">It was like a lot of rumors were circulating all the time. </sentence><sentence id="840">It was a common rumor which turned out to be true This is a verbatim transcript

place">camp</span> in case the Americans come. </sentence><sentence id="843">All prisoners have to be killed, no survivors. </sentence><sentence id="844">Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">Now, uh, while we were working in the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>, there were German engineers in there. </sentence><sentence id="846">I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing. </sentence><sentence id="847">Every once in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some of them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold. </sentence><sentence id="848">First of all, it was freezing in there. </sentence><sentence id="849">Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we started there. </sentence><sentence id="850">And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring in that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he would. </sentence><sentence id="851">And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing. </sentence><sentence id="852">So he was one of the good guys. </sentence><sentence id="853">And we were able to pick up this clothing. </sentence><sentence id="854">He left it ina certain place, we picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="855">And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm. </sentence><sentence id="856">That too, but the main reason was to be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="857">We figured this is one <span class="populated place">camp</span> we will never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last. </sentence><sentence id="858">And we say if we did well so far, we are not going to do well here because no way. </sentence><sentence id="859">And there was killing by working people to death. </sentence><sentence id="860">That was all, and beating to death. </sentence></p></dialogue>

that was against the law to commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And that man would have been much better off dying on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> where I found him, at <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And uh, so, from then on my idea was about suicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Now, if it would have been somebody close to me it would have been a different story. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Like if my friend Mike Schwab would have done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1203">But I knew that he, that just a momentary thing, it is not something he believes in. </sentence><sentence id="1204">I think a lot of people think about it for a long time before they do it. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Or they do it on short notice. </sentence><sentence id="1206">They say all of a sudden, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and <span class="populated place">Lagenstein</span> was probably the worst <span class="populated place">camp</span> and the worst memories I have. </sentence><sentence id="1208">Everything goes into the background when I think about <span class="populated place">Langenstein</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this was also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or they just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Officially, not just being hit, but being laid over what they called the <span class="spatial object">bok</span> (ph), which is like a special <span class="spatial object">chair</span> for beatings, and they would lash you. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to get out of some work, and we got special beating. </sentence><sentence id="1212">But we were strong and we were able to survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by other prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but my guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And so the prisoner didn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. </sentence><sentence id="1215">It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got fifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="1216">There was nothing to treat him with. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So this was common place. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Not only at <span class="populated place">Langenstein</span> but in other places too. </sentence><sentence id="1219">But <span class="populated place">Lagenstein</span> was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1220">So I am coming to the next and the last story I think. </sentence><sentence id="1221">My escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1320">I didn't even know I was bitten. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I thought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went after the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but only Mike and I made it. </sentence><sentence id="1322">The others went in different directions, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="1323">That was our plan, to go in different directions and some of us get through. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Either some of these people are killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later on after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1325">They knew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1326">So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them. </sentence><sentence id="1327">But Mike and I got to the <span class="env feature">river</span>, and we swam across, and then we were safe from the <span class="spatial object">SS</span>, from the dog, and the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk. </sentence><sentence id="1328">They maybe come with a local police dog and sniff us out. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And we didn't smell so good and uh, we were full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the white lice were just running around on the suit. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And anybody would have recognized somebody coming from a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1331">But anyway, the first thing we did we went to some, there were some <span class="building">farmhouse</span> nearby, and like I said it was at night and I don't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three in the morning and people would be asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So we decided we have to get off the <span class="dlf">roads</span>, off the <span class="env feature">land</span> where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it is safe, but not out in the open. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So we got to a <span class="building">farmhouse</span> and we found a <span class="dlf">window</span> next to the, where the <span class="building">stable</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Underneath the <span class="building">stable</span> there is, this was a solid build, <span class="building">brick stable</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And underneath the <span class="building">stable</span> they had a <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, and this was a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> for the foods for the animals, and also the <span class="interior space">potatoe cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1336">They store hugh amount of potatoes in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and we decided to get in through the <span class="interior space">cellar hole</span> which was from the outside, not going through the front. </sentence><sentence id="1337">When we lifted it up, I let myself down. </sentence><sentence id="1338">We didn't know what we would hit in the dark, whether it would be some <span class="env

</sentence><sentence id="1341">It smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And I guess right, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1343">I figured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below my feet I hit potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1344">But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop or whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="1345">So anyway, Michael came in and then we dug a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might open up the <span class="dlf">door</span> to the <span class="interior space">potatoe cellar</span>, we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping or something. </sentence><sentence id="1346">So we dug a <span class="dlf">hole</span> into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there was enough <span class="env feature">air</span> to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day where we were and what we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1347">So we got out the next day when everything was quiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of course were not found. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And then we went into, we got some milk to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1349">We went into the <span class="building">stable</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1350">We found some milk. </sentence><sentence id="1351">I think it was put there for the cats. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1354">We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were worried about diarrhea, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Anything raw. </sentence><sentence id="1356">But we got our first real food, and then we went our way. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in <span class="env feature">bushes</span>, but get

the <span class="dlf">fields</span> from work, we were foreign workers here, the place wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1452">Everything just what we're wearing to work - that's what we have, no more papers. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And he started looking at us and he started going like this, He saw the lice crawling around. </sentence><sentence id="1454">You know, stay away. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Then he said, mitcom, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I said oh my God, the <span class="spatial object">SS</span>, where to. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Well he said, and he seemed to be inebriated a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1458">He had just had a couple of drinks, beers probably, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1459">And the war was coming to an end, and things were pretty confusing. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And we could smell the alcohol on him, and figured well, this man is maybe not dangerous but we don't want to anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1461">What are we doing to do? </sentence><sentence id="1462">He had a pistol in his <span class="spatial object">holster</span>, and I said we can grab it and kill him but then somebody is really going to come looking for us, and maybe we can't get that far away. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Everybody be alerted or something. </sentence><sentence id="1464">So we figure, we noticed that the man was not decent, but he was scared. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And he said at the end, he made a comment to it, well he said I have to take you because there are some escaped prisoners in this are </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1466">A: And we figured I said are we going to get there. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Well, he said if you, if we can identify you, he said you can get some temporary papers because a lot of people have lost their papers because of bombings. </sentence><sentence id="1468">They came <span class="building">home</span> - no more <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1469">But I cannot let you go. </sentence><sentence id="1470">So I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I said, kill him? </sentence><sentence id="1472">You know, we had a little <span class="spatial object">sign</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1473">But we couldn't say anything, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1474">We could just look at each other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see this guy wasn't really all there. </sentence><sentence id="1475">He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to This is a verbatim transcript

try it. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Maybe we're lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1481">And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the open anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1482">If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go. </sentence><sentence id="1483">So he took us to <span class="building">city hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1484">The <span class="building">city hall</span> was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job for the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning papers. </sentence><sentence id="1485">We came in there and he had a <span class="spatial object">stove</span> burning papers. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And he said in German, or course, we couldn't

there papers in a bombing raid. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Uh, can we give them some papers? </sentence><sentence id="1490">Ah, he said, 5  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 was one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we would hear <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> coming across the <span class="dlf">field</span>, go towards the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, put our arms up. </sentence><sentence id="1491">But we figure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And we didn't want to get shot by the other <span class="region">side</span> either you know, by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So as the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> were coming across in the morning, it must have been about five o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that time - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we decided we're going to move on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> towards them. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Well, somebody noticed something moving in that one <span class="dlf">hole</span>, and they had in the meantime had <span class="dlf">holes</span> on the right, probably on both sides of where we were . </sentence><sentence id="1495">But we were far enough away not to be  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact

collection 3 <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, and my case go both to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>, and <span class="populated place">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Because either place our family could have been. </sentence><sentence id="1498">But we had decided in the case of my immediate family was in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1499">My parents that we would meet in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Or meet in <span class="populated place">Muchenglablak</span> (ph) with a Catholic family that we know. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So I went to both places. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Didn't find of course anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And I did find some distant cousins and I did make some contact with the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Committee</span>, which was of course a Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, and then the thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost 19. </sentence><sentence id="1505">No, by the time I came back I was 19 already. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Uh, they said that I am too old for an <span class="building">orphanage</span>, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1507">But the man that ran the <span class="building">Joint Distribution Organization</span> in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had been one of my father's friends in one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, in the <span class="populated place">French camps</span> of <span class="populated place">St. Cyprien</span>, and he said, well, 18 is the limit for <span class="building">orphanages</span>, but you're past limit, but we'll let you have a little <span class="interior space">room</span> in here, and you find a job. </sentence><sentence id="1508">We'll put you through <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1509">We'll do something for you. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So I got a little <span class="interior space">room</span> in the <span class="building">orphanage</span> there and I went to <span class="building">school</span>, back to <span class="building">school</span>, and tried to learn a trade at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1511">And Michael went back to <span class="country">Holland</span> at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1512">He wasn't as lucky as I was. </sentence><sentence id="1513">He didn't find, well I didn't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1514">He didn't find anyone from his family. </sentence><sentence id="1515">Everybody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And uh, he didn't have the offer to go into an <span class="building">orphanage</span> or anything up there. </sentence><sentence id="1517">So he went back to the <span class="building">Third Armored Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1518">They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use official transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to this place in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1519">We were fully covered. </sentence><sentence id="1520">So Michael took advantage of that and uh, make his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish soldier, to come to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And he stayed with him until he actually left for the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1522">I remained in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, and I also came to the <span class="country">United States</span>, but I came in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1523">I came by asking for visa to go to the <span class="country">United States</span>, and I had to wait until December "47 to get to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1524">I did get to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And the draft was still going on here. </sentence><sentence id="1526">I was going to be drafted. </sentence><sentence id="1527">In Europe, if you were in <span class="country">Germany</span> of course, but <span class="country">Germany</span> didn't have an army, but other <span class="country">countries</span>, like <span class="country">France</span>, or <span class="country">Belgium</span>, they were still drafting too after the war for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1528">I would have been subject to the draft. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Well, it would have been a bad thing after the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="1530">You know, you want to lead a regular life. </sentence><sentence id="1531">But here the <span class="country">United States</span> had nothing to do with me, that my past was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1532">I would have been subject to the draft. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they had at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career. </sentence><sentence id="1534">What I was after getting an education from the <span class="building">military</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1535">I did exactly that. </sentence><sentence id="1536">I came in as an enlisted man, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able to go to <span class="building">Officer's Candidate School</span> and became an officer and make the Army a career for twenty years. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation and I was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And then I joined the <span class="building">civil service</span> after my military career. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And I was another twenty years in the <span class="building">civil service</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1540">But I probably missed the story that is very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And I married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I wanted them to have something. </sentence><sentence id="1543">Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1544">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

id="1546">And the closest thing to me was being Jewish, and closer than that, that my parents had to die because they were Jews, the sole reason, because they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1547">And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Uh, about two months ago, I made a trip to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And I visited my, the old folks are not alive anymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who by the way were deported to <span class="populated place">Lasenstadt</span> (ph), the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and also perished, including an 80 year old grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="1550">My father, before he died, sat down with me in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> at night, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1552">Uh, he had a very good memory, and he counted out all the people, naming names, and I must have known personally maybe two-thirds of the people that he mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1553">The others were not known to me. </sentence><sentence id="1554">But they were all the Willner family - it was a close, closely-knit family who all lived in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span> of <span class="country">Germany</span>, near <span class="populated place">Cologne-Dusseldorf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1555">So the distances weren't very great, they even weren't spread out over <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1556">| think one lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but the rest of them lived in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span> and had been living there for the past four hundred years. </sentence><sentence id="1557">I even have some documentation that I got in <span class="country">Germany</span>, with the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors who first had the name of Willner and he had a Hebrew name of course too. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a German after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the families that he did his dissertation on. </sentence><sentence id="1559">And so when I visited recently, uh, I knew this before I went that in months of August and September, they inviting Jews back to the <span class="populated place">city</span> as guests of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Muchenglablak</span>, which have done some other <span class="populated place">cities</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1560">My name wasn't on the list to be there, but since I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on to some <span class="populated place">city</span> officials to tell me someone visiting early and they made a joke of it. </sentence><sentence id="1561">They got their dates wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And, uh I didn't get the dates wrong because this was a personal visit I was making to <span class="country">Germany</span> and some other <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And uh, I agreed that I would see some city officials who wanted some advance information on what a person like me who comes back to his former <span class="populated place">hometown</span> would feel like. </sentence><sentence id="1564">They had a lot of apprehension that for instance, one person in "85, an old lady, wrote them a letter and said, what is this good for, why reopen old wounds. </sentence><sentence id="1565">Why are you inviting us back here? </sentence><sentence id="1566">Well, to make a long story short, out of the people they invited, probably about 90% of the people are coming. </sentence><sentence id="1567">As the guests of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, for one week. </sentence><sentence id="1568">Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really wanted to know, particularly from one who got the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1569">In other words, they are inviting people back who escaped <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1570">They are Holocaust survivors, but they were either in <span class="country">United States</span>, in <span class="country">Great Britain</span>, in uh <span class="country">Australia</span> or some other place. </sentence><sentence id="1571">But they didn't know how many had been in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Since I had been in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and uh, also probably am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I was told, in the group that was coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1573">They wanted to know how I would feel about this, how I would feel about collective guilt, which by the way, I don't believe in collective guilt. </sentence><sentence id="1574">There are also good Germans just as well as there are bad Germans, and I am sorry to say that I've seen people in this <span class="country">country</span> ... END OF TAPE but then he said I'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you are interested in this, that you're into what happened to your family, that you went in search of your family after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1575">I have a book that recently came out that the German government put out that has about 150,000 names, 125 or 150 thousand I don't remember exactly of German Jews that perished. </sentence><sentence id="1576">Conclusion of Interview. </sentence><sentence id="1577">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1578">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1579"> </sentence></p></dialogue>
