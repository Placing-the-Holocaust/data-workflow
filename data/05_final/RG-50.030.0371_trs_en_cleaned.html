<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: He lived in the <span class="building">barn</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: He lived in <span class="populated place">Hollerath</span>, in that little <span class="populated place">village</span> until he was 12, then my grandfather, the Meyer, he was offered a job by , which was one of the largest steel producers, they made seamless steel parts, they asked him to go to <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, this is the big <span class="populated place">city</span>, to take care of the horses and carry steel parts to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> from the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">This is how then my father came to the big <span class="populated place">city</span>, okay? </sentence><sentence id="82">And he didn't even speak  German, he only spoke the dialect of his <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, and when he went to <span class="building">school</span>, they put him in the last <span class="spatial object">bench</span> where all the, generally you put the retarded ones. </sentence><sentence id="83">And he told me that when the principal came once, he asked, what is that boy doing there. </sentence><sentence id="84">Oh, he is from the <span class="region">Eifel region</span>, he is a little retarded. </sentence><sentence id="85">So to overcome the situation, he spent every minute in the <span class="building">library</span> and he came one of the most educated, self-educated man I ever met. </sentence><sentence id="86">And changed jobs and every job was an improvement, see, until he came to <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">My mother was pregnant 10 times, but lost babies and a brother of mine was born, a year and a half earlier than I and one earlier and then of course my father moved again to <span class="populated place">Kassel</span> and worked for Hensel(ph), which was at the time the largest <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> <span class="building">factory</span> in the world and he was in charge of export and took care of the linguistic aspect of exporting and so on, because he had acquired a number of languages. </sentence><sentence id="88">Already I am speaking about my father being my father, but actually maybe I should tell you that he volunteered in World War One to the <span class="building">garrison</span> in <span class="populated place">Metz</span>, which is <span class="region">Alsace-Lorraine</span> in order to learn French. </sentence><sentence id="89">And he was in World War I from the first day to the last day and was in every major battle and wounded three times. </sentence><sentence id="90">Before the war started, he came to marry my mother, and then orders came, the war had started, so he couldn't stay, but three days and then he went back and my mother was born in <span class="populated place">M-u-c-h</span>, pronounced in German , which is also in the <span class="region">Rhineland areas</span> and she was born in a <span class="populated place">resort town</span>, which became a <span class="populated place">resort town</span> and I already mentioned her father. </sentence><sentence id="91">When my mother was two years old, her mother died during childbirth, and my grandfather, not being able to cope with children, married the housekeeper of the local priest and she was the, what you read in books about stepmothers, she was a witch. </sentence><sentence id="92">I don't remember her and if I did, I would try not to remember her. </sentence><sentence id="93">So there was quite a bit of child abuse, and then when my mother was 14, she was given a -- five marks or something like that, walk 10 miles to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and buy a ticket, fourth class, that was a little above the <span class="env feature">cattle</span> and go to <span class="populated place">Cologne</span> and you were expected there and my father met, my mother then started as a maid in a rather, rather fine <span class="building">household</span> of a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I think, like my father, she was very eager to improve things, so she went to <span class="building">evening schools</span> and ended up being the secretary of a very important man in <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> and one day walking her little dachshund, she saw a rather handsome man, my father and that's how they got together and eventually ended, it ended up in marriage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: So you're describing two people who were very much self-made, certainly self-improving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Totally, totally, but the point that I am astonished when I read what my mother wrote, it's so impeccable and so well expressed that well, it must be an innate thing with her. </sentence><sentence id="114">She was a very unusual, unusual woman who didn't fit in this century at all. </sentence><sentence id="115">To her there were only flowers and beautiful things, you know she was extremely sensitive, neat. </sentence><sentence id="116">I hear my father always complaining, why don't you leave the <span class="spatial object">broom</span> away, why don't you quit cleaning, but even the handles of the <span class="spatial object">brooms</span> had to be sanded, it was ridiculous, so. </sentence><sentence id="117">But a lovely, lovely, lovely woman. </sentence><sentence id="118">I assume, probably because she didn't ever receive much love, she wondered, she went overboard with love. </sentence><sentence id="119">I remember she was 70, over 70, I'll tell you a nice thing about her, and she told me once, you know Walter, I wish I could have another baby. </sentence><sentence id="120">When she was 75, the <span class="building">newspaper</span>, the leading newspaper of <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> promoted a jogging contest, 30 kilometers, which is 18 miles. </sentence><sentence id="121">She registered and she was told, you're too  old and she protested. </sentence><sentence id="122">After her fifth victory, at the age of 81, she had a special trophy from the Secretary of the Interior, true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Could you tell us her full name, her maiden name? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Tell us what it was like to have them as parents. </sentence><sentence id="142">What was it like growing up? </sentence><sentence id="143">Did they spend a lot of time with you, giving you instruction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well my mother was a mother plus. </sentence><sentence id="148">I sometimes wonder where she got all the knowledge, because we were exposed to, that is my brother and I, we were exposed to food, which is now whole food, or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Natural food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Natural food, yeah, and I had to drink carrot juice and lots of fruits and the butter had to be special butter and the eggs had to be from <span class="dlf">yard</span>, yard eggs, yard chickens who ran free and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="154">Very little meat, and she said the fact that I survived is because she nursed me 18 months and my father was, he expected me to be the way he wanted me to be and I was exactly the opposite, so not getting any attention at <span class="building">home</span>, I tried to get attention in other ways. </sentence><sentence id="155">That led to a situation where, he would probably beat me up three times a week. </sentence><sentence id="156">It came to the point where we didn't speak to each other, there was no communication, and I was not allowed to eat at the same <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">So it was quite extreme. </sentence><sentence id="158">I think if you had given me a gun when I was 11, I probably would have shot him. </sentence><sentence id="159">It took me many years and nowadays I miss him. </sentence><sentence id="160">It took me many years to love him dearly, I hated him. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, you know, when he looked for me, he wouldn't ask for my son, he would ask for, have you seen Walter Meyer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: How did he want you to be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Follow his footsteps, to do, obey, be first in <span class="building">school</span>, just be good. </sentence><sentence id="174">He kind of admired me, didn't show it much, because I was a top athlete and even the horrible things I did, he admired me for them, but he didn't openly agree to it and things started, probably he resented me and I don't think he liked very much the fact that I was born really. </sentence><sentence id="175">Became a liability, and I wet the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> every night. </sentence><sentence id="176">Well, that meant he had to get up during the night and oh, when he came I was already wet, or after he had come I wet the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, so it started there and then I just didn't do the right things, I was late, I didn't -- whatever he expected me to do, I was the opposite of my brother, who looked like him, who did exactly what he expected of him, he was a kind of outstanding boy. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was the one who was always in trouble. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So you were rebellious at first, within the <span class="building">family structure</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Yeah, I was probably born rebellious. </sentence><sentence id="180">Yeah, within the <span class="building">family structure</span>, yes, my brother would receive chocolate and he would probably have it for three weeks, but I ate it immediately and hated him for having some left. </sentence><sentence id="181">I liked the outdoors, I should have been born in <span class="region">west Texas</span> on a big <span class="dlf">ranch</span> with animals. </sentence><sentence id="182">I was confined so. </sentence><sentence id="183">Fortunately my father, for example, he thought maybe if he embarrassed me in public by putting the <span class="spatial object">bed sheets</span> outside like flags, that would make a difference. </sentence><sentence id="184">Well that upon the teasing. </sentence><sentence id="185">Fortunately I was physically, I was in good shape, so anybody who would start teasing me, I didn't suffer much, because I would beat them up, so my physical status helped me in many ways to overcome this. </sentence><sentence id="186">But it was not a pleasant situation and it was kind of balanced with the enormous amount of love that I received from my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: It's like it sounds like almost the two you know, very, really kind of stern and sometimes brutal father and a mother " </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Yeah, except one time I was a little surprised, I was in <span class="building">school</span>, I was already 12, 13, I went to the <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">In <span class="country">Germany</span> you start <span class="building">high school</span> at 10, you don't have <span class="building">Junior High School</span> and all of the -- and we had a teacher with one wooden foot and we call him the rhino, because when he came down the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, it was like an earthquake and he liked to slap boys, there was no co-education, all boys and you generally had two answers to a question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="200">If you answered A, he would slap you, if you answered B, he would slap you. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I think I always in my life hated for somebody to touch me, except with a nice embrace or a kiss, and so I came <span class="building">home</span> and I left a note, because I didn't talk to him, I left a note with my father, told him about the situation, that I was not going to go back to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, he went, I understand, checked with others, and found out that I had told the truth, so he left me a note that said, next time he hits you, hit him back. </sentence><sentence id="203">So I told everybody in <span class="building">class</span> my father told me to hit him back, so I became an instant hero and a double hero after it was done. </sentence><sentence id="204">My God, everybody was in expect, expectation and sure enough, the next day he hit me and I hit him back and ran and ran. </sentence><sentence id="205">So there was a special conference and my father was called and I think he wanted to have the privilege of being the only one to hit me and the teacher actually was moved to another <span class="building">school</span> or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="229"> education of everything, German and Germanic, which made you believe that we were a superior race. </sentence><sentence id="230">We learned, in an intellectual way, to recognize Jews and others. </sentence><sentence id="231">Jews were then regarded as a race, rather than a religion, were inferior. </sentence><sentence id="232">It was explained very thoroughly that even statements made by and other prominent Jews who spoke negatively about their , So to speak, so there was justification. </sentence><sentence id="233">The history of the Jews as nomads and , you learned to appreciate that Jews were inferior or no good. </sentence><sentence id="234">Maybe similar to the <span class="country">United States</span> where you learn that blacks are there to shine your shoes, period. </sentence><sentence id="235">I had a little problem understanding that, because there are so many instances in my life where there are confusion, simply because I was born at a time where I played with Jewish children, I went to their <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">I loved to go to their <span class="building">houses</span> because their mothers had goodies, nice cookies and they had better toys than I had, but then, there was nothing wrong with them and suddenly they kind of became outcast and they disappeared and had David stars on their clothes and so on. </sentence><sentence id="237">That was a little confusing to me, and I became, probably because I liked the attention, I became an altar boy, and I asked the priest one day, I said, why is all this anti-Jewish sentiment and Jesus was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="238">I says it says INRI, that means Jesus was__ King of the Jews, he was a Jew and the answer then was, you are not supposed to ask these questions, and to express doubt. </sentence><sentence id="239">Doubt is not a very Christian thing to do, just accept things as they are. </sentence><sentence id="240">And he called me son and I hated him because I knew he couldn't have a son and he called me son, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="241">So one day, I was just so mad I just, see the big book that you have, I just threw it on the <span class="dlf">altar steps</span> and ran. </sentence><sentence id="242">I didn't go back there. </sentence><sentence id="243">But that was very controversial issue with me. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then of course we came to, when I was rather young, I was 12 years old, we came to . [ </sentence><sentence id="245">don't know how many times I tried to, to, to start a fire in the <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">There was a gorgeous <span class="building">building</span>, but so massively built out of, I think sandstone, that you couldn't even start a fire. </sentence><sentence id="247">So I don't know how many times they tried to burn it, and then I looked and I saw people throwing through the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">I said, why do they do this to poor people and so on, it just didn't make any sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Who was throwing the ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: The SA and SS, after a member of the <span class="building">German embassy</span> in was killed by, I understand by a Jew, the Crystal night started and they just cleaned out, and told the Jews to leave because we want to have a <span class="country">Germany</span>, a racially pure <span class="country">Germany</span> and they were asked to leave. </sentence><sentence id="273">So I remember that very vividly, it was like an uncontrolled revolution. </sentence><sentence id="274">The mob took over, and it seems whenever there are revolutions, many people look for an opportunity to do ridiculous, nasty, violent things. </sentence><sentence id="275">It seems to be part of the German element, especially those who have been oppressed for some years, all of this is a golden opportunity to just go without asking why, they just go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Think about that night and when did you realize something funny was going on, did you hear sounds, did you smell the fire, did you run out of the <span class="building">house</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: As I remember it, we used to have, well every German family was supposed to have a little <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, it was called a . </sentence><sentence id="282">The <span class="spatial object">Volkes receiver</span>, like the <span class="spatial object">Volkswagen</span>? </sentence><sentence id="283">It was the <span class="spatial object">Volkes receiver</span>, which was the standard model, if you had more money, you bought a more sophisticated one, but the allowed you to listen to the news, to Hitler and so on </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: No, I don't think we even discussed it, my mother asked questions like, asked my father, why do they do that, why are people like that? </sentence><sentence id="302">Those are the questions that I remember and my father was very short-tempered with answer, like you know people are beasts and that would be the end of that conversation, so it was not discussed widely. </sentence><sentence id="303">Discussions came a little later, after the war had started and my father would make clear that it would be impossible to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="304">He had been in World War One. </sentence><sentence id="305">Especially when the Germans marched into <span class="country">Russia</span>, he said that'll be the end, that's the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="306">He had a very important position, because of his rather impeccable knowledge of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="307">He was sent to Liedel(ph), which is in <span class="region">Northern France</span>, it's kind of the Pittsburgh of <span class="country">France</span>, under German occupation, to become the liaison man and to see that things would run smoothly and he was in charge of about 750 <span class="building">factories</span>, mostly iron and steel. </sentence><sentence id="308">So Liedel(ph) was his <span class="building">headquarters</span>, and he was one of the few who had never become a member of the National Socialist Party, because he just hated these men who suddenly appeared with brown shirts and swastikas who became functionary with the party, and in many cases people without any outstanding reputation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="309">And I remember people coming to the <span class="building">house</span>, we did not have too many visitors, but when he spoke, he really didn't care, he didn't give a damn, really. </sentence><sentence id="310">But I heard people say, Paul, or Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">Meyer, you shouldn't talk like that because you know what happens to those who talk to much, ah, he just shook it off. </sentence><sentence id="312">Anyway, he was in <span class="country">France</span> and I had a letter the other day, the French government wants to decorate him posthumously for all the things he has done for the French during his stay in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">I'm in many ways, I don't know whether I hate to recognize it, but I'm in many ways exactly like him. </sentence><sentence id="314">So that's the genetic secret. </sentence><sentence id="315">Back to your question, that is what I remember, glass, broken things everywhere, <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> being thrown out of the <span class="dlf">window</span>, to the point where it was so wild that you, you tried to stay at <span class="building">home</span>, you tried to go away, it looked a little dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: What was the mood among you and your friends or other families? </sentence><sentence id="317">Okay, that there's this horror going on outside, things are being broken and thrown, people don't really understand it, there's not a lot of discussion going on at <span class="building">home</span> about it, what was the mood? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="318">Did you know what was coming ? </sentence><sentence id="319">Did it surprise you that it happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: I think my generation, we were a little too young to understand, but you would hear those who would make remarks like, all this good stuff, just destroying it, makes no sense and you would hear others say, they asked for it, they asked for it, they had it coming, suits them well. </sentence><sentence id="321">So you had these two parties, and then others who had learned to shut up, to say nothing, and that party was probably the strongest one. </sentence><sentence id="322">They didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="323">Another party would say, they know what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="324">Don't forget the, well <span class="country">Germany</span>'s a very young country is <span class="country">Germany</span>, but let's say Germanic people, for endless generations, have obeyed government, faithfully, stupidly, without asking questions, and when you read the paper, or you just read the paper in <span class="country">Germany</span> and then this is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="325">Nobody would say ah they lie, papers don't tell the truth, this was the word. </sentence><sentence id="326">So there was no open rejection, resistance, uproar, , no. </sentence><sentence id="327">But you have to understand that by that time Jewish propaganda in newspapers, films, radio, <span class="building">schools</span>, etcetera had already come to a high point and, but this was not the first time in German history that anti-Jewish feelings had been prevalent, in the middle ages for example, so this was just one repetition, so the Jews had always been somewhat outcast, somewhat , kind of unwanted minority, so even I remembered when I went through my father's <span class="populated place">home town</span> to take care of the cows, which I liked, because I never had to brush my teeth or wash my face, so that I was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="328">I still love to go there today. </sentence><sentence id="329">I remember Jews coming up to buy cattle, or to advance money to the farmers, with the understanding they would, they would buy the _ from them the next year and so, and they looked a little different and well you wouldn't refer to them as Mr.Mason or Mr. Sauder, you'd say, did you see the Jew? </sentence><sentence id="330">I mean this was it, it was different, and I try to make analogies of like here and see that nigger? </sentence><sentence id="331">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="332">It was an identification : </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: had that and yet you were questioning as a child, you were asking the priest, why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a questionnaire, so to speak, or questioner, I like to ask questions to the point where somebody would, quit asking so many questions, I heard this all my life. </sentence><sentence id="351">It didn't make any sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="352">But that doesn't hold true for everybody else, many people don't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="353">So I go, to <span class="country">Panama</span>, I say why is it called <span class="country">Panama</span>, people, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="354">Well ask until I finally find somebody, <span class="country">Panama</span> means wealth of fish, ah, that's , SO I like to ask questions and I remember the time my argument was with the priest, why I asked, it just occurred to me that it didn't make too much sense, but it was not a common thing, to ask questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: Did you have discussions with friends of yours that were Jewish, do you remember them being concerned, or their parents? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: No, because when it came to the persecution, that was when they disappeared and there was no argument any more, as a matter of fact, you were not allowed to associate with them, they were not allowed to come to your <span class="building">store</span> to buy, they were not allowed to attend your <span class="building">schools</span>, it was suddenly a war and that was it, so you couldn't argue with them, and say what happened to you, what happened to your father and so on, you couldn't, that was it, you did not know that they were moved to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">You later on heard j which meant <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, , you heard that, but that was more or less like hearing about, if you don't behave, you're going to end up ina , you're going to end up in a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, but definitely there was nothing known about gassing people, mass executions. </sentence><sentence id="363">was a word like, oh maybe an exaggeration would be if you don't behave, you're going to go to the <span class="spatial object">electric chair</span>, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: It was used casually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: It was used casually, yes, it was used casually. </sentence><sentence id="367">Nobody knew, when I say nobody I mean the masses didn't know that there were as many, and I'm talking now about the early 40's, as many as there were, and nobody knew what happened in them, because the ones that were inside, couldn't talk, so you knew that it was bad, mass killing, no you didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Help us understand this, at one point you're going to the <span class="building">friends house</span>, that they have great bon bons, they have great toys and then there's a shift, you don't go to their <span class="building">houses</span> any more and then there's another shift and maybe these kids aren't even here any more. </sentence><sentence id="371">So how did that unfold in your life? </sentence><sentence id="372">Perhaps there's a trend. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Well, I should have explained that one of my good friends for example, his name was Winter and they had an <span class="building">office supply store</span>, and he was Jewish or half Jewish, I think he was half Jewish and it's not like all the Jews or half Jews disappeared like overnight, there was a gradual process. </sentence><sentence id="377">Don't forget some of them went to <span class="country">England</span> or to other places, others said Hitler's not going to last, so we're going to stick it out. </sentence><sentence id="378">So they didn't quite disappear, but since they were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span>, you ask me an interesting question, I don't know whether I asked myself consciously the question, where are they now, I think maybe I assumed that they went to other <span class="building">institutions</span>, maybe to <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> or something like that, So it is not as shocking as you think it was, it was kind of a gradual process and maybe I said I wonder where they are, but you kind of assumed that they went to another <span class="building">school</span> or that they, maybe a greater assumption was that they probably went to, to <span class="country">America</span>, to somewhere, but I mean it was not known that -- you see in 38 they were asked to leave, and many did. </sentence><sentence id="379">And so I think that many, I don't even know that I remember that, but I assume in 38 when that happened, I was 12 years old, that was just they're unwanted here and they're leaving, and that was about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Your friend, I don't know if you were going to tell a story about the friend? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Yeah, what surprised me, that he lasted as far as I know, throughout the war there, and we had a, I never met his parents, we had a Jewish boy, but I am talking now about 43 and he  0 played with us, his name was Brendon Brook(ph) and I discussed it when I was in <span class="country">Germany</span> with a friend of mine, he said remember Brandon Brook(ph), I said yes, whatever happened to him, I don't know, but we knew he was Jewish, I don't know what happened to his parents, but he played with us and we used to hide them, hide him. </sentence><sentence id="387">He stayed three days with me, we put him in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, then he stayed with my friend. </sentence><sentence id="388">We didn't want anything to happen to him, because we liked him, we always, he was a buddy, understand? </sentence><sentence id="389">And whatever happened to him I don't know, because I was arrested, I was gone, so whatever happened to him, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: Did your parents know you were hiding him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: I don't know because my father was, I was pretty much independent at the time because my father was in <span class="country">France</span> and my mother, she asked me questions, where you going tonight, oh you ask too many question, I'll be back soon or something like that was the answer you see, so I was pretty much I had my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> and I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="399">I lived more, more outside that in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: But there was a sense that this, your friend needed to be hidden, hidden from view? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Oh, hidden from the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="405">Oh, there was no question about it, we knew, we knew that they were picked up and sent away and assumed, not only did we, it was not so much because he was Jewish, if we had been friends with Chinese, we would have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="406">It was kind of an entire authoritarian thing. </sentence><sentence id="407">We would not allow the police to pick him up, he's a good kid, so let's hide him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: Do you have a first memory of being aware of the Nazi's in uniform, seeing the <span class="spatial object">swastika</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Yeah, I think I was maybe eight or nine years old, where I saw for the first time, brown shirts and I saw a man who was frequently drunk and would abuse his family and nobody liked him very much, he became somewhat of a lieutenant or something like that with the SA and the first remarks of my father, saying something like, we don't got the kind of pigs that they recruit, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="415">He was very negative towards them, simply because the SA and later SS, or the National Socialist Party, a party affiliation that sort of everything was Nazified, so to speak, you saw too many people who were not very qualified men, became suddenly leaders within that movement and that is what my father didn't like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: So the messages you were getting from your father were very skeptical of the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="426">But that doesn't mean that it had much influence on me, first of all I didn't agree with them and secondly I was tough enough to find out things for myself. </sentence><sentence id="427">But you must turn the  1 page a little bit and see the part that I enjoyed and that was, first I was the , the young people, 10 to 14, that was the evolution from Boy Scouts, to the Hitler youth, which was a small step, really, even the uniform looked somewhat alike and I had been in <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="country">Switzerland</span> for a year, and there was part of the Boy Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="428">So the Hitler youth was 10 to 14, because of the was 10 to 14 and the Hitler youths, the HJ, Hitler youth 14 through 18 and the same existed for , the young girls and the BDM, BDM. </sentence><sentence id="429">BDM means , the association of German girls, so you had the male and the female version, but that was like going to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, that was like having fun, that was like not having to go to <span class="building">church</span>, so that was a pleasant thing. </sentence><sentence id="430">I was a drummer in the , and you have to do a lot of marching, a lot of singing, a lot of playing. </sentence><sentence id="431">That did not have an ill effect. </sentence><sentence id="432">Hitler youth, well first of all, it was obligatory, secondly, I became pretty much a star swimmer and it used to be, to make an analogy, <span class="building">aquatic club</span> of <span class="populated place">Washington</span> competing against the aquatic group of <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="433">became , <span class="dlf">section six</span>, <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, competing with , <span class="dlf">section seven</span>, <span class="populated place">Cologne</span> and it went then from <span class="populated place">city</span> to <span class="populated place">city</span> and then terminated in the Youth Championship of the of <span class="country">Germany</span>, okay? </sentence><sentence id="434">So you swam for the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="435">The Hitler youths were then divided like the armed forces to infantry, , <span class="building">Calvary</span>, navy and as aswimmer of course hadto__ the navy and I was trained and had become an underwater demolition expert, or a frogman, okay, which was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="436">What I didn't like, maybe that would be in front of my father, it's hard to say when you become older, what made you tick and why did you do this and so on, but I was pretty much a king on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="437">If something had to be done, like stealing apples or whatever, they would call me. </sentence><sentence id="438">And I saw guys that I considered sissies and weaklings, they suddenly got a star, they became lieutenant, and I had to salute them. </sentence><sentence id="439">Well I was not about to do anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="440">That brought about the first resentment, that's how it started all. </sentence><sentence id="441">And there were others who kind of felt the same way I did, that prompted me to start a little movement, which in reality, after the war, it was called a political movement, but at the , it was nothing but a gag. </sentence><sentence id="442">Not war and not love. </sentence><sentence id="443">We were much too young to have ideological conviction. </sentence><sentence id="444">We just didn't like these crummy guys whom we didn't see as young men, but sissies and no good for nothings and so on, that they became leaders and they told us what to do and they forced us to salute them. </sentence><sentence id="445">So they brought upon this entire sentiment and it seems everything we did was negative, we enjoyed it even more. </sentence><sentence id="446">We used to put condoms on their <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>, on the little <span class="spatial object">reflector</span>. </sentence><sentence id="447">We used to deflate the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, steal the <span class="spatial object">saddle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="448">We did everything that would be, that would bring them physically and mental harm of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="449">Then I think I went a little too far, so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

rather well, and one day, it was before Easter, or, I think it was before Easter, or around Easter time, he and his family had a baking contest of some sort, I mean they cooked cookies forever and the

distributed the cookies throughout the  5 <span class="building">dormitory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="601">Of course everybody was happy with me, but I knew that somebody would sing once they asked who did, somebody would say I did it, so I told my companion, my buddy, let's get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was on the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>, so we put sheets together, it was about 10:30 in the evening, and climbed out of the <span class="dlf">window</span>, on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">And I asked him to give me a little money, he did and I said, well let's go. </sentence><sentence id="604">We put the sheets in the <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span> and then he stopped and said, I won't go, my father is going to kill me, no, no, no, so he went into the <span class="dlf">front door</span>, to wait for the director to come and I took off and I joined then with a girl I had met and that's a little story I don't know whether you want to know about it, but I met her playing hit ball, which is kind of a baseball and we had eye contact and eventually I saw a little more of her and she came to every game and I tried to sneak out and talk to her a little more. </sentence><sentence id="605">Well, I went to her <span class="building">house</span>, she had a little <span class="dlf">garden</span> and I threw a little stone at her <span class="dlf">window</span>, she came out and we went and checked into a <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="606">I wanted her to go with me, just let's go and I knew that the police would come, the police would come to every <span class="building">hotel</span> to check who was living there and so on and so we took two <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="607">And the police came to my <span class="interior space">room</span>, police, I said look, and I had told her what to say, look my cousin, we went to a party and we have to go, we have to leave early, why don't you let her sleep and so on, so they left her alone, but after that, she joined me and I took her <span class="building">home</span> in the morning, I explained to her parents we'd been to a party, there was no <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="608">Very few people had <span class="spatial object">telephones</span>. </sentence><sentence id="609">And they understood, they knew that she was a good girl. </sentence><sentence id="610">So I didn't have enough money to take the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, I thought well, since I was rather unusual I felt, well it would be a hell of a lot of fun to take a <span class="spatial object">barge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="611">I went down and convinced the captain to take me along, I did. </sentence><sentence id="612">So I went by <span class="spatial object">barge</span> down the <span class="env feature">Rhine River</span> to <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, which is most unusual, but it was quite an event and I first met with the guys, they were happy to see me again, I told them what happened and my father was in <span class="country">France</span> already, so I remember my mother looking at me and saying, why are you so different? </sentence><sentence id="613">Why don't you give us nothing but problems? </sentence><sentence id="614">But I would find a way to say, but you love me, don't you, things like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="615">What is your father going to say? </sentence><sentence id="616">Oh, you don't have to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="617">So, mailmen had disappeared, they were in the army, so we had mailwomen and I had developed a little relationship with the mailwoman, who taught me a little about sex and I told her, any mail that comes for me, give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="618">A letter came from Elsie, that was the girl I had left and I read, I said oh my God, put the letter in my pocket, the letter said, I'm pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="619">So I didn't quite know what to do, she needed help, but my father had come to <span class="populated place">town</span> that day or a day earlier and my mother thought it was time to change , So they took everything out of the <span class="spatial object">pocket</span> and there was the letter. </sentence><sentence id="620">So my father woke me up, did you sleep with the girl? </sentence><sentence id="621">Yes, sir. </sentence><sentence id="622">If you're old enough to sleep with a girl, you're old enough to become a father. </sentence><sentence id="623">And my mother, I see her go to pieces, Paul, he's not even 13, how can you say that? </sentence><sentence id="624">Well, I tried selling things, toys I had, things of value, sent to the girl, who had an abortion by some kind of <span class="interior space">alley</span> doctor and it ran into complications, my father finally intervened and , but those are the things, so it's not only like I beat somebody up, or built a fire somewhere, I mean it was just one incident after another, so I can't blame my father too much, except that with love he would have done so much more. </sentence><sentence id="625">That means, what I'm trying to tell you is that there were different environments, so I'm now going back to the <span class="building">school</span>, which I attended earlier, so something new had to be created, there was a new beginning again, you understand, and that was about the time of the Hitler youth, because the Hitler  6 youth returned. </sentence><sentence id="626">The Hitler youth, I believe in 41.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: Yeah, I was fine, yeah it was fine because there was nothing really negative. </sentence><sentence id="671">It meant you had to go to service, I think twice a week, generally on Sundays, and the, I have to tell you another thing about another <span class="building">school</span>, generally on Sundays and it was instructional and that it, you learned the Morse alphabet, or you learned the flags, in the navy, you know, a, b, c, <span class="dlf">d</span>, x and all. </sentence><sentence id="672">It was a pre-military thing, very physical education centric and then of course I wanted to swim and the only way you could swim was by being a member. </sentence><sentence id="673">Without being a member I couldn't even swim. </sentence><sentence id="674">So I was representing now, the Hitler youth of <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">Even though I belonged to a <span class="building">swim club</span>, the <span class="building">swim club</span> went into the background and I swam for the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="676">But I was in , which meant I was about 11, I think and the truth is I don't know exactly where they were , but a new kind of <span class="building">school</span> had called the <span class="building">Adolf Hitler school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="677">I hate to make that kind of analogy, but it was about as select as the <span class="building">Air Force Academy</span>, something of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="678">A one directional school, and I was chosen to go to the <span class="building">Adolf Hitler school</span>, because I had, my intelligence level was really high, physically I was in top condition and no Jewish blood for at least five generations, so I was a top candidate. </sentence><sentence id="679">That was quite an honor. </sentence><sentence id="680">But before going to the <span class="building">Adolf Hitler school</span>, I was sent, with a group of other candidates to a kind of <span class="building">pre-screening school</span>, where there were certain tests, physical and mental tests. </sentence><sentence id="681">I was there for about a week. </sentence><sentence id="682">When my father heard about that, he said forget it, it's out, you're not going to any, that kind of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">And I hated him for it. </sentence><sentence id="684">And he explained then, with a very few words, saying things like today you won't understand, one day you will thank me for it. </sentence><sentence id="685">So I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="686">But I was chosen for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: Did you ever talk to him about why he didn't want you to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: No, it was the other way around, he told me, you now understand why I resented, yes I said, I do and I appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="708">So he was in many ways very far-sighted and very, very realistic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: You disappointed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: I was very disappointed at the time. </sentence><sentence id="714">I was very disappointed at the time. </sentence><sentence id="715">I was also, there were many disappointments one after the other, when I was even younger I wanted to go to the <span class="spatial object">movies</span>, well you can't go to the <span class="spatial object">movies</span>, there's no money for a movie, it was a ridiculous waste of time. </sentence><sentence id="716">So I went to the <span class="building">grocery store</span> for a lady who gave me five cents and did something for somebody else and delivered hot bread in the morning, buns in the morning at six o'clock to make a little money so 1 could go to the <span class="building">movies</span> and have a little money to play around, I was never with that. </sentence><sentence id="717">I remember the first, well the movies that you saw in  7 <span class="country">Germany</span> at the time, we'd see a <span class="region">wild west</span> film, then definitely, what's the little child?Shirley Temple. </sentence><sentence id="718">Shirley Temple and Nelson Eddy(ph), Jeannette McDonald, things. </sentence><sentence id="719">The funny thing is, I always saw Andy Devine, remember him, the one with the funny voice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: Hmm-mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="731">I ended up doing a portrait of Andy Devine in <span class="populated place">Austin</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="732">just an incredible man, I saw as a child, I meet him now in person, only I didn't meet him. </sentence><sentence id="733">a thing, because the big event. </sentence><sentence id="734">I think I was 10 or 11, 11 maybe. </sentence><sentence id="735">I, for some reason, I could write like an adult, a weird thing, but I could. </sentence><sentence id="736">So I would make money by writing excuses for other students. </sentence><sentence id="737">My son could not attend today because he had fever, so on and so on, and they would give me one mark or something. </sentence><sentence id="738">But I was very, very good with a pencil. </sentence><sentence id="739">With my <span class="spatial object">fountain penI__</span> of my grandfather, and my teacher would not believe that I had done it. </sentence><sentence id="740">They realized that I had done it, I was sent to the <span class="building">Academy of Fine Arts</span> in <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, which is <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, <span class="populated place">Milan</span>, <span class="populated place">Florence</span> and there are a few <span class="building">academies</span> with big names, and I was there, I went there for a period of time, maybe three months. </sentence><sentence id="741">All these weird, weird professors and teachers, I don't know, a strange <span class="env feature">environment</span>, kind of hippyish and nude models. </sentence><sentence id="742">But I learned quite a bit, so this was another kind of filler in my life, to be exposed to all that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="756">Q: you describe you father, he basically, is this a fair assessment, he was anti- Nazi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="758">A: Yeah, he was very, very anti-Nazi, very much in favor of the underdog, very much in favor of the sufferer. </sentence><sentence id="759">My father would pick up people on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, you hungry? </sentence><sentence id="760">Come on. </sentence><sentence id="761">He was like this. </sentence><sentence id="762">And my mother would say, how can you ask total strangers to come to my house?Shut up, feed him. </sentence><sentence id="763">And the guy would be someone educated, say, no I have enough, no you don't have enough, eat another <span class="spatial object">plate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="764">This is how my father was. </sentence><sentence id="765">So there was a golden heart, within a concrete shell. </sentence><sentence id="766">He was a very good man, and well _ later, when he saw me again, when I came back. </sentence><sentence id="767">Anyway, so, yeah, he was very, very anti-Nazi, anti-authoritarian. </sentence><sentence id="768">He was, in many ways like me, or I am in many ways like him, except that we didn't understand each other, because I was too much of a, I don't know, if you got into a psychological analysis, maybe he envied me. </sentence><sentence id="769">Maybe he wanted to be like me, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: Did you feel any conflict, being a part of the Hitler youth, at first, when you first were a part of it, you were embracing it when you were real young. </sentence><sentence id="784">Did your father say don't go there, don't do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: No, no he didn't, he didn't do that because the Hitler youth was really not an aggressive anti- anything thing, was a youth movement in which certainly there was a certain amount of indoctrination, but that part of indoctrination you had in every <span class="building">school</span>, you had all over, similar to other <span class="country">countries</span>, so that there, that did not mean much, besides, I have to emphasize that my father spent very little time, he was already in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="788">Of course, he went to <span class="country">Belgium</span>  8 when he was in <span class="country">France</span>, so the greatest part of the war, he was not at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: He didn't really know exactly what you were doing ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="793">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: Tell us a bit about the indoctrination, what did it mean when you were required to join the Hitler youth? </sentence><sentence id="796">On your birthday did you have to go down and register and then you were expected to make at these meetings? </sentence><sentence id="797">Did they give you a uniform, what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: The uniform you had to buy, also those who didn't have the money were given the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="802">Since everything is known pretty much like nowadays in the <span class="country">United States</span>, about you, somebody knew, somebody knew about your birthday , so then you were asked to come, the Hitler youth was divided into, let's say the <span class="building">Northwest Headquarters</span>, the <span class="building">East headquarters</span>, <span class="building">south headquarters</span>, so each <span class="populated place">district</span> of <span class="populated place">town</span> had a little <span class="building">headquarter</span> and you would then report to your <span class="populated place">district</span>, okay? </sentence><sentence id="803">And then you would be to be at what time, and when the service would be and when he would come. </sentence><sentence id="804">You would march, you would learn songs, you would go <span class="building">camping</span> and you would participate in social things like going through the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, cashing money for the winter aid program. </sentence><sentence id="805">That means those who were a little cold, in <span class="region">northeastern Germany</span>, they helped them with clothing and 5 you would have a little <span class="spatial object">box</span> and cash money. </sentence><sentence id="806">You would help, on some comers they had what they called the , where they made soup for something like a nickel, you would get a bowl of soup, good soup, good soup and you would help there by firing the <span class="spatial object">cannon</span>, or by cashing the money or something like that, you would help to collect raw material that was used for the war effort. </sentence><sentence id="807">Steel, aluminum, things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="808">Then you would go through the service to learn the specialty of your particular <span class="region">section</span>, like in the Navy, you would learn one thing, <span class="spatial object">artillery</span>, you would learn another thing, <span class="spatial object">aviation</span>, you would learn, so in that sense it was a pre-military organization, okay? </sentence><sentence id="809">They wanted you to be in superb conditions once you reached 17 or 18. </sentence><sentence id="810">When I was 17, right offhand I think three or four weeks after I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="811">Four weeks, three weeks before I had written a letter, forging my father's language, signature, asking for admittance to the navy in <span class="populated place">Wilhelmshaven</span>, which was the <span class="building">headquarters</span> and three weeks or four weeks after I was arrested, orders came for me to go, of course then it was too late, otherwise I would have joined the navy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="823">Q: So you, as a young man say, 13, 14, 15, you were beginning to see yourself fighting in the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="825">A: No question of it, no question of it. </sentence><sentence id="826">And really with some enthusiasm, because if meant adventures, it meant seeing things, it meant growing up fast, it meant proving that you were a hero, it meant all kinds of things that were appealing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="829">Q: Which some of your stories already show, I mean, you liked adventure, you were an adventurer. </sentence><sentence id="830"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: Oh, right. </sentence><sentence id="834">The greater the danger, the more I was for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="837">Q: Did you, what other sense did you have about the purpose of the war? </sentence><sentence id="838">How did you make sense of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="841">A: I don't believe that at that time I asked that question. </sentence><sentence id="842">I know what I read and heard eight hours a day, left some sort of explanation within me, <span class="country">Germany</span> was not the aggressor, <span class="country">Germany</span> was the victim. </sentence><sentence id="843">The Poles had killed a number of poor Germans. </sentence><sentence id="844">Took me a long time to read the true story, but this is what I was exposed to, the Germans than retaliated, so there was a justification. </sentence><sentence id="845">Then you learn about, we going a little ahead, but as I remember it, you see one victory after the other, no problem going through, taking <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, no problem <span class="country">Austria</span>, everybody in <span class="country">Austria</span> said Hitler, they were the happiest people in the world to be, to come <span class="building">home</span>, they called <span class="building">home</span> to the , being to reenter and so no opposition at all, you would roar. </sentence><sentence id="846">I think once in awhile I said how horrible it must be to be bombed or torpedoed and then die. </sentence><sentence id="847">Yeah, I thought, and my mother frequently said, those poor mothers when they receive notice, but then there would be a voice from someone, my father, so and so, well, that's war, that's war. </sentence><sentence id="848">You kind of got used to it, and then it didn't take very long really before you were bombed. </sentence><sentence id="849">Kind of every night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="860">Q: How old were you when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="862">A: 15. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="864">Q: What was the first one like, the first experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: You were, oh I remember my mother, probably I was 10 years old when my mother was trained against gas attacks to wear a mask and all this, so in retrospect, it's rather interesting to realize that that happened that early already, but you didn't see it as a threat of war, you saw it more or less as a good exercise to be prepared if ever, you understand? </sentence><sentence id="867">I remember how I laughed as a kid when I saw her with the mask. </sentence><sentence id="868">It was kind of a brutal thing to look at. </sentence><sentence id="869">Well, you heard, as I told you before, over radio, newspaper and so on, that attacks were expected, aerial attacks had taken place and of course always would be the enemy had no respect for <span class="building">hospitals</span> or <span class="building">schools</span> or anything, they would gladly bomb, therefore you had to be prepared. </sentence><sentence id="870"><span class="building">Bunkers</span> had been built, either above ground of solid concrete, or below <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and the siren, when the siren up and down, that meant they're coming, one tone meant they've gone, then you could get out of the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, see? </sentence><sentence id="871">So you kind of prepared that and well the first attacks, maybe they were a little bit too far from you, so you didn't worry too much, but by 19, by the end of 42, the beginning of 43, a great part of <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> was pretty bombed and of course eventually was bombed about 75% of <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> was destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="878">Q: ? </sentence><sentence id="879"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="880">A: No, not every, we lived in the did not suffer much, when you say the did not suffer much, I mean you saw destruction maybe a mile from here, okay, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="882"> and all suffered a little bit but speak about total destruction or just some shrapnels, of course <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span> not only suffered air attack, but also the Americans eventually came across the <span class="env feature">Rhine River</span> so that you had artillery, so you had from both sides. </sentence><sentence id="883">Anyway, so you, you get used to it and see suddenly a bunch of <span class="building">houses</span> that look like being under construction, but they were destroyed, you see only some <span class="dlf">walls</span> standing and you hear cruel things like one family decided not to go in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> and they were found in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> on the next <span class="dlf">block</span>, you feel these tremendous deprivations and so you then develop, oh a small minority will say we asked for it, the majority will say, will display a tremendous amount of anger, would say oh, let's help to kill the enemy, so there are very few people, in reality who said, well really, we begun it. </sentence><sentence id="884">We kind of, it was felt that we were right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="888">Q: Did you? </sentence><sentence id="889">How did you feel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="892">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="893">I don't, I don't really know and I don't really, I don't think that any of my comrades, my friends, we discussed it. </sentence><sentence id="894">I believe strongly that we considered this a temporary situation, after all, <span class="country">Germany</span> would win, therefore we didn't take it very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="895">Well, they throw a few bombs, but we're going to get them eventually. </sentence><sentence id="896">I don't remember there's, as a intelligent conversation, but I believe that was the thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: You're talking about that you would go to the service, was it actually when you were with the Hitler youth, was there some sort of ceremony once a week, you mentioned singing songs, what was the songs about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="904">A: Oh, the songs were typical marching songs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="905">The words were very nationalistic, you know. </sentence><sentence id="906">Tomorrow we have <span class="country">Germany</span>, today we have <span class="country">Germany</span>, tomorrow the whole world, things of that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="907">It was a place on the <span class="env feature">Rhine River</span> where we had all the tools of instruction, the flags and the Morse alphabet and the pictures and so on. </sentence><sentence id="908">It was a very nice place, right on the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="909">It was very far from my <span class="populated place">town</span>, so I had to go a long way, and the truth is I didn't go there very often simply because swimming meets, championships were generally on the weekends, so every Sunday I was in <span class="populated place">Krefeld</span>, in <span class="populated place">Essen</span>, and every <span class="populated place">German city</span> and finally went to <span class="populated place">Stuttgart</span> or for the German youth championship, so I was gone away. </sentence><sentence id="910">But during the week I was <span class="building">home</span> and on the weekends, we generally had a meet. </sentence><sentence id="911">So in the beginning, before I swam competitively, I went through the service a few times, but it was not that I went there for three years in a row. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="920">Q: It wasn't a really big, big part of your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: So it wasn't per se that you were anti Hitler, or anti what was going on with the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1182">A: I was much too young to understand that, however, after the war, there were a few members of course who were in my group, they were kind of glorified as the ones who resisted Hitler, but . </sentence><sentence id="1183">That's a wild story. </sentence><sentence id="1184">No, it wasn't that, but it was interpreted as such. </sentence><sentence id="1185">I mean if | wanted to glorify my life, I would probably say at a very tender age, I resisted and fought against Hitler, but that would be a lie, so I was nothing but, as I told you before, it's like a gang, and like gangs fear, kind of resent other gangs and resent the police and resent authority, that's what I did, I resented authority, because to me, authority was negative. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: Well what , because some of the things you were doing were, in a positive way, part of Hitler's plan for young people, the swimming, maybe going to a special <span class="building">academy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1191">You wanted to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A: I think I should, I should say to you with all sincerity that there's nothing normal about my family. </sentence><sentence id="1222">My father a very unusual man in every sense of the word, who spent little time with me when I was a child because he didn't particularly care for me and when I was a youngster he was away. </sentence><sentence id="1223">My mother didn't fit in the picture, she was probably the most naive woman of the 20th century. </sentence><sentence id="1224">So we were quite unusual, and as my father was a self-made man, I definitely was self-made. </sentence><sentence id="1225">Even though I had a relatively good education, but life taught me much more and my traveling around the world, much more than my education in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I was well prepared, like every <span class="building">high school</span>, like every <span class="building">high school</span> boy. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So it was my free spirit, my resentment of authority, resenting anybody who told me you have to, which prompt me to say why and that got me in trouble automatically. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I sometimes ask teachers why and that was almost like a sin, you were not supposed to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So I was the one who asked and looked for explanations for all kinds of things, but that does not mean that at the tender age of 14 or 15, I wanted to have a, if there is such a thing, a logical explanation to the existence of Hitler, or to the Jewish question, so no, that's, I would have been a genius. </sentence><sentence id="1229">That just would have been somewhat unnatural. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Would I ask, which I didn't understand why suddenly there was so much anti-Jewish feeling, then the explanation came, well because they have nothing to do but this and that, so they have taken over the <span class="building">university</span>, they have taken over education, they are parasites, they are, they have white German girls, they have done this and this and that, and whether you believe all of that or not, but they're, it creates certain doubts, are they really bad? </sentence><sentence id="1231">And as you grew up in this atmosphere, you don't ask questions like is that really all true? </sentence><sentence id="1232">No, you accept it and it does not become a dispute within you as far as rationality is concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1245">Q: , was there some other group like yours in the <span class="populated place">city</span> or in the <span class="country">country</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1247">A: Well in the <span class="country">country</span>, yes, I understand, I don't know this is true, but I think the Edelweiss Pirates, they began and some of the older ones actually had ideological ideas. </sentence><sentence id="1248">This is probably why some of the guys who met with me were later kind of glorified. </sentence><sentence id="1249">So they were <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was some of the cradle of things. </sentence><sentence id="1250">But why do you join an, why do you join a gang? </sentence><sentence id="1251">Because you're bored, because you don't like what goes on, in terms of some weirdos becoming lieutenants and captains and so on, and you want to have a little fun. </sentence><sentence id="1252">You get the attention that you don't get at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1253">That combination makes you do certain things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1262">Q: So you had, on one level, you were this perfect specimen, as you said, healthy, incredibly strong , perfect German , everything to be a perfect Nazi, on the other hand, you have this questioning spirit, so you didn't quite fit in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1264">A: That is correct and that's why I had to suffer. </sentence><sentence id="1265">You see, I have to tell myself now, that if I had behaved the way I was expected to behave, that I would have been killed in the navy, or I would have become an outstanding officer, and there's no question about that. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Of course that is all hypothetical, we don't know about that. </sentence><sentence id="1267">But even in the <span class="building">navy</span> I would have had  7 problems, because I would have questioned the authority of my superior, unless he had treated me properly, in a justifiable way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

object">lamp</span>, but just as I swallowed them, they came out the other end. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Then I found some rusty nails. </sentence><sentence id="1307">It was rather difficult to swallow them, but I did. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And they came out without destroying any of my <span class="interior space">interior</span> and finally I took a piece of the ceramic pot, from the <span class="dlf">edge</span>, it was like a . </sentence><sentence id="1309">That didn't do any harm either. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I forgot, as part of the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, I had a little <span class="spatial object">stool</span> and that was probably the most difficult thing I ever did in my life in terms of concentration. </sentence><sentence id="1311">I was going to fall on my head and just pass out, because I couldn't stand it any more. </sentence><sentence id="1312">But every time I fell down, a kind of self-preservation, I put my hands up, until eventually, click. </sentence><sentence id="1313">I don't know how long I had passed out, but I had blood all over my face. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And life went on and nobody knew that it ever had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Then I said okay, I'm not going to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1316">So I did not eat, I only drank water for 12 days and after 12 days, well we had, we had walking outside on the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, you know, five meter distance between each prisoner, walk around. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I fell, I passed out. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Well rather than take me to the <span class="building">nursery</span> or something, I was whipped half to death because it was evident that I had not  8 eaten, that I purposely wanted to get sick, that was a no no. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So then I kind of gave up and said, well it won't work I have to wait for better opportunities. </sentence><sentence id="1320">On April the 12th, April the 12th, 1943, I was taken to <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1321">My trial, the state attorney I think they call it here, district attorney, state attorney, asked for the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="1322">My thought is, first time I saw my father and my mother, my mother couldn't control herself, so she was crying, and my father didn't quite know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1323">There were two attorneys, when he recommended the death penalty, I know they kind of jumped over and hugged my arm and said, that's not the last word. </sentence><sentence id="1324">Then kind of the judge and the state attorney and somebody else, some functionary, they kind of argued about whether it was looting, or whether it was theft. </sentence><sentence id="1325">The idea was that the two had different consequences. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And so they retired and when we came back, the judge decided, or had decided that it was, well before they'd had an argument and the state attorney that, I would call it theft, but this man, having had intimate contact with our enemy, and being the leader of the <span class="env feature">Edelweiss</span> , having destroyed state goods, and state property, does not deserve any kind of consideration. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So when the judge came back and said, on the grounds of his outstanding involvement in athletism, and considering age and circumstances, I condemn you to one to four years in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Let me explain, they said, with good conduct after one year, you may be relieved and join the armed forces, and if not, you will remain. </sentence><sentence id="1329">That was it, and maybe a week later I was put in, what in <span class="building">prison</span> slang is called, I was put on <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1330">So I was taken to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and at that time, I don't know how it is today, at that time, if you go let's say from <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to <span class="region">California</span>, you would not go non-stop, you would maybe go from <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to maybe <span class="region">North Carolina</span> and stay there a couple of days, three days in a <span class="building">prison</span> and then join other prisoners and form another group that goes and you eventually come to <span class="region">California</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1331">So, first I went to <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>, the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And there I was exposed to, it was a dirty <span class="building">prison</span>, to bedbugs and lice and fleas and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And we all were set to move in the afternoon, all of us, the one side of the <span class="building">prison</span> had to move to the other side, because we could look into the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> and they used to chop heads, so they had executions in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, if you hear ding, ding, the little <span class="spatial object">bell</span>, so we weren't allowed to witness that, so we had to go the other side. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1379">Q: Who would it be? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1381">A: Well, whoever was condemned to death, but instead of <span class="spatial object">electric chair</span> they had beheading, which is really not an axe like so many people believe, but is an extremely sharp instrument that just go kind of straight through. </sentence><sentence id="1382">So, from <span class="populated place">Cologne</span>, I went to , that took two or three days. </sentence><sentence id="1383">From there to <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> I was accompanied to where a few of the group, was a kind of <span class="building">security prison</span> for harsh criminals, I was condemned to one to three years in , which was a <span class="building">youth place</span>, or <span class="building">juvenile institution</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1384">So left the <span class="spatial object">handcuffs</span>, harsh criminals and then I had one guard who went with me. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I went and I looked at him for a few 1 said this is my chance, but he could read me, he said, don't do anything foolish. </sentence><sentence id="1386">It's not that bad, this is better than being on the <span class="region">Russian front</span>, so just behave and you'll get out. </sentence><sentence id="1387">So, I was always receptive to a kind word. </sentence><sentence id="1388">So I said I'm not going to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1389">I think he said something like, you don't want me to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="1390">So he took me to the <span class="building">prison</span>, which is not too far from <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> and it sounds a little funny when I say it's a beautiful  <span class="building">9 prison</span>, but it actually is. </sentence><sentence id="1391">The front part, the <span class="building">administration building</span> was once a <span class="building">convent</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1392">It had <span class="dlf">walls</span> about three feet wide. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And then from there you go this never-ending walk and then comes the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Of course most <span class="building">prisons</span> are, there's a <span class="spatial object">cross</span> or there's a star so that from the center you can see all over. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And well, like in most <span class="building">prisons</span> you receive your uniform and then you are to go to a <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and we had, three times a week we had <span class="building">school</span>, which was limited pretty much to German history and geography, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1396">It was very limited to the new <span class="country">Germany</span>, so we talk about nation. </sentence><sentence id="1397">There was more indoctrination there than anywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And I assumed that they found out that I was probably at the intelligence level, more educated than any of the others, so I got a job as assistant to the buyer. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We bought groceries and sent to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> was underway, it was a separate <span class="building">building</span> on the way from the <span class="building">administration building</span> to the <span class="building">prison</span> proper. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And I assure you that if I had been a good boy, I would have laughed at the war, I probably would have gained 100 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And the old guard, you know to me at the time, anything that was over 50 was pretty old, like my grandfather was an antique, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And anyway, he was so kind, so good, that I, I was not about to escape from him, because life was a little too good. </sentence><sentence id="1403">But in one day, I had to do, I don't remember what, I had to do something, and the old <span class="building">convent building</span> on one side and I remember, and I discovered in one of the <span class="dlf">windows</span>, there were three bars. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Thick. </sentence><sentence id="1405">You know, octagonal, they have eight <span class="dlf">corners</span> or six comers, whatever, these <span class="dlf">bars</span>, and one was loose. </sentence><sentence id="1406">That was just too much temptation. </sentence><sentence id="1407">My father was coming to visit and I wrote a little note. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I will be at such and such a time at that <span class="dlf">window</span>, please pick me up and I thought he's going to take me in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> to <span class="country">France</span> and I'm going to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="1409">I put it in my <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1410">I think I needed a key or something and the note fell out of my pocket and the guard saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I never got to see my father. </sentence><sentence id="1412">I was taken to the warden, whom I called the spider because he looked like a spider. </sentence><sentence id="1413">This immense <span class="interior space">room</span> and I had to enter a <span class="dlf">circle</span>, stand there. </sentence><sentence id="1414">He had a big nose and his gold rimmed glasses sitting on his nose, said, well, well, mistake, mistake, mistake. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I thought you were kind of a prisoner sample, an inspiration, and I thought this is probably one I will release soon, but I don't think you appreciate the treatment we gave you, so I have no choice, take him away. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Four weeks in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1417">That means, actually 28 days. </sentence><sentence id="1418">28 days in a <span class="interior space">cell</span> without light, without a <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, 200 grams of bread, that makes two slices of bread a day and water. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And that was a little too much. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I don't know if it was then, no it was the next time. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Anyway, 28 went by and one day a guard brought me bread and hit me in the face and I never knew why. </sentence><sentence id="1422">You have so much time to think and you become so desperate, you want to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1423">When they released me the guard said, okay, took a <span class="spatial object">shower</span>, I said, oh God, I want a hot <span class="spatial object">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1424">He turned the cold water on, thought I was going to die. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Oh. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And of course he hears those remarks, and it'll bring senses back to you. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Back to the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And then nobody treats you as if you have been on a very special diet for four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Life goes on, you have to work, and when you exercise, everybody starts picking on you then, because you are an outcast. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Okay, 50 pushups. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Count. </sentence><sentence id="1432">You reach 30. </sentence><sentence id="1433">But you made a mistake, start again. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Then finally you just fall down and, get up, you're kicked and kicked again, until finally you try again. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Well, that went on for awhile, seemed like I had lost a considerable amount of weight, I said I just can't, I can't, I can't. </sentence><sentence id="1436">So from where I walked I could see that there was a <span class="dlf">pole</span> to pull up the cable over the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1437">It was a little foggy, kind of bad weather, I tried to stay behind, everybody went in and I ran, and up the <span class="dlf">pole</span>, there were two cables and I ran. </sentence><sentence id="1438">One of  0 guards saw me and shot me in the leg, so I fell. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Back to the spider. </sentence><sentence id="1440">So you have this dialog. </sentence><sentence id="1441">I have prisoners who make my life difficult, I like to have a peaceful existence. </sentence><sentence id="1442">I don't know why you're that way, but I think that the only way for you is to go back to the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, it'll do you some good. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Something of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So I went back. </sentence><sentence id="1445">Another 28 days. </sentence><sentence id="1446">By that time I thought, I picked flies, I picked anything and put it in the <span class="dlf">wound</span>, so it would become infected. </sentence><sentence id="1447">I was too damn healthy for that, | mean my immune system was too damn strong for any bug. </sentence><sentence id="1448">But for a long time it stayed open. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1519">Q: Why did you put that bug in the wound? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1521">A: I thought I would have an infection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1523">Q: And you the <span class="building">bunker</span> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1525">A: Cause an infection, dirty ; </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1527">Q: Cause an infection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Cause an infection, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1530">That would take me to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1533">Q: So you kind of did it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1535">A: That didn't work, so I tried to find anything sharp and I tried to commit suicide, well I couldn't, I have scars here, all over when I look now. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Couldn't get the <span class="dlf">vein</span>, just a little blood, so that didn't do any good. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Well and life goes on and 20 days go past, back to the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1538">This time a guard opened the, he ran the hot water. </sentence><sentence id="1539">You have no idea how much I loved the man. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And I think he was responsible for getting me a job to peel potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And I remember maybe the first or second or third day. </sentence><sentence id="1542">These are cooked potatoes, I cooked a bunch of potato peels and ate them because I was so hungry, and got so sick. </sentence><sentence id="1543">Well, we were given an atlas from the <span class="building">school</span> situation, every prisoner had an atlas, but each map had a back page which was blank. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And I don't know where I got a pencil, but I had a pencil, maybe I was given a pencil, and I did a drawing, a satire drawing of the warden. </sentence><sentence id="1545">Drew him as a spider. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Even an idiot would have recognized him. </sentence><sentence id="1547">And then I drew two or three guards. </sentence><sentence id="1548">That was discovered. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Back to the warden for a third time. </sentence><sentence id="1550">I'm back in the <span class="dlf">ring</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Well at one time, at one time, I think the second time I was taken to the little , which means the little , not <span class="building">hospital</span>, but a little <span class="building">doctor's office</span> kind of, where a nurse was, and I remember she told me, don't touch it. </sentence><sentence id="1552">She put some gauze around it. </sentence><sentence id="1553">Anyway, the spider then accused me of having destroyed <span class="dlf">state property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Nobody can use this <span class="spatial object">atlas</span> any longer. </sentence><sentence id="1555">I wanted so badly to kill him, so badly, and I could hardly stay in the <span class="dlf">circle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1556">I wanted to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Well, they take me away for the third 28 days. </sentence><sentence id="1558">By that time, I was in bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="1559">But then many times when you, something happens and you see the warden, you join the others for your morning walk, they go, what happened, what happened, but you don't walk together, you walk one behind the other and well I had been called, this was the fourth time before the warden, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And he told me that on the basis of his experience with me, he felt that the best thing would be for  1 me to join the armed forces, because there was nobody else who could handle me. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And whether he told me or I knew this would be the <span class="populated place">penal division</span>, I would be first <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1562">So when I walked with the guys, I said, well I said something like, he's trying to make me cannon food, and they all wanted to become soldiers badly, everybody wanted to get out, so he kind of reported what I had said, and I was called. </sentence><sentence id="1563">Did you say you don't want to become cannon food, or you refuse to join the armed forces, I think that's what . </sentence><sentence id="1564">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1565">Three, four, five days later, I was told to get ready, I was being transferred. </sentence><sentence id="1566">Where I am going? </sentence><sentence id="1567"><span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1568"><span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> was known as a , aS a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, and that was, that was bad news. </sentence><sentence id="1569">But you have to understand that was, I was not in condition to discuss, to appreciate, to fear. </sentence><sentence id="1570">I think it was more of some relief to get out somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1571">So I packed and I went on <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, and thankfully I met several other prisoners, and we took the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, _ <span class="building">station</span>, there was several <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, we were given some soup in aluminum bowls and water and bread, and there was, well I talked to one prisoner, we talked and thenIslept__, I was pretty weak and there was one who was Jewish and I tried to get away from a conversation, said oh, what are you, I'm Jewish also. </sentence><sentence id="1572">I said, oh, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1573">That was more or less the end, and I asked him what is the other guy doing, he looked funny. </sentence><sentence id="1574">He's homosexual. </sentence><sentence id="1575">Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1617">Q: You said that you were a Jew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1619">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Just because I didn't want a lengthy conversation, I said if] tell him I'm Jewish, he's going to leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="1621">So I went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I had to change a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and there were only five of us, and one was kind of, well we ended up being three only, eventually, and one, one prisoners made kind of serious , do you remember Einstein? </sentence><sentence id="1622">We were like the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost and we will all die and things like that and oh, quit this bullshit, we will live. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Got to <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> and stayed there overnight, so I never went to the <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen camp</span>, I went to a <span class="building">barrack</span>, and somebody told me that I was going to, up ina youth , and whether there was confusion, whether there was misunderstanding, I do not know, but in 1941, <span class="populated place">Ravensbruck</span> became the most notorious <span class="populated place">women's camp</span>, where they committed all these atrocities, these medical experiments and so on and when people hear that I was in <span class="populated place">Ravensbruck</span> they say but you're not a woman, well in 1941, a <span class="spatial object">satellite</span> <span class="populated place">man's camp</span>, <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span>, a satellite <span class="populated place">man's camp</span>, <span class="populated place">Ravensbruck</span> for men was installed, installed in 41. </sentence><sentence id="1624">It had I think, all together a little over 20,000 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1625">Anyway the next day I think I went to the, with the , we were three, and taken from <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> to , that is really a short distance, then from you can walk, <span class="populated place">Ravenbruck</span> is next <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1626">And I didn't quite understand why they didn't make us walk the short distance, they drove us, I assume because they didn't want us to happen to see much of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Anyway we went to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, left in <span class="populated place">Ravensbruck</span> and then I was a little confused because there was a lot of hocus pocus going on, a <span class="spatial object">train</span> had arrived, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Lot of movement and the Jew was picked up and immediately moved to the left, so I never saw him again, and the other one, there was an SS soldier, I was standing by, I didn't quite understand what, but he asked him something. </sentence><sentence id="1629">The guy gave an answer that offended the SS soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1630">He shot him right there and said to his comrade, he's too old to work anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1631">Not even worth a bullet, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1632">I said, oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Thought for a  2 moment. </sentence><sentence id="1634">His family, will they ever know how he died? </sentence><sentence id="1635">So then I was deloused and when I <span class="interior space">bath</span>, when I was in there, was for the first time in a long time I saw there was a woman prisoner who took care and gave me clothes and allowed us to take a <span class="interior space">shower</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1636">It kind of embarrassed me and I was more embarrassed to blush. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Then I was taken to an , that's one of those guards in charge, and I met the first couple, and I was told which <span class="building">barrack</span> I would go to and you will be part of a commando, you'll do outside work and really there were many <span class="populated place">satellite camps</span> all around because of all kinds of companies had established <span class="building">factories</span> so prisoners would work, and <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> made money with the prisoners, the prisoners weren't paid, but the companies paid the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, so they had an income. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And I wasn't too long, I don't remember how many, but there were three <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, three <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, three <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, one __ the other and I learned eventually that you could buy things in the <span class="building">canteen</span> if you had money and I learned that when one says, do you have any money, do you have any money, the other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1639">I didn't have any money, why do you need money, oh, can buy things. </sentence><sentence id="1640">Somehow I was accompanied by the notice that I was a possible SKP, that was probably part of the dossier that accompanied me from the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1641"><span class="building">SKP</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1642">One who likes to escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1670">Q: <span class="building">SKP</span>, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1672">A: Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1673">And so I was a dangerous one, for watching, so to tell the other guards about me, they had left a crown, like a mark, what's it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1676">Q: ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1678">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1679">I don't know how long they , probably a week there or two. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I was called, well we had a pill every day, which means the big <span class="dlf">square</span>, you see, dance, dance. </sentence><sentence id="1681"><span class="building">Administration building</span>, and <span class="building">barracks</span> and then in the middle, see and the ones that we had built, there was, we had <span class="dlf">masonry walls</span> and there was a section where the masonry were held in front with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, and it was loaded with electricity and I remember one guard, obviously didn't like one of the prisoners, took his head, we wore square hats, threw it away to the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, or in the <span class="dlf">fence</span> , go and pick it up and the prisoner refused. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I told you pick it up and he whipped him and by that time we drove off, so I don't know whether he ever went to pick it up, of course that would mean electrocution, or not. </sentence><sentence id="1683">There was one guard who was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="1684">But I was old enough to appreciate he was gay. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Tried to stay away from him. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So when I heard there was a possibility to go to a <span class="populated place">satellite camp</span> to work in a <span class="dlf">quarry</span>, there I went. </sentence><sentence id="1687">So I went to a <span class="dlf">quarry</span>, which was quite far away so we came only once a week to the main <span class="populated place">camp</span>, change clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Some to receive mail. </sentence><sentence id="1689">I wasn't because my parents didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="1690">And also if you wanted to see the <span class="building">lager doctor</span>, you had the choice. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Very few people did that because the rumor went if you're sick, they're going to liquidate you, so you didn't want to go to the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1692">On one of my trips I was asked to stay because another prisoner was ill and I was destined to clean the <span class="building">clinic</span>, and I had met the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And he was not the mean SOB, he was kind of, oh I don't know whether pleasant is the word, but he was not a sadistic idiot. </sentence><sentence id="1694">So I had made his acquaintance. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, to the <span class="dlf">quarry</span>, which was divided, there was a <span class="building">mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I never knew what  3 they did with the <span class="env feature">rocks</span>, but the different layers, the Russian prisoners were at the bottom, the French prisoners and we were on top and what you had, you had <span class="dlf">rails</span> going up and on top of the privileged character, I had this big, big handle that would bring the <span class="spatial object">lorries</span>, a <span class="spatial object">lorry</span>'s a flat <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, these had sides on them, get them down to the <span class="building">mill</span>, and <span class="spatial object">pump</span>, and empty one up and he would pick it up and then go the <span class="dlf">rail</span> and there you had your little <span class="region">areas</span>, whatever <span class="region">area</span> was destined. </sentence><sentence id="1697">I had one prisoner who showed me how to cut a <span class="dlf">vein</span>, because it's not, you can't be all day long, you have to fill 12 <span class="spatial object">cars</span> a day, that was the 5 means quota. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And boy after a few days, my hand, oh my God, it was raw meat, it was huge, and after that of course if you have time and effort become like leather. </sentence><sentence id="1699">There were two <span class="building">outhouses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">The <span class="building">outhouses</span> had no sides so the guards could see you. </sentence><sentence id="1701">The beginning there was two guards, but towards the end of "44, the younger guards disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1702">There were older ones and one was an invalid, no dogs, everything was a little lax. </sentence><sentence id="1703">If you didn't have 12, you would get no food, so everybody worked like a little bee. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And I remember once picking up a big <span class="env feature">rock</span>, I remember years, years, years, years later I worked picking up some rocks, I lived on a <span class="env feature">rock</span> that was big. </sentence><sentence id="1705">I all the way down to the <span class="env feature">lake</span> to pick up some rocks and people asked me, where'd you learn all about these rocks? </sentence><sentence id="1706">I said you wouldn't believe me. </sentence><sentence id="1707">So I know a lot about <span class="env feature">rocks</span>, but anyway, five o'clock whistle blew and marched, marched down, there was a little <span class="populated place">camp</span> where we slept, we were all passed out. </sentence><sentence id="1708">One thing I remember was one of the most disgusting experiences of my life, we had what we called the thunder beam, a long <span class="spatial object">pole</span>, it was lying over two <span class="spatial object">barrels</span>, it had to open the <span class="dlf">traps</span> where we sat down to do our business one after the other, and then when it was full, you know they would and open another <span class="dlf">trench</span> actually, like a simplified <span class="building">outhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1709">One of the guards had a prisoner cut the <span class="dlf">pole</span> in half, so then when you sit on, of course it gave way with all the weight that we all __in. </sentence><sentence id="1710">There is no manure that is as bad as human manure. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Kitty cats are not as bad as human. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So that was horrible and then of course you came out of it, so they give you 10 minutes to clean up and the ones who didn't come out right again, he sent them back in, oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Anyway I worked there until January of "45, and one day I went to the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to change clothes, I went to the <span class="interior space">public rest room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1714">I sat there in the normal position and I hear tick, tick, tick, tick. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Blood. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Blood came out of my mouth and my nose. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I said that's weird, huh? </sentence><sentence id="1718">I didn't get hurt or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1719">But I lost so much blood that when I got up I passed out, and this guard, he part of a little <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1720">So, the other prisoners kind of liked me, I was the youngest and one cleaned me up and cleaned my uniform so that nobody would get mad at me and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1721">I began to hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1722">Like needles stuck in my lungs and I told, I had a friend, a Russian prisoner, Ivan, I don't know whether that was his real name, but they called himIvan___. </sentence><sentence id="1723">But don't ask for the doctor, it'll be your end. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Nobody has come back after they've seen the doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1725">But I had to know and I just couldn't stand it and so I asked for . </sentence><sentence id="1726">Thad to see the doctor, the doctor for whom I'd cleaned before and I remember his name was Herr Mann(ph) and I said, this is what happened and I've been ____, 1 feel good and I can work and I just want to know, where's all the blood coming from and tapped my shoulders a little bit and looked at me and said, you have tuberculosis, you can't work, oh yes I can, oh yes I can, I can work, yes, oh please let me work, please let me work. </sentence><sentence id="1727">You want to work? </sentence><sentence id="1728">Yes I want to work. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1730">So he signed and I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And there was pain, there was pain and there was pain. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And I said I'm going to get out of here, because I'm dying. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And I planned and I looked around and I said, there's just no way, but I'm  4 going to die. </sentence><sentence id="1734">Days passed, in a few days I thought this is it, I'm going to die, spitting blood, pain, could hardly work. </sentence><sentence id="1735">I came to the point, which is very interesting, when you're hungry you fight, you'll kill for bread. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Then comes a time where your body doesn't demand any more, you give it away. </sentence><sentence id="1737">That's when you're ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="1738">I gave away bread. </sentence><sentence id="1739">But there was this of my, my body couldn't do it any more, but the spirit was still going strong. </sentence><sentence id="1740">So one day the whistle blew and we went up. </sentence><sentence id="1741">It was the foggiest day ever. </sentence><sentence id="1742">Dogs had disappeared and you can hardly see, I mean it was not quite as dense at the <span class="interior space">upper levels</span>.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2065">A: Almost, almost automatically, when people ask me, how long have you been in the <span class="country">states</span>, oh you were , were you in the army? </sentence><sentence id="2066">No. </sentence><sentence id="2067">What'd you do? </sentence><sentence id="2068">Well, I don't volunteer all kinds of information, so I said, well actually I was a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Oh, what a Russian prisoner?No, a German prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2070">Well that of course is a little shocking, I was in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2071">Oh, are you Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="2072">That's the first thing. </sentence><sentence id="2073">Very few people know the concentrations were full of non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2074">That is not to say the majority, but yeah, quite a few, anybody who was not in agreement, or presented some sort of an obstacle to the Third Reich was put away. </sentence><sentence id="2075">Either put away for good or put away in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, or another <span class="populated place">camp</span> of some sort, so I was one of those, so I was, I had fallen in disgrace. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2092">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="2093">No, not really, maybe what, you see, the questions always implied that one preserved this rational thinking and that rational thinking goes away pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="2094">You have all kinds of weird thoughts and you become mentally and physically a kind of wet rag, so to speak, you don't function well any more, you don't ask certain questions, in some instances you don't care any more, so you just go along and like a little <span class="spatial object">robot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2095">So these rational questions, you may ask them in retrospect, but not so much at the time, and you look left and  9 right, you see people being creative, I know some prisoners who were chewing bread and let the bread dry and made little chess figures because they were more eager in playing chess than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="2096">There were others who would denounce anything in order to get a little reward from the SS or from the , so they would sell, probably even sell their own mothers for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2097">You have all kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And we arrive in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> , so things don't change much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2112">A: I don't know whether I can makes sense out of it, but I have been in many places and I see that people kill each other like flies, in <span class="country">Ireland</span> in 1996. </sentence><sentence id="2113">People put bombs there, people put bombs on <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Half a million people died in <span class="country">Rwanda</span>, others are going to die maybe in <span class="country">Burundi</span>, so have things changed? </sentence><sentence id="2115">No they have not. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Is there any <span class="country">country</span> that can say we have never done anything wrong? </sentence><sentence id="2117">No. </sentence><sentence id="2118">I think the Germans are the only ones who did it in the most systematic way. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Others have done it in a more, I mean, the Spaniards have killed probably six million Indians and brought all kinds of diseases over here. </sentence><sentence id="2120">The Americans killed all the Bison so Indians didn't have anything to eat and force marched them all the way to <span class="region">Florida</span> from <span class="region">Oklahoma</span> and so on, so forth, not to speak about the Negroes. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And it's a disgusting chapter in the history. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Look at the French with the, look at the British, first <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> in <span class="country">South Africa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2123">So I don't know what happens in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2124">So if 1 were to accuse, I would accuse humanity, but I wouldn't pick one in particular. </sentence><sentence id="2125">There are people who think that Germans were born to be sadistic, that's not true at all. </sentence><sentence id="2126">They're good ones. </sentence><sentence id="2127">What has happened is a, I think I would be more interested in looking at those who could have prevented and didn't and one of those is these <span class="country">United States of America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2128">I look at <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2129">I look at <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, who made billions and billions of dollars taking advantage of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="2130">Turning Jews back after they had successfully escaped. </sentence><sentence id="2131"><span class="spatial object">Shiploads</span> of Jews who tried to come to <span class="country">America</span>, the chosen <span class="region">land</span>, and were rejected. </sentence><sentence id="2132">Those are a little more interesting to me. </sentence><sentence id="2133">I know what happened, I was there. </sentence><sentence id="2134">Could it happen anywhere else? </sentence><sentence id="2135">Yes it could. </sentence><sentence id="2136">There is the part that is sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2137">That is the part that is tough to understand how humans become such atrocious beasts. </sentence><sentence id="2138">That is tough to digest, to understand. </sentence><sentence id="2139">No, it's not that hard to understand, but to understand the German question, like that, you have to go almost into the history before Christ and definitely bring in the <span class="building">church</span> and definitely bring in whatever that contribute to factors. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Treaty of Versailles, anti-Jewish sentiment at different times in the world, not only in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2141">How one can do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="2142">How can a man rape an innocent girl? </sentence><sentence id="2143">The simple answer is you have to be sick, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2144">Unfortunately a lot of it's probably like when you go to <span class="building">high school</span>, if you say one day, hey guys, why don't we get together this weekend and help some elderly people in a <span class="building">rest home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2145">Nobody shows up. </sentence><sentence id="2146">But if you say hey I got a little <span class="env feature">grass</span>, let's smoke some <span class="building">joint</span> and raise some hell, and screw some girls. </sentence><sentence id="2147">So the negative seems to be more attractive to people, especially those who don't have a very healthy foundation, and so there is no way in the world I can excuse, I cannot justify. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Can I understand? </sentence><sentence id="2149">Yeah, I can understand. </sentence><sentence id="2150">I really resent the fact that I can understand. </sentence><sentence id="2151">I  0 wish I couldn't, but I can. </sentence><sentence id="2152">The first time, after I left <span class="country">Germany</span>, in a <span class="spatial object">cargo train</span>, so here I am escaping again. </sentence><sentence id="2153">After seven years I returned to <span class="country">Germany</span> and I had prepared how to go back and kill the spider. </sentence><sentence id="2154">I remembered him more than any SS guard, especially the Lithuanian SS guards who were the most sadistic ones. </sentence><sentence id="2155">No, the spider, the spider was on my mind day and night. </sentence><sentence id="2156">I had a gun and I went to the <span class="populated place">village</span> in which he lived, the <span class="populated place">village</span> was right next to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2157">And I kind of had rehearsed with myself, nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="2158">I said, do you remember me? </sentence><sentence id="2159">I'm the one who stood in the <span class="dlf">circle</span> four or five times, I'm the one you let suffer. </sentence><sentence id="2160">I'm the one this and this, you remember me now, does it come back to your senses?Then I would have killed him. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I went to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2162">The lady came to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and I said I would like to speak to Dr. , that was his name. </sentence><sentence id="2163">Oh, I'm sorry, but he moved about a month ago, he went to <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Well, I didn't go after him in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> because after that came the moment of reconsideration. </sentence><sentence id="2165">What do I do, what do I do by killing him, what do I establish in that, so then you kind of put it behind. </sentence><sentence id="2166">But that was, that was a moment I will always remember, I went to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and I hoped I would see him. </sentence><sentence id="2167">God, I hated him. </sentence><sentence id="2168">Because you just don't have a right to make a human or an animal suffer to that point. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Unfortunately there are people who derive pleasure from doing that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2239">A: Oh well, there are so many little episodes, but it's not really enjoyable to talk about them. </sentence><sentence id="2240">It's a little tough so I think, but I told you enough really and I was asked before I gave the interview to bring pictures and I'm very sorry to say that the only picture I could find is a picture of me when I was 15 and you see me in the uniform of the Hitler youth and that was I at 15 and I know that this is true, because my mother wrote on the back this is Walter and the picture was taken by my brother Paul in the spring of 1941, so this is two years before I became a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2241">I think the certificates have very little value, I just brought them along. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2245">Q: Do you that closer or just ? </sentence><sentence id="2246">Why don't you just show us that one certificate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: Well this lives any more, but this is a copy, this you'll see is the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> here, this is an organization that sprung up, about right after the liberation and it became known as the Union of Former Political Concentration Camp Prisoners and Political  1 Prisoners and this simply asked the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> and <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and so on to give me a <span class="interior space">seat</span> and be nice to me because I had TB. </sentence><sentence id="2250">This is mainly it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
