<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Could we hold it? </sentence><sentence id="10">Let's ask a little more about your childhood only because people seeing this tape are not necessarily what traditional native Jewish family means. </sentence><sentence id="11">Uh, what for instance, uh, did you eat kosher at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="12">Did you light sabbath candles at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, in uh in the early childhood, uh my parents didn't keep a <span class="building">kosher home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">Uh they did do it however later on when I, just after I was bar mitzvahed, uh they started keeping a <span class="building">kosher home</span>, and also my my mother would light the the sabbath candle. </sentence><sentence id="19">But we would go to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> uh on the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh to please my grandparents I would once in a while go in on the sabbath also but that was really not the, uh something that happened too often. </sentence><sentence id="21">But my parents were very active in <span class="building">Jewish community</span> life. </sentence><sentence id="22">In <span class="country">Denmark</span> my dad belonged to a number of Jewish organizations. </sentence><sentence id="23">He headed one of them and uh now if if only I can translate it properly - it would really correspond to what you would call a brotherhood here. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh, it was meant as support organization where small independent un entrepreneurs, uh business people, tailors, etc., </sentence><sentence id="25">what they, when in need they could loan money to get through a period of time. </sentence><sentence id="26">Then they would repay it. </sentence><sentence id="27">And it was often, it was all organized by this small organization which was quite powerful. </sentence><sentence id="28">And then at the same time the organization also got involved in the promotion of Yiddish culture. </sentence><sentence id="29">Uh they would stage uh performances when there were uh uh Yiddish actors visiting <span class="country">Denmark</span>, etc. </sentence><sentence id="30">Um, now there were at that time and there still are quite a number of Jewish associations in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, in spite of the fact of course that the community was and is rather small. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh today the <span class="populated place">community</span> is about the same size as it was before the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="32">Uh just around 7,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="33">And uh at that time there was a <span class="building">Jewish boys school</span> and there was a <span class="building">Jewish girls school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Now they've been, uh after the war they were combined into one. </sentence><sentence id="35">And it takes the kids up through uh <span class="building">secondary school</span>, through <span class="building">junior high school</span>, but then for further education, uh the kids have to attend the <span class="building">public schools</span> or other <span class="building">private schools</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: You were very young. </sentence><sentence id="56">Did you go to a <span class="building">nursery school</span> of some kind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes, I did go to the new Jewish uh <span class="building">nursery school</span> which was located the same place as the <span class="building">girls" school</span> was at that time. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh, I remember going to the uh <span class="building">nursery school</span>, mostly because I hated it when I was forced to take an afternoon nap. </sentence><sentence id="61">But uh I do remember some of the things that happened at at the <span class="building">nursery school</span>, where we were taught uh things that perhaps you wouldn't be teaching in <span class="building">Christian schools</span> in the sense that uh - well the old Jewish tradition of putting such great emphasis on children's education. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh now I can mention here  that the boys" <span class="building">school</span> took in uh the boys already at the age of five and started teaching them proper Danish etc. </sentence><sentence id="63">etc. </sentence><sentence id="64">Uh where as <span class="building">public schools</span> only took in uh students at the age of seven. </sentence><sentence id="65">So also in the <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, at the age of four or uh, you would be, uh they would start teaching you uh proper subjects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: What did they teach you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="76">It's it's difficult today to say what I learned at the age of three, four and five or, but uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="77">Honestly I can't specify. </sentence><sentence id="78">I couldn't. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: You probably sang songs . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Exactly, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="86">We learned how to spell. </sentence><sentence id="87">We learned the letters and that kind of uh stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: What about outside of <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="92">Uh, what, your playmates, were they all Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="93">Was it a mixed group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: It was definitely a mixed group. </sentence><sentence id="98">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="99">And this was very typical of a Jewish family at that time and even today in <span class="country">Denmark</span> because Jews have lived in <span class="country">Denmark</span> since the 17th century. </sentence><sentence id="100">Uh during the early part of the 17th century the then king who was King Christian IV, declared a <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, in the <span class="region">southern part</span> of (ph), an open <span class="populated place">city</span>, and that  5,000, 5,500. </sentence><sentence id="101">But then in the late "60's, as a result of the unrest and the difficulties in <span class="country">Poland</span>, there was a new influx of Polish Jewish immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="102">Uh, a couple of thousand came in uh just around 1970. </sentence><sentence id="103">And now forms of course an integral part of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="104">But again, uh you asked about Jews in <span class="country">Denmark</span> - did I play with with uh non-Jews as well as Jews, etc. </sentence><sentence id="105">And and I said I certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="106">And this again has to do with the fact that although the Jewish population has received new waves of immigrants through the uh but not waves, but a few times this has happened, the Jewish population in <span class="country">Denmark</span> has always been very much assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh, when you speak about Jews in <span class="country">Denmark</span> you you don't classify them as such, as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="108">You classify them as Danes of Jewish extraction or Jewish religion or Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="109">You don't distinguish between groups whether a person is a Catholic or Jewish or he is uh Lutheran or he's an atheist. </sentence><sentence id="110">Uh, this could be due to the fact also that the <span class="building">church</span> in <span class="country">Denmark</span> has for centuries not really been powerful. </sentence><sentence id="111">You know, something like 90- odd percent of the Danish population belongs to the <span class="building">State church</span> which is the <span class="building">Lutheran Church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">But if you look at <span class="building">church</span> attendance in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, it's down to a few percent. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, this has to do with the fact that that you don't you don't feel that there is a difference between, when as a kid, playing with uh Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="114">I I guess that to go on from there, there weren't anti-Semitists. </sentence><sentence id="115">There really hasn't, for a long, long time, has had no real meaning in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh, what perhaps could be percei... uh conceived as anti- Semitism, anti-Semitism, in the sense that there's a word - to steal, from old, old Danish or northern which is called "to Jew" something. </sentence><sentence id="117">The person using that word, the non-  German's, the German influence in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, while <span class="country">Denmark</span> was being occupied by them. </sentence><sentence id="118">And in in the beginning it seemed that it was possible. </sentence><sentence id="119">The Danish government stayed on as a government. </sentence><sentence id="120">The Danish police force was allowed to continue. </sentence><sentence id="121">Uh the Danish army as such was disbanded and so was the uh the navy, but the police force remained the controlling uh force in <span class="country">Denmark</span> and of the many, no, let me put it another way - uh of course there was a lot of give and take between the Germans and the Danes at that time on on an <span class="interior space">official level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">But one of the things that was made abundantly clear to the Germans was that the Danes would never accept the execution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="123">The Jewish issue was not an issue in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, and would not be. </sentence><sentence id="124">The government could not tolerate that it be made an issue. </sentence><sentence id="125">And this was respected by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="126">Uh, I don't remember much from the first few years of the war. </sentence><sentence id="127">Uh the clearest impact was from just a month before, when we speak about the war I mean, there were a lot of things from my childhood, but but this also actually goes to to to indicate that the changes in the daily life were not that many. </sentence><sentence id="128">But I remember clearly on August the 28th, 1943, uh we had our annual family tour of the <span class="dlf">Tivoli Gardens</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">The Tivoli Gardens are something completely unique for <span class="country">Denmark</span> - it's an <span class="building">amusement park</span>; it's a <span class="dlf">flower garden</span>; it's got 23 <span class="building">restaurants</span>; and it's right smack in the center of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>; and it, there is no entertainment or <span class="building">amusement park</span> in the world like it. </sentence><sentence id="130">I'm Dane and I'm proud of it and I'll insist there's nothing like it. </sentence><sentence id="131">And for a kid being taken to the <span class="building">Tivoli Garden</span> was usually the highlight of the summer season and we had been in, was normally once during the, early part of the season which starts in, around the first of May and then one the late uh part of the season. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I remember clearly that evening on the uh August the 29, I'm sorry - August 28, 1943, when leaving the <span class="dlf">Gardens</span> there was a crowd in the <span class="dlf">street</span> looking on as an enormous convoy of <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> rode through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> of <span class="country">Denmark</span>, of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">Of course, as a kid, I didn't know that the cause of it was that it had come to an impasse between the Danish government and the German occupation forces. </sentence><sentence id="134">And on the following day the pow... the Danish government stepped down, refused to cooperate with the Germans any longer. </sentence><sentence id="135">And the Police Corps, the Danish police force uh was disbanded at, rather they were sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, a large number of the Danish police. </sentence><sentence id="136">But this I guess is one of the early, of earliest clear memories I have from the war. </sentence><sentence id="137">But there's another, there's another memory which perhaps, I don't know - I think it's actually half a year or year earlier - uh being called out in the <span class="dlf">street</span> by my elder brother in early evening to see a fantastic red hue over the evening sky and that turned out to be a sabotage, the effect of a sabotage of I think the <span class="building">Danish sugar factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">So that they shouldn't be supplying to the German troops. </sentence><sentence id="139">And you could see simply the fire lighting off the <span class="env feature">evening sky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">It could have been half a year earlier but I'm not, I'm not completely sure of the of the date of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Did your brother later tell you what this was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: No, I 1 remember, I I remember having heard, hearing these are the <span class="building">sugar factories</span> going up. </sentence><sentence id="188">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="189">Uh, then uh I remember after August 29, 1943, which was really the crucial day in the occupation history, the German occupation history of <span class="country">Denmark</span>, because uh I think to a large extent the Danish population wanted to disassociate themselves completely from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="190">Uh now one shouldn't forget that <span class="country">Germany</span> for more than 100 years - that's not quite true - let's say from 1849 - has always been considered the big brother down  <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had, <span class="country">Denmark</span> had wars against <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1849 - we were lucky at that time - there were some other <span class="country">nations</span> that helped us beat the Germans, but in 1864 we were severely beaten and part of the Danish, <span class="region">southern Danish territory</span> was taken away from them and and taken over by <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">Part of that <span class="region">territory</span> was was given back to <span class="country">Denmark</span> after the 1st World War in 1919, but there's always been an an apprehension against these very very powerful Germans just south of the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">So to go back to to August 29, 1943, I think for a large part of the population, there was a bit of an urgency to disassociate themselves from the Germans and they, I think many of them heaved a sigh of relief that finally the Danish government refused to further cooperation. </sentence><sentence id="194">Uh everybody knew I guess, I'm speaking about the adults, everybody knew no doubt that it would mean uh hardships because now the Germans were in total power, total control. </sentence><sentence id="195">But uh on the other hand uh people couldn't accept uh how the Germans were behaving in Europe and such because although the press was completely censored and controlled by the Germans - one shouldn't forget that the <span class="building">BBC</span> was broadcasting all the time and although of course it was under strict penalty to listen to <span class="building">BBC</span> everybody did it. </sentence><sentence id="196">And information about <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and what had happened to minority groups, what was happening to minority groups, as to all the Jews in Europe, had started to had started to come up to their <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: What was, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="210">What was the atmosphere of your family at this time, after the 29th? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: After the 29th, very much an atmosphere of apprehension, that uh something bad could happen and that we should be prepared for it and that perhaps we would have to leave our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">This did happen, the talk about that, during the month of uh September. </sentence><sentence id="215">And now the whole atmosphere in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> changed very much uh because there was a curfew on after the 29th of August and you could feel that things were not going the right way. </sentence><sentence id="216">I think that even a kid at that time could feel it, and perhaps what the kid could feel most was the apprehension of his parents. </sentence><sentence id="217">And all the elders. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh, but still I would say that when it happened, that day that my dad came <span class="building">home</span> in the early afternoon, and he usually worked very very hard - uh leave very early in the morning and come <span class="building">home</span> rather late - but when he came <span class="building">home</span> and said, pack up your or rather don't pack up your things, because we're not going to take any <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>, but put on as many clothes as you could possibly have on you without being very conspicuous uh - it did come as a surprise that we had to leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="219">And that was on, let's see now, September 30th, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="220">That means that it was actually the day before the you you might perhaps have heard that there was a warning issued to the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and that was on October Ist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Were you in the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and did you hear ...? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Your father came <span class="building">home</span> and said you had to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, I said we we were told that uh uh that we couldn't bring any <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="238">That we should put on as many warm clothes as we possibly could, and we went over and stayed over night with uh some friends of my parents, some Christian friends of uh of my parents, and we were told that we would just be staying for one night, which also happened. </sentence><sentence id="239">And and the following morning, we went, the whole family, to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, and took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> down to the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh, I remember that, again this happened time and again during the escape to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, that we were told try not to be conspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="241">That's very very important. </sentence><sentence id="242">And, well, I would say that I understood that this was serious, but I did also feel that to some extent this was an adventure. </sentence><sentence id="243">I don't think you can expect much else from from a six year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="244">Uh there was definitely an element of adventure involved. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh there's one instant that, from that <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride which took about four to five hours, that I very very clearly remember ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="256">Four to five, or forty-five? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="260">Four to five. </sentence><sentence id="261">Four or five hours. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh if we had a map I could show you, but I've got it in the back. </sentence><sentence id="263">It doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh I remember we were sitting in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>; and suddenly I saw the <span class="dlf">door</span> open at the other end of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">And my uh mother's younger sister with her husband came in. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I was about to say something to my mother about it, and my dad looked at me and said, "Don't talk. </sentence><sentence id="267">Don't say hello. </sentence><sentence id="268">Don't greet them." </sentence><sentence id="269">Again it was...and I found that very strange, of course. </sentence><sentence id="270">But afterwards, I was told that no it was just that people shouldn't notice that something unusual was going on. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now, we came down to this <span class="populated place">southern Danish city</span> called <span class="populated place">Nykobing Falster</span>, which is on an <span class="env feature">island</span> <span class="region">south of Zealand</span> [Dan: <span class="env feature">Sjaelland</span>], which is the <span class="env feature">island</span> where you got the <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> . </sentence><sentence id="272">And we were put up </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="274">Did you hear any details, any rumors of how those people got there? </sentence><sentence id="275">Any sense of organization behind this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Only afterwards I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="277">I heard afterwards that this <span class="dlf">route</span> that we followed was organized and financed to a large extent uh by a very very well-known uh Danish business man, uh Christian business man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: His name was Buglon Jansen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="283">He owned and operated uh kind of small <span class="building">department store</span> and <span class="spatial object">household articles</span> right in the center of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> on the <span class="dlf">City Hall Square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">Was a very well-known personality. </sentence><sentence id="285">And - but we had this, this must have been, now we are speaking about the 30's, we left on the 30th, now we are speaking about the 2nd of October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="291">You are still at this <span class="building">hotel</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: My mother has always been a very very calm person. </sentence><sentence id="604">Always very much in control uh of herself and although my dad was a very very strong personality, the typical Jewish father, uh the patriarch of of the family, my mother certainly proved that she could run the family during his absence. </sentence><sentence id="605">Uh I think that you asked me before what it meant to to a six year old boy or seven year old boy to live under such conditions - I think it's true for all of us that we matured very much from the experience and we learned to cope with things. </sentence><sentence id="606">Well, you have to. </sentence><sentence id="607">So out of necessity we learned how to manage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: What did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="614">What did coping mean? </sentence><sentence id="615">What kinds of things . . . ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: Well, I don't I don't think our world was much different from other kids but perhaps still there was a feeling that it was very important to behave so as not to create more problems because we were all aware as kids that it was a very difficult time for our parents. </sentence><sentence id="620">And it's not that we didn't misbehave. </sentence><sentence id="621">Of course we did. </sentence><sentence id="622">We were kids. </sentence><sentence id="623">But I think that we had, we we had a perception of try not to create more problems than necessary. </sentence><sentence id="624">Now whether my parents felt the same way I'm not sure, although I am because my parents have afterwards commented that we did behave uh extremely well as kids during these very trying years. </sentence><sentence id="625">But of course we we made the same kind of tricks as all other kids did but there was still this sense of there's a limit to what you can do, allow yourself to do because it is causing additional problems for the grown-ups. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: You know, I was, I remember, much to my surprise, I didn't recognize the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">I had been away for a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="745">I had been so absorbed first in living the Swedish way with the <span class="building">Swedish schools</span>, then living a normal life in <span class="populated place">Geteborg</span> that the year and a half I didn't remember the <span class="dlf">road</span>, I didn't recall the <span class="dlf">road</span> really, or didn't remember the <span class="building">buildings</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span> going from the from the <span class="building">railroad station</span> to where we were staying but when we came to where we were staying I remembered it all. </sentence><sentence id="746">But this was like, to me <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> was was really at that time was like visiting a new <span class="populated place">city</span> for the first time until I got to the place where we were living, because that was just across from uh where we had, where we used to have our <span class="interior space">flat</span> or our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: Had the <span class="populated place">city</span> been damaged? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="754">Not much. </sentence><sentence id="755">Not not compared to to other <span class="populated place">cities</span> in <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">Uh there was some damage but nothing compared uh to what you saw in other places, but what was remarkable was due to the shortages of all kinds during the war, you saw very very few <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="757">You saw <span class="spatial object">horse-drawn carriages</span> and <span class="spatial object">carts</span> but very very few <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="758">And that lasted for about four or five months, and then you saw the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> coming back. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Very very warm. </sentence><sentence id="774">Extremely warm. </sentence><sentence id="775">Uh, I guess for them also there was little doubt that we would be returning. </sentence><sentence id="776">This was just an an episode. </sentence><sentence id="777">It was something temporary, that we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="778">Uh, again, let me go back all the way to what I said before or in the beginning - Jews in <span class="country">Denmark</span> was not an isolated ethnic minority group. </sentence><sentence id="779">They were Danish of Jewish extraction. </sentence><sentence id="780">So they, we were neighbors and nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="781">I guess this is a very important aspect when when we talk about what happened uh during the 2nd World War in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="782">And then I know that, I've uh given a few speeches on the events of October "43 in <span class="country">Denmark</span> and I know it's said well but look at other <span class="country">countries</span> where people also assimilated and it didn't help them. </sentence><sentence id="783">But this is just one of the other ones because you must take it as a whole where the important part being the proximity to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, the fact that the Germans were disorganized in October "43. </sentence><sentence id="784">Not disorganized but unorganized. </sentence><sentence id="785">They had not yet established their own civilian uh fleets, <span class="spatial object">patrol fleets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="786">Uh there were many Germans sympathetic to the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="787">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="788">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="789">The worst part, the the worst uh were really the the Danish Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="790">There were a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="791">But but no large number but there were they were there and they were uh they were rather influential. </sentence><sentence id="792">One shouldn't forget that the warning to the Danish Jews about the uh the impending persecution was given by uh a staff officer of the <span class="building">German Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="793">Uh.. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: Contradictions abound. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A: Well, I don't think so, no. </sentence><sentence id="832">Uh for me personally, yes. </sentence><sentence id="833">But there were distant relatives who were caught and who were affected by it, for life. </sentence><sentence id="834">My dad was affected by it for life. </sentence><sentence id="835">Uh, it was said at I don't know - well, he turned white-haired over night. </sentence><sentence id="836">Uh I know he was white- haired uh all during the the late forties, and the fifties, and sixties, although he was, in 1943 he was 30 years old. </sentence><sentence id="837">But it affected distant relatives who had uh close close relatives taken by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="838">Uh, it, but that's the negative part of it but in the positive, there was also a positive effect on this very very close knit family, getting even, becoming even closer. </sentence><sentence id="839">Uh, did did things change from what they had been before? </sentence><sentence id="840">Perhaps not, perhaps not because sure enough my dad came <span class="building">home</span> and had to start all over again, but was very successful with that also. </sentence><sentence id="841">Uh it didn't change our attitude of how we felt towards neighbors or how neighbors felt towards us. </sentence><sentence id="842">Uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="843">We at the same time as appreciating all the good things that had happened under such a situation of crises, I don't know if perhaps because of knowing what the Germans did - not the Germans, the Nazis - I think one should distinguish there - that uh there was a tendency to grow more cynic than had been the case before. </sentence><sentence id="844">If you were to ask me if my life would have been different if I hadn't had that experience as a kid, uh I guess yeah, it could have. </sentence><sentence id="845">I guess it could have been different. </sentence><sentence id="846">Uh, it could have been different in my relationship first of all with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="847">But in my...  7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: You've just. . . </sentence><sentence id="866">how do you thing it would have been different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="869">A: Well, I think this had the the very positive effect of creating this extremely close-knit family. </sentence><sentence id="870">Uh with family values, the old traditional values being perhaps even more respected than if we hadn't been through this as a family together. </sentence><sentence id="871">You've seen all over the <span class="region">Western world</span> the break-up of the family pattern, and uh a crisis situation like this of course works the other, the opposite way. </sentence><sentence id="872">Uh, but it could have been another type of crisis of course. </sentence><sentence id="873">It could have. </sentence><sentence id="874">Uh, but of course it also makes one appreciate the kind of <span class="country">country</span> I'm living in or rather I'm coming from. </sentence><sentence id="875">Again uh you perhaps you've met it yourself as an American, but Danes feel extremely embarrassed today more than 45 years after the events, to be reminded of their good deeds, and that this was the miracle. </sentence><sentence id="876">Uh being Danish of Jewish family I can see both sides of it. </sentence><sentence id="877">Uh I can see that to some extent it was a miracle but that the miracle also to some extent had natural causes. </sentence><sentence id="878">Uh, but I mean it when I say that that Danes feel embarrassed when being praised today for their actions in October 1943, and it's not out of modesty. </sentence><sentence id="879">But it's out of surprise why anybody should praise them for doing something for their fellow Danes. </sentence><sentence id="880">This was not done for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="881">It was done for fellow Danes. </sentence><sentence id="882">And I think that is worthwhile to note. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: Well yeah, in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Denmark</span> it would be almost from the <span class="region">north</span> to the <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: Uh I knew that it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="926">There's little doubt about that. </sentence><sentence id="927">I certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="928">I knew that we were exposing ourselves to some grave risks. </sentence><sentence id="929">What those risks were I was not quite uh aware of, but I knew it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="930">At at anything that I did as a kid not, not by not doing what I was told, could put our family at risk. </sentence><sentence id="931">I was aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="932">So in that sense I think I knew that I had to act very responsibly. </sentence><sentence id="933">And then we go back to the question about maturity. </sentence><sentence id="934">OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
