( </sentence><sentence id="97">Pause) When the Germans came in it was still...we didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="98">We didn't know even when people, refugees were coming in from from the other side, from the German occupied <span class="country">Poland</span>, from <span class="country">Poland</span> occupied by the Germans, they used to come in and they used to tell us stories how the Germans used to take away Jews and they never came back and all kinds of stories about the German, SS  <span class="country">Germany</span> but we didn't believe them. </sentence><sentence id="99">We said it couldn't happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="100">They couldn't be so mean. </sentence><sentence id="101">It's such a civilized <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">It couldn't be so bad. </sentence><sentence id="103">But after a while we did find out that it happen to us too, because when the Germans came in, in the beginning they didn't know who is a Jew and who is not a Jew, and but our non-Jewish neighbors used to point out the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="104">The kids with whom we used to play outside in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> or on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they used to point point out a Jew, because we lived altogether in the same <span class="region">section</span> and they used to take away the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="105">The SS with the help of the Ukrainian police or the Lithuanian police, they used to take away the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="106">Whenever we used to stand in <span class="dlf">line</span>, they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the <span class="dlf">lines</span> and every once in a while they used to come in to our <span class="building">houses</span> and take away some people and...it was a very scary time for us, especially for the young people, because we didn't know what [they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always, every time we saw a German, and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="107">Until five o'clock in the evening we were allowed to walk and we weren't allowed to walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="108">We had to walk in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and bow for every German. </sentence><sentence id="109">It it was a very scary time. </sentence><sentence id="110">We didn't know who is going to be next and what's going to happen to us and we we weren't allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> anymore and life was going on like that until "41 right before the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="111">They...the SS decided to make a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, in <span class="populated place">Vilno</span> and there a <span class="region">poor section</span> where a lot of Jews used to live there and the <span class="building">Jewish home</span> for the aged was there. </sentence><sentence id="112">The biggest <span class="building">synagogue</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Vilno</span> was there. </sentence><sentence id="113">The <span class="building">orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">The <span class="building">Jewish hospital</span> was there, and a lot of poor Jews lived around this <span class="region">section</span> and one night the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanians, they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a place, <span class="populated place">Ponary</span> [in the] outskirts of <span class="populated place">Vilno</span> there and they shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="115">We heard screaming and yelling and crying during the night, but we weren't allowed to look of the <span class="dlf">window</span> because those who looked out were shot. </sentence><sentence id="116">We didn't know what was going on anyway until the next day our neighbors told us what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="117">We had a lot of relatives there. </sentence><sentence id="118">My mother's cousins, all of my mother's relatives lived there and couple of weeks later they round up all the Jews from the <span class="populated place">city</span> and the <span class="region">suburbs</span> and they put us all in this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and surrounded us with <span class="dlf">walls</span> and with guards and we had to live in one <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, two to three families in a <span class="interior space">two room apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">When we came in those <span class="building">apartments</span>, we saw some of the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> were still made still where people were still asleep. </sentence><sentence id="120">They were disturbed. </sentence><sentence id="121">They took them out in the middle of the night from the <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">Some the <span class="spatial object">tables</span> were still set. </sentence><sentence id="123">People evidently were still eating, and this made a very bad impression of us, for us because our relatives, our our families were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="124">They were killed. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had the <span class="spatial object">Judenrat</span>, <span class="building">Kehilla</span> changed the name to <span class="spatial object">Judenrat</span> and my father was still working in the <span class="spatial object">Judenrat</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="126">We had our own police there. </sentence><sentence id="127">They organized <span class="building">police</span>, <span class="building">fire department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">They had <span class="building">stores</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">We had even <span class="building">schools</span> for children. </sentence><sentence id="130">The little kids used to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">I personally was too old to go to <span class="building">school</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="132">When the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live. </sentence><sentence id="133">At first they gave us yellow cards. </sentence><sentence id="134">Those who didn't get a yellow card were taken away from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and we never saw those people. ( </sentence><sentence id="135">and a couple months..) We used to, people used to go out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to work in <span class="building">factories</span> or in <span class="building">railroad station</span>, wherever they  needed some help, workers, they sent out our Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="136">And couple months later they decided to change those cards again for different kind of cards. </sentence><sentence id="137">Pink cards, and then they took away those that didn't have any pink cards and we never saw those people again. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it was pretty frightening all the time. </sentence><sentence id="139">Every time they used to give us a little more bread or horse meat we knew that's it's going to be a roundup of Jews the next couple days. </sentence><sentence id="140">They even came in one day, the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanian police and took away all the children from <span class="building">school</span>, and those little kids never had a chance to say goodbye to their parents. </sentence><sentence id="141">The parents, when they came <span class="building">home</span> from work they didn't find their kids anymore. </sentence><sentence id="142">We we lived all the time in fright; we were frightened all the time. </sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't know what was going to be next or who is going to be next. </sentence><sentence id="144">One time they caught my father walking on a <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">They round him [up] too, but he escaped from there somehow. </sentence><sentence id="146">I don't remember how, but he did escape. </sentence><sentence id="147">My mother was sick at the time in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and she died. </sentence><sentence id="148">She was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and we didn't have enough medication to help her, and she died in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> even to see where she was buried. </sentence><sentence id="150">My father went because he helped to dig the <span class="dlf">grave</span> in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and he knew exactly where, but the children weren't allowed to go out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">We lived in fear all the time. </sentence><sentence id="152">And every day was about the same thing as the previous day. </sentence><sentence id="153">We didn't know...then right before the holidays in 1943, right before the Jewish holidays, the New Year, the SS decided to liquidate the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and they told us over the loudspeaker that the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is going to be liquidated and we are going to be resettled. </sentence><sentence id="154">They didn't tell us where, and and we can take only what we can carry with us, no more. </sentence><sentence id="155">Naturally we didn't have much what to carry, only our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="156">That's all we could take. </sentence><sentence id="157">And the next day we all congregated at the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and they took us to a <span class="dlf">field</span> in right outskirts of <span class="populated place">Vilno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I don't remember the name where it was, but when we came to the <span class="dlf">field</span> we saw three people hanging, a young woman, and two young men and they told us over the loudspeaker that in case somebody has in mind to run away, to escape from this <span class="dlf">field</span>, will be shot or hanged right in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="159">Men were taken away separately from the women. </sentence><sentence id="160">The men were taken to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="country">Estonia</span> and there they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="161">They were all burned alive for...they put logs and people and logs and burned and brought gasoline in and burned them and couple a years ago when we were in <span class="country">Israel</span>, we went to visit the <span class="populated place">kibbutz Lokhamei haGettaoth</span> and I saw the picture how they put up the people and I saw my father's name and his number and it was very emotional to see. </sentence><sentence id="162">Then how thorough the Germans were to record all what was happening to these Jews and we had to stay the whole night in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, the women. </sentence><sentence id="163">Only my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a very cold, miserable, rainy evening. </sentence><sentence id="165">When a child was crying or baby was crying, our guards used to take away the child from the mother and take it for (by?) </sentence><sentence id="166">their feet and tear it in half and throw it back to the mother. </sentence><sentence id="167">Some mothers, from fright, even choked their own children. ( </sentence><sentence id="168">Pause) It was going on like this the whole night. </sentence><sentence id="169">The next morning, we stayed in <span class="dlf">line</span> and we were sorted. </sentence><sentence id="170">Those who went left went to <span class="populated place">extermination camps</span> like <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> or <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> or some other <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and I was fortunate enough with my sister went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was lucky enough that they put us...they sorted us the same... they didn't separate us, and we went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="172">Then they put us in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span>, about a hundred women to a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and no <span class="interior space">bathrooms</span>, no food, no  water. </sentence><sentence id="173">We had to ride for a couple of days in the <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> until we came to <span class="country">Latvia</span>, to <span class="populated place">Kaiserwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">That's a suburb of <span class="populated place">Riga</span>, and we were met by SS men and they told us that this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> is built on <span class="dlf">Jewish graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">All the Jews from <span class="populated place">Riga</span> were concentrated there. </sentence><sentence id="176">They were shot and they buried them and they built the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="177">We had to go through the <span class="interior space">showers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">They shaved our heads in case somebody will run away they should find [her], they should know that we are the Jews from the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="179">They gave us stripped clothes with numbers. </sentence><sentence id="180">From then on we never were called by the name, only by the number. </sentence><sentence id="181">Then they put us in <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">We had to sleep on <span class="spatial object">boards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">No blankets, no pillows. </sentence><sentence id="184">We used to get up five o'clock in the morning and be counted and sometimes our kapo made a mistake in counting us, [then] we had to stay for another couple of hours and for punishment. </sentence><sentence id="185">Then they used to give us a piece of bread and some black water that they called coffee and we used to go out to work from the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> to dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> or at the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> or in <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="186">Some people were lucky enough worked in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> sorting the clothes that they took away from us and while I was working digging <span class="dlf">ditches</span>, there was a guard who asked me from where I was and I told him that I was from <span class="populated place">Vilno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">Then I asked him where ...and he told me is from <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">I said oh, I told him that my mother comes from <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">He asked me from where, and I told him from where, from <span class="populated place">Vilkoviskis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">He says oh he comes from there too, and he knew my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="191">They were friends before the war. </sentence><sentence id="192">They went to <span class="building">school</span> together and they were very good friends, and he told me how my uncle was killed in <span class="populated place">Vilkoviskis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">They shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't take them in any <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> or in any <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="195">They shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="196">And then we used to come back to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and be counted again and then they took us and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">In the <span class="building">barracks</span> we used to sit and talk, talk about old times, talk about our parents and the <span class="building">schools</span> that we went to and every once in a while, couple times a week, a German SS woman used to come in with a big whip and beat us up without any reason. </sentence><sentence id="198">Used to curse us. </sentence><sentence id="199">Used to yell at us. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was very frightening. </sentence><sentence id="201">We never knew what time it was. </sentence><sentence id="202">We never knew what day it was, because we didn't have any <span class="spatial object">clocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">We didn't have any <span class="spatial object">watches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">We didn't have any calendars. </sentence><sentence id="205">We didn't know anything what was going on in this world. </sentence><sentence id="206">Then one day, beginning of 1944 or so or in the middle, somewhere around there, they told us that the next day they are going to take us to another <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and they took us again by <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="region">east Germany</span> somewhere, called <span class="building">Stuthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">When we came there they took away everything what we had again and they shaved our heads again. </sentence><sentence id="208">They gave us different numbers, but it was much worse in this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="210">We had to stay in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> all the time. </sentence><sentence id="211">We weren't allowed to go to the <span class="interior
