<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was still employed by the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="834">I got my monthly check and we could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="835">However, my mother remained at the time still in that <span class="populated place">village</span> where I was born. </sentence><sentence id="836">My father has died already, so I brought her up to...to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and she lived for a very short while in our <span class="building">house</span> and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the <span class="building">Rabbinical Seminary</span> at the <span class="building">University</span> because that was...uh...the <span class="building">Seminary</span> student had to finish <span class="building">college</span> as well. </sentence><sentence id="837">They had to get a degree from the <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="838">So in order to save him from <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> when he came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...<span class="building">Seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="839">It was no problem because he had a tremendous amount of Hebrew knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="840">And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we wanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span>. </sentence><sentence id="841">For instance, we...we needed some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was the superintendent of our <span class="building">buildings</span> in <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span>, they sent up...I don't know...geese and whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="842">Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to the <span class="building">store</span> at any time during the day and buy anything. </sentence><sentence id="843">They had a certain hour or two...I don't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. </sentence><sentence id="844">And of course when they...when they could go out everything was gone. </sentence><sentence id="845">It was a very, very hard life with a lot of things missing. </sentence><sentence id="846">We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in <span class="populated place">Yugo</span>...in <span class="populated place">Yugo</span>...again that was formerly <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> was <span class="country">Hungary</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="847">They helped us out with many things. </sentence><sentence id="848">Now, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the big congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much. </sentence><sentence id="849">However, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it was handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="850">And so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="872">Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general. </sentence><sentence id="873">Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this is against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="874">I did one more thing in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now. </sentence><sentence id="875">This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a <span class="region">district</span> in the <span class="region">7th district</span>, which didn't exist before. </sentence><sentence id="876">People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own <span class="building">homes</span> and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="877">One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="878">One family had old  3 people; the other had the young people and children. </sentence><sentence id="879">But they were moved together in <span class="building">apartments</span>, and other <span class="building">apartments</span> were taken away because there were some <span class="populated place">districts</span> where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live. </sentence><sentence id="880">Now, I organized the <span class="populated place">7th inner district</span> at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher <span class="building">home</span>; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one <span class="interior space">apartment</span> instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available. </sentence><sentence id="881">And I was the secretary of that 6th...<span class="populated place">7th district</span> for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so that the Jews would be together already. </sentence><sentence id="882">And this was done. </sentence><sentence id="883">Now what is your next question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="898">Q: What happened to you as the years progressed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: As the years progressed, 1940...Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was <span class="building">home</span> for 4 weeks and then called back to the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> and was there for 2 months let's say. </sentence><sentence id="901">And I had the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to come <span class="building">home</span> for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or Shuef. </sentence><sentence id="902">So I came <span class="building">home</span> and I stayed <span class="building">home</span> for...for the time I was allowed to stay <span class="building">home</span>...to stay <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="903">And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months. </sentence><sentence id="904">Summer months we almost constantly were in <span class="populated place">camp</span> and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...g0 <span class="building">home</span> and we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="905">Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. </sentence><sentence id="906">In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span>, came for a visit to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="907">And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny, was a very small child. </sentence><sentence id="908">He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all her heart, she told my wife, her sister, "Look, the child has a cold. </sentence><sentence id="909">He's coughing and all that. </sentence><sentence id="910"><span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span> is still about a 100 kilometer south. </sentence><sentence id="911">I will take him down. </sentence><sentence id="912">Maybe his cough with subside easier there." </sentence><sentence id="913">So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there were two chief cantors in <span class="building">Temple</span> that my colleague who was with me will take over all my duties for Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="914">There were many, many weddings and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="915">He will take over, and I will take over for him the next time when it's his next. </sentence><sentence id="916">So we went down to <span class="populated place">Novi Sad</span> on Thursday and stayed with this sister-in-law in her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and Friday morning before...at dawn, my father-in-law, who lived close by, came over to his daughter, to us, to tell her, tell us, inform us that there is a pogrom outside and the Jews and ____ are picked up and congregated somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="917">So it was a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="918">That was a Friday. </sentence><sentence id="919">We...we waited in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="920">About 11:00 the gendarme with full glairy, fixed up with his machine gun and all that came to take us to a certain spot where the Jews were con...were gathered, and from there they were marched down to the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>. </sentence><sentence id="921">We didn't know that this will happen, but this is what it was. </sentence><sentence id="922">The Jew...the ____ and the Jews were down...were taken down to the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="923">The <span class="env feature">Danube River</span> was frozen maybe...I don't know how many inches thick, but they...they threw some...uh...material, some military bomb or something into the <span class="env feature">water</span>, probed the....uh...the thing open...ice, the ice open and took the people into a place where they had to undress and naked to go on the <span class="spatial object">trampoline</span> which was over the  4 <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>, and they were shot into the <span class="env feature">River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="924">They were shot and fell into the <span class="env feature">River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="925">Now, this went on for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="926">We saw <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> arriving there with ___ and Jewish people and they were all put into a <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="927">I think a <span class="dlf">line</span> of two and there was always a gendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people who are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies of <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="928">The really...the newly occu...back occupied <span class="country">Hungary</span> because you know that was <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="929">It was <span class="country">Hungary</span>, then <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, then the Hungarians occupied it again. </sentence><sentence id="930">So when our next came, before us was standing the owner of the <span class="building">house</span>...uh... where my sister- in-law lived. </sentence><sentence id="931">When our next came, the policeman came over. </sentence><sentence id="932">I was holding Manny in my coat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and said...uh..."What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="933">Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="934">You are not a Czechnik?" </sentence><sentence id="935">Czechnik meant the...the people who hated <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">The serp people and others who hated <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="937">You are no Czechnik. </sentence><sentence id="938">And he was all terribly excited, and ran over to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, "The...the Chief Cantor from the _____ is here. </sentence><sentence id="939">He's...he's not a <span class="spatial object">cheknik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="940">He's...I know him, and I "m there many times." </sentence><sentence id="941">Namely, as I told you before, the <span class="building">Temple</span> was a very narrow <span class="dlf">street</span> and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman. </sentence><sentence id="942">So he knew me very well. </sentence><sentence id="943">And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside. </sentence><sentence id="944">Stand him...let him stand aside." </sentence><sentence id="945">This saved our lives because <span class="building">Hortee</span> (pause - drinking water) <span class="building">Hortee</span> then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our . </sentence><sentence id="946">So if anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't believe it, but it's true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
