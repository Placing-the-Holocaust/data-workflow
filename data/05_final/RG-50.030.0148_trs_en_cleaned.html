<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="620">Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general. </sentence><sentence id="621">Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this is against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="622">I did one more thing in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now. </sentence><sentence id="623">This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a <span class="region">district</span> in the <span class="region">7th district</span>, which didn't exist before. </sentence><sentence id="624">People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own <span class="building">homes</span> and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="625">One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="626">One family had old  3 people; the other had the young people and children. </sentence><sentence id="627">But they were moved together in <span class="building">apartments</span>, and other <span class="building">apartments</span> were taken away because there were some <span class="populated place">districts</span> where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live. </sentence><sentence id="628">Now, I organized the <span class="populated place">7th inner district</span> at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher <span class="building">home</span>; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one <span class="interior space">apartment</span> instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available. </sentence><sentence id="629">And I was the secretary of that 6th...<span class="populated place">7th district</span> for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so that the Jews would be together already. </sentence><sentence id="630">And this was done. </sentence><sentence id="631">Now what is your next question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
