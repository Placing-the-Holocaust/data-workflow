government because I suppose the Legation had to discuss with the government who goes and who doesn't. </sentence><sentence id="796">The <span class="building">buildings</span> were apparently, what I learned later, vacated with everybody who lived in the <span class="building">building</span> and given to the <span class="building">Spanish Legation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="797">All these <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="798">The people, they lived in the <span class="building">building</span>, whether they were Gentiles, Christians, whatever, they had to leave the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="799">So they had a hard time probably through this too. </sentence><sentence id="800">Any how, so Havier when he came to the <span class="building">house</span>, to the <span class="building">David Street house</span>, I asked him during the conversation... told him that my father was already taken. </sentence><sentence id="801">He said, "He can be on the document too." </sentence><sentence id="802">And he is on the document, his picture. </sentence><sentence id="803">I said, "Where...how will be this...this departure?" </sentence><sentence id="804">He said, "I'll let you know when you have to go to the <span class="dlf">St. Stephens Park</span> when it's ready to be...to move there." </sentence><sentence id="805">And on that particular night, I asked, "What is your name?" </sentence><sentence id="806">And he said to me, "My name is Havier ." </sentence><sentence id="807">That's how I remember those years. </sentence><sentence id="808">Forget that many years passed by and that name was in my mind since I speak Spanish, and in the meantime I learned Snanish. </sentence><sentence id="809">I lived in a <span class="country">Latin country</span> and so I was in mv mind. </sentence><sentence id="810">And he mentioned also  9 to...to the <span class="building">Spanish Legation protected house</span> and we just said goodbye and I never went back anymore to the <span class="building">Legation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="811">So in my mind, it's still a mystery who were these people that Havier let me talk. </sentence><sentence id="812">Because we spoke German...Hungarian...I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="813">Havier didn't speak Hunearian a word. </sentence><sentence id="814">Mv conversation was with Havier onlv in I mv sood German and his  0 belongings. </sentence><sentence id="815">Can you bring that eventually? </sentence><sentence id="816">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="817">He did bring it to the protected <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="818">Not immediately, but after a few days where we had the two or three <span class="spatial object">pillows</span> in there, so we had some warm...warmer clothing and some pots and pans. </sentence><sentence id="819">But at that time, if] remember correctly, in the <span class="building">building</span> there were no gas, no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="820">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="821">So the people there had to cook. </sentence><sentence id="822">And my mother had two big bags of flour...I remember that...in the <span class="spatial object">basket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">Like this. </sentence><sentence id="824">And she didn't...we couldn't eat anything else. </sentence><sentence id="825">My brother and my...we didn't eat anything else during all the time until well after...even when the Russian came in...only snow water was...this was heavy snow...brought in at night from the <span class="dlf">street</span> by others too in the <span class="building">building</span>, which was made a little fire into the <span

know how they got it...some <span class="env feature">branches</span> because the <span class="env feature">trees</span> and the <span class="env feature">branches</span> were all empty. </sentence><sentence id="827">No <span class="env feature">leaves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="828">So they brought that in and we made fire on it. </sentence><sentence id="829">And my mother, in one of the <span class="spatial object">pots</span> of snow water, made...we called it, very funny now when that it comes to mind, we called it ___ because it was flat like a pancake, but it was just flour and water. </sentence><sentence id="830">And it was delicious. </sentence><sentence id="831">That's what we eat. </sentence><sentence id="832">That was our staple. </sentence><sentence id="833">Well, we didn't do anything in the <span class="building">building</span>, really. </sentence><sentence id="834">People stuck together if they could. </sentence><sentence id="835">They were bombing in the <span class="building">house</span>...outside in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and afraid who comes to pick us up because there were a million rumors. </sentence><sentence id="836">Because, you know, you heard all the time, the shootings and the bombings and the time to the <span class="building">Spanish protected house</span>, in the <span class="region">Margaret

but we seen it through the <span class="dlf">window</span> and the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were all blown in, so there was no <span class="dlf">windows</span> in the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1033">A: That was what is interesting what you asking me because, curiously enough, after that period of time that the Hungarians cleared the way, these Nazis and the Spanish, everybody cleared it away, the misery was there in the <span class="building">house</span> because we didn't know that nobody else will bother us, but I don't recall in my mind, thinking about this million times, that anybody from the Hungarian Nazis, or the Germans or anybody or no Spaniards, nobody came to that <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1034">We were on our own. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I only know that there was a heavy shooting, bombing, all this December what I heard...if this was the beginning of December because I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1036">I don't recall that until the that <span class="populated place">anvbodv</span> was buesoine the <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1037">T don't remember that  3 of November. </sentence><sentence id="1038">This was sometimes in the first week or first 10 days of December when this happened and I was confirmed this with Mr. George Perlasca because I think I am one of really the people who are here this gathering who had at least their mind because of my age. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I really believe that. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Because I don't know whether the other remembers in other <span class="building">buildings</span> how it was. </sentence><sentence id="1041">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1042">But apparently it happened to others. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I only know from other friends and later other people conversing that in other <span class="building">building</span>...not...not only Spanish, Swedish...the same thing happened, that the Hungarians were there and took them and some of them, took them and shoved them into the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1044">I know that historically. </sentence><sentence id="1045">I know that it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So while we were saved by the Spanish...that particular morning was saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="1047">This is really the crucial day because it was crucial that they gave us the <span class="spatial object">Shutz pass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was crucial to me that I was lucky to meet my old professor who says, "Go to the...with me," because otherwise I wouldn't...my faintest mind wouldn't set on the <span class="dlf">Spanish Legation</span> because I heard Swedish and Swiss...uh...Swiss...because you hear always a little more. </sentence><sentence id="1049">We knew about...already in that time, we knew exactly <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1050">We know exactly what's happening outside, but we didn't...I didn't know Spanish Legation, so this was really...they were our saviors. </sentence><sentence id="1051">No question about it. </sentence><sentence id="1052">My life and my mothers and my brothers, definitely! </sentence></p></dialogue>
