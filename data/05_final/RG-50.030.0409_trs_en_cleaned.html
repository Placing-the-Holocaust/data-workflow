<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: George Masse was there, my decision to go to <span class="region">Wisconsin</span> was dictated in part by the desire to get away, and in part by the strength of the <span class="building">history department</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="51">And I worked with a scholar on the Nazi regime, and particularly, the particular interest in the SS, Robert Kale. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: [had wanted to stay at <span class="region">Wisconsin</span>, but at the time my professor, Professor Kale was going through a difficult personal time, and he -- as it turned out wisely for me, said that he was not going to take on any new students at this time and advised that -- advised strongly that I should go to <span class="country">Columbia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">At <span class="populated place">Columbia</span> I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east European scholar, but had excellent contacts in the former <span class="country">countries</span> of the hap -- the former <span class="country">countries</span> that made up the old Hapsburg monarchy. </sentence><sentence id="96">And between the <span class="building">Columbia University</span> name and Dayak's contacts, it eventually opened up some <span class="dlf">doors</span> in central and <span class="region">eastern Europe</span> that might not have been opened had I stayed at <span class="region">Wisconsin</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="116">Was there any -- besides the intellectual connection, and -- and the interest starting from Shirer's book, was there a personal connection in your family to World War II and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: No, no, this was -- this was purely coming at it through history, and -- and frankly through military history. </sentence><sentence id="118">My family had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices, and fled to the <span class="region">New World</span> at the beginning of this century. </sentence><sentence id="119">So with rare exceptions, particularly some cousins in <span class="country">Romania</span>, who managed to survive the war in <span class="country">Romania</span>, most of the family was over in the <span class="country">United States</span> before World War I. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Oh, I see. </sentence><sentence id="121">So when -- you graduated <span class="country">Columbia</span> when?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Le -- let me ask you a question a bit about <span class="building">graduate school</span>, just t -- t-to know what the texture was at the -- at the time. </sentence><sentence id="151">Were there a lot of people studying World War IL, and the Nazis and the -- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi regime, or were you an oddity at the time at <span class="populated place">Columbia</span>? </sentence><sentence id="152">I mean, what -- what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: <span class="populated place">Columbia</span> didn't have at that time, a specific World War II scholar. </sentence><sentence id="157">It did have a strong <span class="building">eastern European department</span>, but its modern -- its eastern European modernist, Voytek Mastney, who was my professor my first year at <span class="populated place">Columbia</span> didn't get tenure and had to leave at the end of 1972 - 1973. </sentence><sentence id="158">He went on to post-war studies in Communism. </sentence><sentence id="159">And that was the focus at <span class="building">Columbia University</span>, but that doesn't mean that there weren't -- there wasn't a generation of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="160">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="161"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection scholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and not the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance. </sentence><sentence id="162">But there were a group of scholars who had been spawned and encouraged by the availability of captured German records on microfilm at the <span class="building">national archives</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">They were first available in an easy to use format on the <span class="spatial object">microfilm</span> in the early 1960's. </sentence><sentence id="164">And this was also the time in which the originals, which had been captured by the U.S. army, were returned to the <span class="country">Federal Republic of Germany</span> in the mid-60's, according to treaty. </sentence><sentence id="165">And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that generation of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime, and interested in the organizations of the Nazi regime, and also fascinated with the personnel files of the individuals, fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick, and how did they operate as individuals and as an organization. </sentence><sentence id="166">And that spawned my interest in the SS, and my interest in doing a biography. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Was -- was <span class="building">Hillberg</span>'s work important to you at that time, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Hillberg's work came out in 1961 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: -- and he was one of the earliest part of that generation. </sentence><sentence id="189">Hillberg had actually worked with the captured German records, analyzed as a document analyst in the late 40's and early 50's, and wrote his book based on that documentation before it was microfilmed, and you can tell that from the citations in his book, he still has the original file folder numbers there. </sentence><sentence id="190">And his book first came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to get serious when I started <span class="building">college</span> in "68, a paperback version was out, and easily available even to a poor graduate student. </sentence><sentence id="191">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="192">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="193"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

make a judgment. </sentence><sentence id="1607">For instance, if the expert sees a month's worth of guard rotation assignments at a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, that expert can talk about those rotations, because he's seen enough evidence to convince him of how -- or -- or to define for him what the daily routine was like. </sentence><sentence id="1608">If there's no evidence, he can speak about -- if there's no evidence -- well, let me -- let me retract that. </sentence><sentence id="1609">If there's -- if we don't have the daily rotations, but only have evidence of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> within the system, then the expert, if he feels so comfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the concentration <span class="dlf">camp system</span>, and how in his expert opinion there's no reason to assume that for this particular <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, it went any way differently. </sentence><sentence id="1610">He cannot -- or I wouldn't, as an expert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what the specific places of rotation were. </sentence><sentence id="1611">That you'd have to do on the basis of the evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1612">You can't know that if you don't have the -- i-if -- if there's a <span class="dlf">gap</span> in that documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And for instance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn't have that documentation for <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1614">We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular functions for security officers in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And the expert testified as to that. </sentence><sentence id="1616">We did have rotation rosters for the guards at <span class="populated place">Sachsenburg</span>, where Schellong was at before he went to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And there the expert could talk very specifically that Conrad Schellong, on such and such a day, was outside the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1618">Or that he checked in on the <span class="building">bunker</span> as security officer every three or four hours, whatever the -- the case might have been. </sentence><sentence id="1619">For instance in the Hajda case, we could talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the <span class="populated

who after the war testified in <span class="region">western countries</span>, where there was -- where you didn't have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been there, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as the information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the testimony in the western protocols. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And through a s -- a combination of those three types of sources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the <span class="populated place">Treblinka labor camp</span> between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were. </sentence><sentence id="1623">We were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and were no longer on the other roster. </sentence><sentence id="1624">One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we had documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> one. </sentence><sentence id="1625">A post-war testimony in a German proceeding, a west

being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And so the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at <span class="populated
