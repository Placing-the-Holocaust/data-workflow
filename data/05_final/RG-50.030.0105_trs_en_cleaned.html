<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born on May 8th, 1924 in the most southern western part of <span class="country">Poland</span> in a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Beilitz</span> in German and <span class="populated place">Bielsko</span> in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="12">It went by both names and it was in the province of <span class="populated place">Salasia</span> (ph) at the foothill of the <span class="env feature">mountain range</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13"> place called <span class="populated place">Krinitza</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="14">Uh I even remember my my very first uh incident which inspired a great deal of fear. </sentence><sentence id="15">My mother and I went to a <span class="spatial object">concert</span> and I remember the setting quite vividly. </sentence><sentence id="16">Uh there were flowers around. </sentence><sentence id="17">I'm not very musical but uh that summer something caught on that day and I remember uh the crowd of people sitting there and and flowers and it was very warm, uh a day of...you know, one of the golden days of of summer, as I see it now, and suddenly a young man came running up to the <span class="spatial object">podium</span> and he pushed the conductor aside and he said, how can you all sit here listening to music when danger is coming from there, and he pointed to to the ___ which separated us from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> which already had been occupied by the Nazis and and he said monsters are coming from there. </sentence><sentence id="18">Why don't you go <span class="building">home</span> and take up arms and join...I remember moving closer to my mother and and saying shouldn't we go <span class="building">home</span> and uh but pretty soon police came and uh arrested the man because he was an agitator for disturbing the peace. </sentence><sentence id="19">I I I still remember that that sudden fear. </sentence><sentence id="20">That that really was my my first memory of uh of something impending but we stayed perhaps another week. </sentence><sentence id="21">I don't remember exactly how long. </sentence><sentence id="22">However, on our way <span class="building">home</span> we saw at <span class="building">stations</span> an awful lot of <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> which was labeled <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">Apparently people were going to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and when we came <span class="building">home</span> uh my father had his arm in a sling and my mother naturally was terribly concerned and uh apparently he had suffered a slight heart attack and uh unfortunately and since things were moving very fast, uh that must have been perhaps the third week in August...that we received a telegram from my uncle in <span class="country">Turkey</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">My mother had a brother...my mother only had one brother and he lived in <span class="country">Turkey</span> and uh he sent us a telegram saying that we should get out, that we had visas which were in the <span class="building">Embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, but my mother said uh we're not going to tell Poppa about the telegram. </sentence><sentence id="25">Poppa is ill (ph) and he should not be disturbed. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I guess that my family, and I only  know, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should suddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous decision. </sentence><sentence id="27">I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on, and I went <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and uh the ring of the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>...there was no answer. </sentence><sentence id="28">No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it was like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those <span class="building">homes</span> that I remembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer whatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="29">And it was a wonderful Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="30">Everything was cut off. </sentence><sentence id="31">There was...we had no electricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers outside and my parents were sort of joking. </sentence><sentence id="32">My father got dressed and came <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and we were all sitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day. </sentence><sentence id="33">And then in the evening they start with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back he he had a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the <span class="dlf">rooftops</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">The Germans were coming but we went to the <span class="interior space">basement</span> with some other people, you know, and it was morning. </sentence><sentence id="35">Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember most vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come. </sentence><sentence id="36">She had prepared some breakfast and we came <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and we sat down. </sentence><sentence id="37">Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the roar of <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span> and it was the <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span> with Nazis in it, two...one in the side <span class="spatial object">car</span> and on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just taken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his hand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="38">And I remember everybody just sat there totally stunned and then we heard people uh running. </sentence><sentence id="39">There were more more <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and more <span class="spatial object">motorcycles</span> were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw from from the <span class="building">house</span> across the <span class="dlf">street</span> the black swastika flag and I think that was the most enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our friends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know, you can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the things uh it sort of changed suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="40">I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of the <span class="spatial object">fireplace</span> and uh it went on the <span class="spatial object">carpet</span> and the <span class="spatial object">carpet</span> was sort of smoldering and and no one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset my mother was and no one paid any attention. </sentence><sentence id="41">These were just tiny little vignettes which suddenly sort of you know changed everything. </sentence><sentence id="42">And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you know, then more and more <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more hoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and I I saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white roses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for and the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother  things happened that afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="43">Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she blessedly is alive and she lives in <span class="country">Israel</span>...her name is Esther Bergman (ph). </sentence><sentence id="44">Her mother came and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill but she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> because they had rounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the <span class="building">temple</span> and they set the <span class="building">temple</span> aflame and then she sort of went out by the <span class="dlf">back door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">And I think that was truly the first impact what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: What happened over the next few days? </sentence><sentence id="83">How did uh things 2  change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men between I think sixteen and fifty had to register. </sentence><sentence id="87">My father at that point was about fifty and since he was ill he did not have to register for a <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">My brother was nineteen and, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that <span class="country">England</span> and <span class="country">France</span> declared war, you know, that we knew right away. </sentence><sentence id="89">That happened Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="90">You know, we were occupied Sunday morning. </sentence><sentence id="91">Sunday afternoon uh <span class="country">England</span> and and <span class="country">France</span> declared war on <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her <span class="interior space">apartment</span> occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="93">David was about my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they were going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of <span class="building">labor battalion</span> to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war. </sentence><sentence id="94">The date was the 19th of October on which my brother left. </sentence><sentence id="95">Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused to make his <span class="spatial object">bed</span> for for months. </sentence><sentence id="96">She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="97">We didn't hear from my brother for a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he was uh blessedly in the <span class="region">Russian occupied zone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">He was in . </sentence><sentence id="99">And what apparently happened was that uh they were brought into the interior of <span class="country">Poland</span> uh near the _....I don't know exactly what location...pursued by bullets. </sentence><sentence id="100">Those who were good swimmers swam across. </sentence><sentence id="101">He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , Which was uh  those things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were vegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... [hada __, you know, a nanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and she would go and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful needlewoman. </sentence><sentence id="102">She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through that we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't particularly interested in that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="103">I was more of a tomboy running around with cats and climbing <span class="env feature">trees</span> and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for people. </sentence><sentence id="104">My mother really had a wonderful reputation. </sentence><sentence id="105">You know, she would embroider things on sweaters. </sentence><sentence id="106">She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get candles. </sentence><sentence id="107">We had quite a <span class="building">store</span> of candles because uh we couldn't use the <span class="spatial object">lamp</span> too often because petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration card...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to eat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow and my father would sit and read to us. </sentence><sentence id="108">And really this is how uh my father was wonderful..you see, I went to <span class="building">Polish schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="109">Even so, my first language was German...spoke German at <span class="building">home</span> and when I would come <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span> I would switch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know. </sentence><sentence id="110">I spoke it naturally. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was my first language. </sentence><sentence id="112">So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching me to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and we would let the candle go down. </sentence><sentence id="113">Then we would take take some wax and my mother made uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would knit. </sentence><sentence id="114">We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater. </sentence><sentence id="115">You know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work. </sentence><sentence id="116">We would get uh thirty . </sentence><sentence id="117">Well, it was thirty if you could buy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the <span class="building">black market</span>, so I would say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we would able to buy roughly a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="118">And this is how things went. </sentence><sentence id="119">And then started the things of the , you know. </sentence><sentence id="120">It was uh to be sent away and every so often a  whatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could stay. </sentence><sentence id="121">You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and again I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother seemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would say until the very end, my mother was absolutely a <span class="building">tower</span> of strength. </sentence><sentence id="122">You know, looking back now, my mother was a very young woman at that time. </sentence><sentence id="123">She was she was forty-one when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="124">Of course to me she was an old woman, you know, to a fifteen year old girl, you know. </sentence><sentence id="125">My father was ten years older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="126">So the existence, you know, and worse and thisis___ how we survived. </sentence><sentence id="127">This was three years...1939 through the spring of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="128">The very very spring...it could have been March perhaps when the order came that we had to move to the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> which was the shabby, remote part of our <span class="populated place">town</span>, quite far away from where we had lived, because it was actually in you see. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh Bielitz- it's called now, two , <span class="populated place">twin cities</span> and that  know. </sentence><sentence id="130">My...as a matter of fact my my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, uh still celebrated Kaiser Franz Joseph, that's the Austrian Kaiser, uh birthday which is on the 18th of August which I still remember, you know and because uh and I think they all talked about the good old days, you know, the wars and you know, everybody has to think the good old days, but my father's family uh came from a place called and was the seat of the which was he was very well know. </sentence><sentence id="131">As a matter of  amongst them. ( </sentence><sentence id="132">Pause) We went to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">My father stood in the...it was just dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="134">He wore the yellow star.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="197">And then the order that my father's leaving. </sentence><sentence id="198">There is however one thing that I would like to mention as a tribute to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh the last night before my father left...of course we all lived in one large <span class="interior space">room</span> at that point...I heard my parents talking. </sentence><sentence id="200">I don't know if it was for them or for my benefit. </sentence><sentence id="201">They did not mention at all the parting in the morning, but they spoke about their years together. </sentence><sentence id="202">They were, you know, about about the happiness they had shared, about uh my brother's birth and mine, about the hopes they had for us, and I think in in death they have instilled something in me which which has been my legacy all this...uh the value of of the love, of the commitment, of the of the family, and uh you know, when the going goes rough as it was in in  0 uh watching by a <span class="building">shop</span> which sold fabrics and uh remembering the type of fabric that my mother bought for a summer dress, but it wasn't colorfast. </sentence><sentence id="203">You know, it was such a...and yet it's very funny. </sentence><sentence id="204">I remember it in . [ </sentence><sentence id="205">remember them now you know. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh seeing some neighbor peering from behind the <span class="dlf">curtain</span>, because you see we went in from from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, through through the <span class="populated place">town</span> again to the other side of the <span class="populated place">town</span> to which was called the where we went. </sentence><sentence id="207">Uh I marched with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="208">I saw a man with a cane. </sentence><sentence id="209">He asked me how old I was. </sentence><sentence id="210">I said eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="211">He told me to go to the left. </sentence><sentence id="212">We were loaded on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> sometime later and I would like to get this over with as fast as I can, OK? </sentence><sentence id="213">And I heard my mother's voice...I did. </sentence><sentence id="214">And she was calling be strong, . </sentence><sentence id="215">And I heard that. </sentence><sentence id="216">I was in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">I jumped off and I said I want to go to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="218">The little man in a raincoat came by. </sentence><sentence id="219">Hisname was__. </sentence><sentence id="220">He was from . </sentence><sentence id="221">I don't know how he had this enormous strength. </sentence><sentence id="222">He was quite short. </sentence><sentence id="223">it was raining. </sentence><sentence id="224">He was wearing a raincoat and a hat. </sentence><sentence id="225">And he took me bodily and he threw me back on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and he said you are too young to die. </sentence><sentence id="226">So it was the man who probably sent my mother to her death decided I should not run back to her. </sentence><sentence id="227">We went to a place called . </sentence><sentence id="228">There was a ___ lager. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was <span class="populated place">transient camp</span> and there was the 29th of June, 1942, a Monday. </sentence><sentence id="230">A long story _. </sentence><sentence id="231">I'll just confine it to my own....] had the opportunity of leaving there, cause of ____, you know, a boy who liked me. </sentence><sentence id="232">His parents tried to get me out of the . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Tell me, tell us a little bit about that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: . ( </sentence><sentence id="274">Sigh) Anyway, in my naivete (ph) I made a decision that I did not want to go out ofthe __ to go back to <span class="populated place">Bielitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">There was...there were two <span class="populated place">camps</span> in <span class="populated place">Beilitz</span> and uh I mean again there's a story about a young man there who apparently liked me very much. </sentence><sentence id="276">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="277">He was a very fine artist and uh his family suggested he __ with his family that you see you could get out ofthe __ if you uh had a place of work, if you had some working permit and uh that you can put, get out to...and uh he had two sisters and they had two <span class="spatial object">sewing machines</span> and they were willing to put one in a <span class="building">shop</span> to secure a place for me, which was an incredible sacrifice. </sentence><sentence id="278">Uh however I knew that if I did that I would probably have to marry __. </sentence><sentence id="279">I made the decision not to go. </sentence><sentence id="280">Uh maybe this is a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even though I knew I was going to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man inthe who came and told me that I was able to go out...his name is Jacob Chancer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="282">He now lives in <span class="populated place">Buffalo</span>, <span class="region">New York</span>, where of course I lived for many years. </sentence><sentence id="283">That decision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs (ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later. </sentence><sentence id="284">And you see uh <span class="populated place">Beilitz</span>, my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, was renown for its textiles. </sentence><sentence id="285">Uh it was called of <span class="region">central Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the place you hail from (ph), and industrialists from all over <span class="country">Germany</span> would come to buy slaves. </sentence><sentence id="287">A man by the name of Keller (ph)...I think it's good to use the names...his name was Director Keller from a <span class="building">firm</span> called 5 had several uh spinning uh weaving and uh  1 always looking because you see that still fairly early. </sentence><sentence id="288">That was "42. </sentence><sentence id="289">They needed German speaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a place called <span class="populated place">Bolkenhein</span> (ph) which was a new <span class="populated place">weaving camp</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="290">And in fact this is where we went. </sentence><sentence id="291">In all  2 she didn't...she won that bet. </sentence><sentence id="292">Anyway we came to <span class="populated place">Bolkenheim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293"><span class="populated place">Bolkenheim</span>...you know uh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing should be said...actually for me it it was easier then. </sentence><sentence id="294">Easier in terms that I didn't see my parents suffer. </sentence><sentence id="295">You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced that my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working. </sentence><sentence id="296">I pushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't worried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="297">And you know, I know if somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it. </sentence><sentence id="298">All the indignities that one has suffered and you know and vice versa, you know. </sentence><sentence id="299">But of course when you're eighteen years old you know, you have the _ that you don't...anyway uh <span class="populated place">Bolkenheim</span> was rough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us. </sentence><sentence id="300">There was somebody there by the name of <span class="building">Meister Zimmer</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="301">He was dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="302">And uh I used to amuse myself when he told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the things, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were designed to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these things we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he would look like when he was dead and things like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="303">Uh now L...I...you know, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like that and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to remove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there. </sentence><sentence id="304">But you know, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do which are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...it's funny...I lapse into  3 Tape #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="340">We are back on tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="346">You were telling me about uh the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and the weaving... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: The weaving...(pause)...we were able to write letters and again in that uh Mrs. Keegler was quite generous because I don't remember exactly, you know, what the ratio was, how often you were permitted to, but of course you know there were...who could you write to, but I was fortunate that I had my father's address in which way my father was allegedly working on the fortification of that <span class="env feature">river</span> and uh I wrote to my father. </sentence><sentence id="350">Uh I did not hear. </sentence><sentence id="351">Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me letters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was, those packages did arrive. </sentence><sentence id="352">Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father and one day a most incredible thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="353">Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and she called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the letter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address. </sentence><sentence id="354">Uh I think that we needn't go into that. </sentence><sentence id="355">No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day and a night. </sentence><sentence id="356">I I could not utter a sound. </sentence><sentence id="357">Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was uh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across is the tremendous support system which existed in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">The love and the friendship and the sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each other. </sentence><sentence id="359">Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced and to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I somehow wish that would filter down. </sentence><sentence id="360">I usually attempt to tell my children and now my grandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know that the legacy of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our people, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity. </sentence><sentence id="361">Uh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually happened in in another <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">I I'll give you the quick progression from <span class="populated place">camp</span> to <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="363">We were in <span class="populated place">Waldenheim</span>, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on <span class="spatial object">looms</span> and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="364">We we had to uh work on uh uh paper. </sentence><sentence id="365">There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the warm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would disintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the  4 and I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...it was called in  5 and he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he said, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly. </sentence><sentence id="366">He said promise that you are never going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="367">I didn't answer him and he took his hand and he turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now. </sentence><sentence id="368">And I promised him. </sentence><sentence id="369">And I remembered it during the working in the <span class="spatial object">coal trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="370">There were <span class="spatial object">trains</span> going by. </sentence><sentence id="371">I didn't know if they were going to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or whatever, and I remember sort of the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very quick. </sentence><sentence id="372">One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there. </sentence><sentence id="373">And at one moment I think I really came fairly close. </sentence><sentence id="374">I felt a very strange pain in my neck. </sentence><sentence id="375">Anyway, obviously I didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="376">So...when things were really very very hard in <span class="populated place">Matzdorf</span> we worked in the <span class="env feature">swamp</span> one days and I think that was really one of my lowest hours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler. </sentence><sentence id="377">She was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing rings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, like a child's <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and she had us pull her around in that <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">She was having a whip about it...I mean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person. </sentence><sentence id="379">And all of a sudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling numbers. </sentence><sentence id="380">You see we all had numbers, of course. </sentence><sentence id="381">And they were calling numbers and I was working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up. </sentence><sentence id="382">I must have been dazed, and she pointed and the <span class="spatial object">lager fuhrer</span> and said you idiots. </sentence><sentence id="383">Don't you even know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number. </sentence><sentence id="384">I didn't understand what she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="385">She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever it was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your own number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't know what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but what happened was as we came to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, there was Director Keller from <span class="populated place">Waldenheim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him. </sentence><sentence id="387">And Yelda fell to her knees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he looked at me and he says I know you. </sentence><sentence id="388">You worked on four <span class="spatial object">looms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">You're coming along. </sentence><sentence id="390">They needed more people for uh working on <span class="spatial object">looms</span> in another <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> (ph) and this is how I got out of <span class="populated place">Matzdorf</span> and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and we went to <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> which was the other, the <span class="populated place">sister camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">Yousee _if they had <span class="dlf">crossbars</span> behind the open <span class="dlf">Landeshutz</span> to <span class="populated place">Matzdorf</span> and one more ____ and when we got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so that was like a homecoming. </sentence><sentence id="392">So this is how...] had one incident with <span class="populated place">Keller</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">He called me into his <span class="building">office</span> once and I just remember this most incredible thing. </sentence><sentence id="394">There was that hugh hugh <span class="interior space">room</span> or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single carpet and a <span class="spatial object">desk</span> on it and he sat alone at the <span class="spatial object">desk</span> and what struck me is that probably in a <span class="interior space">room</span> of that size, fifty of us slept. </sentence><sentence id="395">You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have smuggled out a letter from the <span class="populated place">camp</span> . </sentence><sentence id="396">said I never smuggled a letter. </sentence><sentence id="397">I said I have  6 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: My uncle had...when he found out in what <span class="populated place">camp</span> I was, had written to my, to Keller about me because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of questions. </sentence><sentence id="450">Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they encouraged me to write for more packages. </sentence><sentence id="451">The packages apparently contained chocolate and things which were not obtainable, which I never saw. </sentence><sentence id="452">They said the package must have been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy to write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because apparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I knew my uncle was safe. </sentence><sentence id="453">He was in <span class="country">Turkey</span> but that he knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="454">Anyway getting back to the thing...of course we came to <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> which like heaven by comparison with <span class="populated place">Matzdorf</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">Uh only in <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> we then faced an...another difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="456">And that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only. </sentence><sentence id="457">So you know, we didn't see any light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we worked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you know Frau Keegler was there. </sentence><sentence id="458">Things got worse there because there was very little food but uh she she went on in the same <span class="dlf">vein</span> that she was before, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Tell us a little bit more about <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> and Frau Keegler... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there were not the things which happened in other <span class="populated place">camps</span>, sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or beatings or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="472">Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were covered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="473">Uh she tried to to get vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="474">I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so- called coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it. </sentence><sentence id="475">Uh I remember when this one thing that I always tell young people. </sentence><sentence id="476">Uh you know they knew of the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told us about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that would be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody fasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you know those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this was...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or whatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know, and they really jumped. </sentence><sentence id="477">She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody worked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't falter. </sentence><sentence id="478">And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people reached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday we had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some of the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she would have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="479">On Hanukkah, we knew it was  7 Hanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy celebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="480">We uh made a <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew that you know we couldn't light ____ but we made a <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> out of potatoes and I I still have the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang. </sentence><sentence id="481">I would like to translate it and give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="482">I had a wonder...if I may skip for one minute just to make a happier thing...when I went to <span class="country">Israel</span> for the first time in 1961 I my friends surprised me. </sentence><sentence id="483">I knew of three that were in <span class="country">Israel</span> but actually ten showed up and I was the eleventh, and they got out of the <span class="spatial object">elevator</span> in <span class="populated place">Tel Aviv</span>, singing a song which we had written for the first Hanukkah in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and we carried the <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> which I naturally have now, a beautiful old silver <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> that they give me in memory of the <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> which we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it meant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="484">You can imagine what that <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our grandchild reflected in that...it's truly . </sentence><sentence id="485">Uhso you know, that was possible under Frau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers and you know, under the <span class="spatial object">looms</span> which we worked there was sort of a white powdery substance. </sentence><sentence id="486">We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> under one naked electric light and see the faces in the <span class="spatial object">bunks</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="487">What we did is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and comestothe -- and___ssays oh . </sentence><sentence id="488">That's how how it started out and then we of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters came to listen to us. </sentence><sentence id="489">Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her name is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph). </sentence><sentence id="490">She lives in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="491">Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War. </sentence><sentence id="492">Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who played her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of the past and uh I'll say it in German. </sentence><sentence id="493">The <span class="dlf">exit line</span> on that was uh . </sentence><sentence id="494">Do you understand German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: Translate it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: Uh come and look. </sentence><sentence id="522">I'll show you my newest , you know, what the granddaughter says... , OK. </sentence><sentence id="523">Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and then we see them exiting. </sentence><sentence id="524">Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we say to each other, . </sentence><sentence id="525">Dear children, let us just say that uh humans  8 we were taken early yet, you know, before <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was in its full__ aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to <span class="populated place">working camps</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="526">OK. </sentence><sentence id="527">Briefly uh and finally <span class="populated place">Landeshutz</span> was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter <span class="populated place">camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Gruenberg</span> (ph) in . </sentence><sentence id="528">Uh <span class="populated place">Gruenberg</span> was an enormous <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="529">Uh its <span class="building">factory</span> was one of the most beautiful in <span class="country">Germany</span> in as much that it boasted the most beautiful collection of roses surrounding the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="530">It was direct contradiction of the beauty the ___ was in. </sentence><sentence id="531">Uh I don't remember his name now...we called him LaLouche (ph). </sentence><sentence id="532">I will have to remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="533">That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was director but he was one of the people there. </sentence><sentence id="534">He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he would jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces. </sentence><sentence id="535">He would have sort of a glazed look on his face. </sentence><sentence id="536">I don't know if...I tried to suppress the feeling...we called him Lalouche. </sentence><sentence id="537">He was a beast. </sentence><sentence id="538">Uh things changed very drastically then. </sentence><sentence id="539">I still worked in uh for a very little time in the <span class="building">weaving factories</span>, but pretty soon they had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered sentence of death...spin___...spinning. </sentence><sentence id="540">Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads which came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which came from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">It came to a place called .___ </sentence><sentence id="542">are hugh <span class="spatial object">machines</span> which sort of shred that. </sentence><sentence id="543">Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to our parents. </sentence><sentence id="544">Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when whenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a game. </sentence><sentence id="545">I perfected it. </sentence><sentence id="546">And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being there including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom would always be there. </sentence><sentence id="547">In any event, the most dreaded thing on in <span class="populated place">Gruenberg</span> was that...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go toa <span class="building">doctor's office</span> to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed anything was immediately sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, so you had to leave some life, usually between four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh there was something there with those x-rays. </sentence><sentence id="549">I uh did a thing which I will always regret. </sentence><sentence id="550">Uh the last day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that  9 did, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it. </sentence><sentence id="551">I'm proud to say about our people that nobody gave away the culprit. </sentence><sentence id="552">We all knew who it was, and I think that this is that...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts that people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it sound like it was like a snake <span class="dlf">pit</span> that people __ for survival. </sentence><sentence id="553">Look, I don't know what happened in other <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden name on everything that I have written . </sentence><sentence id="554">| would say that people behaved in the most incredible manner imaginable by and large. </sentence><sentence id="555">And I think that this would be something that cannot be emphasized enough. </sentence><sentence id="556">It was in <span class="populated place">Gruenberg</span> that Yelda once found a raspberry in the <span class="dlf">gutter</span> on the way to the <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="557">She carried it in her pocket all day long and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present. </sentence><sentence id="558">I asked her to take a little bit of a bite and she wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="559">One single raspberry. </sentence><sentence id="560">A total possession. </sentence><sentence id="561">She gave it to a friend. </sentence><sentence id="562">There were other acts like that, many. </sentence><sentence id="563">They unfortunately are not recorded. </sentence><sentence id="564">And I think this is probably the greatest tragedy of them all. </sentence><sentence id="565">The nobility and the love that was felt. </sentence><sentence id="566">Anyway when things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for the Germans, they're probably going to finish us. </sentence><sentence id="567">When things are going good for for them or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go. </sentence><sentence id="568">I know we will forever be slave, you know. </sentence><sentence id="569">It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our obvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going to go to the <span class="building">factory</span> any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was. </sentence><sentence id="570">Uh the night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the <span class="dlf">doors</span> opened. </sentence><sentence id="571">The <span class="populated place">camp</span>, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls. </sentence><sentence id="572">An additional transport of two thousand came from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="573">They told us they had walked for I don't know how long from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and we were going to to go on a march the following morning. </sentence><sentence id="574">Destination later on we heard <span class="building">Orianienberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575"><span class="populated place">Orianienberg</span> was a <span class="populated place">murder camp</span> also, small enough known near <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and we started to march now to to...the death march, 29th of January. </sentence><sentence id="576">I remember I had a terrible cold. </sentence><sentence id="577">I was coughing terribly. </sentence><sentence id="578">Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast. </sentence><sentence id="579">Was Yelda, Suzie and Leisle (ph). </sentence><sentence id="580">Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. </sentence><sentence id="581">She sort of...she moved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, __. </sentence><sentence id="582">She and Suzie were were sort of like sisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together. </sentence><sentence id="583">Lei...Leisle was from from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and Suzie was from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and Yelda and I from  0 started the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this is the last chapter. </sentence><sentence id="584">But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it. </sentence><sentence id="585">And Yelda was to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right. </sentence><sentence id="586">And I'm the only one left. </sentence><sentence id="587">I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. ( </sentence><sentence id="588">Pause) It was unspeakable. </sentence><sentence id="589">I had my skiing boots. </sentence><sentence id="590">I was the best equipped because I had my boots. </sentence><sentence id="591">It...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded. </sentence><sentence id="592">We marched I don't know how many miles a day. </sentence><sentence id="593">We came to rest sometimes in in a <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="594">A lot of...we stopped in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> called __ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped. </sentence><sentence id="595">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="596">Uh people were shot continuously. </sentence><sentence id="597">If somebody stepped out of <span class="dlf">line</span>, then you would see snow being red and there through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, beautifully covered with snow and birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching. </sentence><sentence id="598">Everyday the number got smaller and then we came (sniffling) to a place called <span class="populated place">Flossenberg</span> and in <span class="populated place">Flossenberg</span>, Yelda was already very sick. </sentence><sentence id="599">Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong. </sentence><sentence id="600">One time we had nothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the more you eat, the more thirsty you are. </sentence><sentence id="601">And of course then <span class="dlf">diarhhrea</span> and all was rampant. </sentence><sentence id="602">Uh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us outside. </sentence><sentence id="603">They would spray us with water and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody started to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping fingers)...people died like flies. </sentence><sentence id="604">Then one morning we were told, for example, we were going to leave there. </sentence><sentence id="605">| remember <span class="populated place">Yelda</span> was frantic. </sentence><sentence id="606">She said that's going to be the end. </sentence><sentence id="607">I don't want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="608">And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the open. </sentence><sentence id="609">Maybe we'll have a better chance. </sentence><sentence id="610">And all of a sudden came in an incredible announcement, that President Roosevelt died. </sentence><sentence id="611">Then I knew it was too late to run because you know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies of the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner. </sentence><sentence id="612">It was a horrible blow, horrible. </sentence><sentence id="613">But we found something that day which sort of compensated us a little for that. </sentence><sentence id="614">We found a wrapper of margarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it dry. </sentence><sentence id="615">We thought we'll certainly get very strong. </sentence><sentence id="616">And things got very bad from then on. </sentence><sentence id="617"><span class="populated place">Yelda</span> was really very, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="618">And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep outside and uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little and went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall  1 the <span class="dlf">Wermarcht</span> and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our  2 the sun got up, it was over for her. </sentence><sentence id="619">And we were told to bury the dead of that night. </sentence><sentence id="620">I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="621">It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">I remember the most minute details and places, names of <span class="populated place">cities</span> and <span class="populated place">towns</span> where we went through...I still and I cannot remember the name of the place where she died. </sentence><sentence id="623">I can't. </sentence><sentence id="624">And sometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every <span class="env feature">tree</span> sort of reminds me of her. </sentence><sentence id="625">You know, she's become over the years my my alterego, my __ with my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="626">And every year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible things that happened on the 29th. </sentence><sentence id="627">In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no, forty-five, forty-five years. </sentence><sentence id="628">Forty-nine...from 1945. </sentence><sentence id="629">I didn't see Suzie and Leisle. </sentence><sentence id="630">I didn't know where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't know now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with tremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you know, Hitler is dead. </sentence><sentence id="631">We felt if it was true then either they're going to kill us now or maybe we will survive. </sentence><sentence id="632">It was uh we came to a place in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>...things were really quite crazy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="633">A lot of people were on on the <span class="dlf">roads</span> again and uh soldiers running away and but we were still with the group. </sentence><sentence id="634">We had one woman SS with us and a couple of men. </sentence><sentence id="635">I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously from thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill already, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset about, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a place...oh, a place in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">We were in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> at that point, of course. </sentence><sentence id="637">And and that place was called which I only realized that later. </sentence><sentence id="638">Uh we were sort of  3 overhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb. </sentence><sentence id="639">It was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical Corps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the ____ was there. </sentence><sentence id="640">I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it was a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the <span class="dlf">doors</span> with chains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved. </sentence><sentence id="641">They told that we are going to be killed and I think before that there was some shooting. </sentence><sentence id="642">I remember some shooting was going on like it was here and there. </sentence><sentence id="643">Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh you know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear. </sentence><sentence id="644">Must have been quite ill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I remember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things behind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there. </sentence><sentence id="645">A lot of people were very ill. </sentence><sentence id="646">We knew the Americans were coming. </sentence><sentence id="647">I saw two the night before, and then there was the crazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the biggest irony of them all. </sentence><sentence id="648">They were shooting from <span class="spatial object">planes</span> and Suzie was hit in the foot. </sentence><sentence id="649">Not Suzie, <span class="populated place">Leisle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="650">And she was lying there on the <span class="env feature">straw</span> and I asked her where Suzie was. </sentence><sentence id="651">It was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the <span class="spatial object">pump</span> and I went to look for her and there she was, lying in the <span class="env feature">mud</span> and she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="652">And I didn't want to go back to tell <span class="populated place">Leisle</span> that. </sentence><sentence id="653">So I 1 went out. </sentence><sentence id="654">You see, I had seen...there were two Americans the night before. </sentence><sentence id="655">I spoke to them sort of. </sentence><sentence id="656">But that that is very vague to me. </sentence><sentence id="657">But I remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I couldn't tell <span class="populated place">Leisle</span> so I went outside and I stood sort of in the <span class="dlf">doorway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">It was a brilliant morning. </sentence><sentence id="659">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="660">I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a <span class="dlf">steeple</span> of the <span class="building">church</span> a homemade white flag of peace. </sentence><sentence id="661">And I remember that was the first time I cried in many many months. </sentence><sentence id="662">It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny because now I cry at the slightest provocation. </sentence><sentence id="663">I cry when I see a dog or cat or something like that but didn't cry for many years. </sentence><sentence id="664">And uh and I was standing there and saw and all of a sudden I saw (pause) a strange <span class="spatial object">car</span> coming down the <span class="dlf">hill</span>, no longer green, not bearing the swastika, but a white star. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was sort of a mud-splattered <span class="spatial object">vehicle</span> but I've never seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running towards us and one came toward where I stood. </sentence><sentence id="666">He was wearing battle gear. </sentence><sentence id="667">I have to think...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses and he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English, and I said I speak German. </sentence><sentence id="668">And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know if you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little afraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know. </sentence><sentence id="669">And he didn't answer me for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="670">And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he said, so am I. I was...it was the greatest hour of my life. </sentence><sentence id="671">And then he asked an incredible question. </sentence><sentence id="672">He said, may I see the other ladies? </sentence><sentence id="673">You know, was we have been  4 for me and let me precede him and in that gesture he start me to feel and that young   </sentence></p></dialogue>
