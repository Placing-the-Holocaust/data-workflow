<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Some of them. </sentence><sentence id="222">But most of them not. </sentence><sentence id="223">But they admitted who they are. </sentence><sentence

you're visa you might take five, ten years. </sentence><sentence id="238">Some of my friends had to go to <span class="country">Sweden</span> because it was much faster to get out of <span class="country">Sweden</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span> they say than wait in <span class="country">Poland</span> for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if you're a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="239">And so | organized a <span class="building">student Kibbutz</span> (ph), an <span class="building">academic Kibbutz</span> (ph) of students. </sentence><sentence id="240">And | think in Hebrew they call it <span class="building">Kibbutz acadamime</span> (ph) if | recall correctly, what | was told. </sentence><sentence id="241">| was not

</sentence><sentence id="244">| know the text, what it means, but not word by word. </sentence><sentence id="245">But my wife speaks Hebrew. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="246">And we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a <span class="spatial object">Bree-ha</span> (ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? </sentence><sentence id="247"><span class="populated place">Bree-ha</span> (ph) is a group of young, Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="248">The avant-garde of the <span class="building">Pal-mach</span> (ph), of the Jewish driving force of information of Israeli Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="249">Those are the young people who are politically involved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of whatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to <span class="country">Palestine</span> at that time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="250">There was no <span class="country">Israel</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="251">And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the hostile <span class="country">Poland</span> where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. </sentence><sentence id="252">As a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="253"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="254">It is not the primary

Page 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="257"> matter of fact all my <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> was given to some neighbors and so on. </sentence><sentence id="258">They refused to give me anything, you know? </sentence><sentence id="259">They belonged to us. </sentence><sentence id="260">The fur coats and <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, instead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="261">They did not have to relinquish their status. </sentence><sentence id="262">And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get something back, at least something. </sentence><sentence id="263">Talking about silverware, the <span class="spatial object">candelabra</span> that were a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. </sentence><sentence id="264">All those things perished of course. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="265">They, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it, they had to sell it, some of them. </sentence><sentence id="266">They couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="267">Anyway, it was immaterial anymore to me, | lost more than that. </sentence><sentence id="268">And with this we made a contact with the bra- ha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by <span class="spatial object">train</span> we are going to a little <span class="populated place">town</span> near the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">From there we were met by a group of people, we never really introduced before. </sentence><sentence id="270">They knew about us though. </sentence><sentence id="271">And with their help and their contacts with the <span class="building">border police</span> and so on, they just looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="272">We went right across the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">Don't forget, this was, at that time it was 1946. </sentence><sentence id="274">Still people coming and going to <span class="country">Poland</span>, looking for family. </sentence><sentence id="275">From <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, <span class="country">Austria</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">Looking for some _ survivors, different <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">So the guards at the <span class="dlf">border</span> were not very religious in stopping people. </sentence><sentence id="278">Even if they seen somebody. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was no invasion or so, there was a peaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. </sentence><sentence id="280">But anyway, as a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="281"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="282">It is not the primary source,

class="spatial object">trucks</span> to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">And then over there we were met by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="288">And they were very instrumental. </sentence><sentence id="289">Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="290">First they had contact with the local authorities, also notorious. </sentence><sentence id="291">Don't forget they had a lot of influence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="292">So they were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="293">So for that reason alone probably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. </sentence><sentence id="294">First we got a <span class="building">school</span> to our disposal. </sentence><sentence id="295">We have no <span class="building">home</span> so they give us a whole <span class="building">school</span>, big <span class="interior space">room</span>, and there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and some boys. </sentence><sentence id="296">So we had to divide the one huge <span class="interior space">room</span>, it was like a <span class="building">theater</span> of some kind or an <span class="interior space">auditorium</span>, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like small <span class="interior space">cubicles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">We had the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> over there like <span class="spatial object">military beds</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">And it was very comfortable really. </sentence><sentence id="299">And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student books and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything for us into German. </sentence><sentence id="300">And they, having some contacts at the <span class="building">University</span>, we didn't have to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents were in order, then they segregated us into different <span class="building">facilities</span> and who ever was in medicine, some were first time that they started the <span class="building">University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">|

year. </sentence><sentence id="306">But medicine in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> was seven years so | still had four, five, six, four more years to go. </sentence><sentence id="307">In German, that | never handled. </sentence><sentence id="308">| spoke French. </sentence><sentence id="309">| speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. </sentence><sentence id="310">But | learn it fast. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and exams | passed. </sentence><sentence id="312">Maybe because we were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="313">I'm sure there was some bearing to it, you know? </sentence><sentence id="314">They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as smooth as a transition until they knew, around this new <span class="building">medical school</span>, as they could. </sentence><sentence id="315">Which | was very grateful for. </sentence><sentence id="316">We had no tuition. </sentence><sentence id="317"><span class="building">American Joint</span> provided this. </sentence><sentence id="318">And then we received food, they provide food for us too. </sentence><sentence id="319">So we were like a little <span class="populated place">Kubbutz</span> (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="320">And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new <span class="region">surroundings</span>, new people. </sentence><sentence id="321">We met some friends who were there before us from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">Some of them Viennese Jewish students, one. </sentence><sentence id="323">We were very close. </sentence><sentence id="324">I'm sure we're much closer now than if this would have happened before the war. </sentence><sentence id="325">Because we have something in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody.

</sentence><sentence id="341">We sit at night and talk and talk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="342">And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be fascinated with, but it
