<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite wealthy and our <span class="building">house</span> was always open and they -- more Christians and Aristocrats came to the <span class="building">house</span>, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="150">And also we traveled quite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">My mother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and so we, we went a lot to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and to <span class="country">Austria</span> and to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I wasn't <span class="building">home</span> that much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of. </sentence><sentence id="153">So in "36 I was at the -- in <span class="country">Germany</span> at the Olympic games because my very best friend -- and if you ever read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their guest through the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="154">And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running. </sentence><sentence id="155">Flying, not running. </sentence><sentence id="156">And I was so proud and I screamed for him. </sentence><sentence id="157">And it was a very interesting time in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the Nazism as much as they really were. </sentence><sentence id="158">They didn't like the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="159">They didn't like Jesse Owens because he was black. </sentence><sentence id="160">They didn't like some other people because they were another color, like Japanese, but still it was not bad. </sentence><sentence id="161">And we had a wonderful time and I met a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, "What religion you are?" </sentence><sentence id="162">and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time. </sentence><sentence id="163">Coming back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through part of <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion. </sentence><sentence id="165">"You are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="166">We don't want you." </sentence><sentence id="167">But I managed, and I went to <span class="building">Montessori school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">So because of that I happened to go to <span class="country">Italy</span>, and I really had Madam Montessori" teaching me just before she died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: What was she like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: She was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="193">She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry for today's <span class="building">Montessori schools</span> because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally retarded, to learn to do things by themselves -- to dress by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="194">And today they turned this all out. </sentence><sentence id="195">Today they have <span class="building">Montessori schools</span> where the kids have to be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="196">That is not for our children. </sentence><sentence id="197">The children have to let out. </sentence><sentence id="198">But hers was a natural thing. </sentence><sentence id="199">She didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children. </sentence><sentence id="200">And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="201">And also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to <span class="building">elementary school</span> they are bored. </sentence><sentence id="202">Because in <span class="building">Montessori school</span> most of them already learn how to write, how to count, how to do things. </sentence><sentence id="203">And it makes children very difficult to grow up. </sentence><sentence id="204">But it was a great experience to be in <span class="populated place">Rome</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">I love <span class="populated place">Rome</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">And she lived out in, in a not such a good <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> either, but her whole life was the children and the teaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world. </sentence><sentence id="207">So I do have my Montessori diploma. </sentence><sentence id="208">And then from there I went to <span class="country">England</span> because I wanted to learn the King's English in a real good way and I did. </sentence><sentence id="209">Now, of course, I lost it all. </sentence><sentence id="210">Waited all the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection years where I lived in different <span class="country">countries</span>, it came off. </sentence><sentence id="211">And after <span class="country">England</span>, I came <span class="building">home</span> and that was already "39. </sentence><sentence id="212">And then I decided I wanted to go to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Letters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen for a long time because in a long time in <span class="country">Hungary</span> when you were a girl, who spoke lot of languages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists. </sentence><sentence id="448">And as I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group. </sentence><sentence id="449">And the one Swedish man started to write. </sentence><sentence id="450">He has written for years and years. </sentence><sentence id="451">We were corresponding. </sentence><sentence id="452">I didn't think of anything. </sentence><sentence id="453">I was young and I had a lot of young men around me and all that so I just thought, "How nice. </sentence><sentence id="454">This nice Swedish man never forget This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="455">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="456"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection a young kid. </sentence><sentence id="457">And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then. </sentence><sentence id="458">So in any case one day -- that was very frightening experience -- finally, the bell rang. </sentence><sentence id="459">And I look out and there is a German soldier standing outside. </sentence><sentence id="460">And I look back at my parents. </sentence><sentence id="461">Well, we couldn't not open the <span class="dlf">door</span>, but then I looked again. </sentence><sentence id="462">I said, "Oh, my God, I know him." </sentence><sentence id="463">When I was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of the soldiers coming to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">And my name evidently didn't mean a thing -- that a Mandl could be German. </sentence><sentence id="465">He didn't think I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="466">And I said to my parents, "What shall I do?" </sentence><sentence id="467">He said, "Well, you have to open the <span class="dlf">door</span>." </sentence><sentence id="468">He didn't want to come in, thank God. </sentence><sentence id="469">He just said would I show him <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>?

and we write the letter. </sentence><sentence id="858">So that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="859">I felt first very bad and, you know, conscious that I am just leaving my parents. </sentence><sentence id="860">But we are young, and I wanted so badly to live. </sentence><sentence id="861">And it was really a terrible thing maybe, but I just -- I wanted to stay.

</sentence><sentence id="868">But eventually the Germans were after him and so they gave him a new name like Swenson and a new lookout and they put him somewhere else and he left. </sentence><sentence id="869">But there was another wonderful young woman with two little boys and she was German, married to a Swede, and she got stuck with the children in <span class="country">Hungary</span>.

out there were other people. </sentence><sentence id="874">But three weeks I was there, and in the three weeks the big bombing started. </sentence><sentence id="875">And they really started and they were day and night, and the German artillery was right above us and we could see whole <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="876">We were in the <span

nothing. </sentence><sentence id="880">My dear friend arrived back with his <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span> and demanded my return immediately. </sentence><sentence id="881">And the

</sentence><sentence id="886">They bombed the <span class="building">headquarters</span>, but the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Christian -- from the <span class="building">Christian houses</span> like where we were on with my parents, that became a <span class="building">Christian house</span>, so my parents had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="887">And thank God, my grandmother had a big <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where my -- my grandmother wasn't alive, but my aunt was there and her

</sentence><sentence id="889">And that <span class="building">house</span> became a <span class="building">Jewish house</span> and he said, "I have to come back because the Arrow Cross comes every day and reading the list of people in that <span class="building">house</span> and if I am not there, and my name is still on, then they would kill my parents." </sentence><sentence id="890">So they had a little argument and the Minister said, "No, because we are responsible." </sentence><sentence id="891">And he said, "Well, she's responsible for her parents." </sentence><sentence id="892">I just spoke I said, "I'm going <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="893">So then they said, "Not with him." </sentence><sentence id="894">I should go down in the <span

went down with the promise that everyday when they allow us out -- we were allowed one hour a day to go out shopping or whatever -- that I call and, thank God, the <span class="spatial

felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three weeks of <span class="dlf">heaven</span>, but I can't blame them. </sentence><sentence id="902">I mean, maybe I shouldn't have done

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: With, with a soldier and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And Raoul -- it was already no light, we had only candlelights -- and Raoul opened the <span class="dlf">windows</span> and it was the whole <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> was burning. </sentence><sentence id="1356">And he said, "Eichmann, look out. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Look what you're doing?" </sentence><sentence id="1358">And Eichmann said, "They deserve it." </sentence><sentence id="1359">He said, "Stop talking and stop killing the

</sentence><sentence id="1365">And then Eichmann left. </sentence><sentence id="1366">But he had to have his say and he had to show it to him, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I wish he would be there when Eichmann had to be hanged or whatever they did to him. </sentence><sentence id="1368">Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1369">So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile -- I was just hostessing, you know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass!* </sentence><sentence id="1370">what was also his design. </sentence><sentence id="1371">He designed -- first, he went to the Hungarian and said, "Are there still <span class="spatial object">trains</span> going between here and <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I'd like to take the Jews off your hand," he said. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And they said, "Yes, Mr. Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1374">You can take 5,000 people." </sentence><sentence id="1375">So he came back to the <span class="building">Embassy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1376">He says, "5,000 and they will never allow me another one." </sentence><sentence id="1377">So that's no good. </sentence><sentence id="1378">So then he designed this Schutz-pass. </sentence><sentence id="1379">And, of course, with 350 people we had millions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the Minister sat and signed each of them. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Now I am afraid you will hear many times they said they were fake papers. </sentence><sentence id="1381">Not one of them were ever fake. </sentence><sentence id="1382">If they say it was too many, yes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably made 50,000 of it. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Alright? </sentence><sentence id="1384">But they were not fake because everyone of them is signed by the Swedish Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1385">What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three years <span class="interior space">Underground</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> and he had a little <span class="spatial object">printing machine</span> and he figured he will come to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and see what he can help there. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And there he had Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed "Danielsson" and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 some people found it. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry. </sentence><sentence id="1389">He said, "You can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="1390">But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, "But if you can save one single life, go ahead and do it." </sentence><sentence id="1391">So very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like Raoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one. </sentence><sentence id="1392">But it was not Raoul's papers. </sentence><sentence id="1393">They were not fake, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And these people just don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1395">He did. </sentence><sentence id="1396">Also, they say he gave us passports. </sentence><sentence id="1397">He never gave passports. </sentence><sentence id="1398">It was a pass, and the pass and if you will read my book, you will see it. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I have it translated. </sentence><sentence id="1400">The picture of the person is on there, with the signature, and it says, "The above, the bearer of this paper is protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings." </sentence><sentence id="1401">And if and when we collectively can go to <span class="country">Sweden</span>, then they will be going and then in <span class="country">Sweden</span> in 14 days this paper will be invalid. </sentence><sentence id="1402">It doesn't say anywhere it's a <span class="spatial object">passport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1403">It doesn't say anywhere that he can take his star off. </sentence><sentence id="1404">It just says he's protected by the Swedish government. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And then when these people had to be shifted out of their <span class="building">houses</span>, then Raoul just picked them up and in these 60 <span class="building">houses</span> we put them in. </sentence><sentence id="1406">These were our <span class="building">safe houses</span> and it was not comfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Raoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to go in the meantime on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Now, on the <span class="dlf">road</span> he didn't take us girls. </sentence><sentence id="1409">He took the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> and he took some of the diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And by that time he called up the Swiss diplomat and said, "Help me. </sentence><sentence id="1411">We need some help. </sentence><sentence id="1412">We need you people doing this." </sentence><sentence id="1413">So then we got the Swiss involved. </sentence><sentence id="1414">We got the Portuguese involved. </sentence><sentence id="1415">We got the <span class="building">Papal Nuncio</span> involved very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And so he had enough men to go with him including Thomas Veres, who was always with him. </sentence><sentence id="1417">He was a young boy with a <span class="spatial object">camera</span> hidden and he made all these pictures. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because they were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul and he would shout, "Raoul, jump. </sentence><sentence id="1419">They're killing you." </sentence><sentence id="1420">And Raoul jumped into the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and they left. </sentence><sentence id="1421">But he went out after the people all the way to the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span> to get the people back. </sentence><sentence id="1422">With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="1423">As I said, it was the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know -- and you said, you've never been in <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1532">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1533">I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1534">But one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book and on the way to the <span class="building">railway station</span>, he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German. </sentence><sentence id="1535">He spoke perfect German. " </sentence><sentence id="1536">How dare you are taking our people. </sentence><sentence id="1537">They're all our protected people. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And all of those people, who have my papers turn around." </sentence><sentence id="1539">And one of my very good girlfriends from here now, she said, "Well, what can happen? </sentence><sentence id="1540">They'll kill her anyhow." </sentence><sentence id="1541">She turned around. </sentence><sentence id="1542">She didn't have any paper -- and her sister and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And "Get on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1544">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1545">And then he started to open his black book and started to read names like a machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And people caught on, those who could still walk and they walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand people back to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> to these safe <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1547">And on the way <span class="building">home</span>, Per Anger said to him, "Raoul, I didn't know we have a black book and you have names? </sentence><sentence id="1548">When did you do that?" </sentence><sentence id="1549">And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, "I'll show it to you when I done it." </sentence><sentence id="1550">And he opens it up and not one single name. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Nothing! </sentence><sentence id="1552">But that was his idea. </sentence><sentence id="1553">He had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="1554">He had to save people. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And the same thing, he had drivers licenses and insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't read. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And he took it all the way to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and he demanded to open the <span class="dlf">doors</span> and he yelled to the people, "I have your papers here. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Get out, Mr. So and So." </sentence><sentence id="1558">And there to some people, you know, "Aw, maybe we can get away." </sentence><sentence id="1559">And he handed them -- some of them got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And insurance papers and tax papers. </sentence><sentence id="1561">You name it. </sentence><sentence id="1562">He brought them back. </sentence><sentence id="1563">But I don't know if you saw the film. </sentence><sentence id="1564">There was one and that was the truth that he took <span class="building">home</span> thousands and in the meantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1565">He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but he didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1566">He just wanted the people. </sentence><sentence id="1567">Once he was about 250 young men was taken and they were told that they will clean up <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> from the bombing and he knew exactly that's not true. </sentence><sentence id="1568">So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and again a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said, "Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot." </sentence><sentence id="1569">And Raoul looks at him and said, "That's fine. </sentence><sentence id="1570">You can kill him." </sentence><sentence id="1571">And from the 250, 249 already down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Was a doctor, and he is in this <span class="country">country</span> today. </sentence><sentence id="1573">And Raoul understand immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1574">He had no idea what the man's name is and he says, "Johnny, you left your paper at my <span class="spatial object">desk</span> again." </sentence><sentence id="1575">And he handed him a paper and off they went. </sentence><sentence id="1576">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1577">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1578"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 Yeah? </sentence><sentence id="1579">But he always -- he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that anyone can do. </sentence><sentence id="1580">Now we had this <span class="building">hospital</span> already. </sentence><sentence id="1581">And also it was full of patients and also full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1582">It was already a very, very snowy day in the beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing what I could never learn. </sentence><sentence id="1583">He remembered names, and once he had your name he would never forget. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I forget it in five minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1585">He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and somebody else Aggie. </sentence><sentence id="1586">He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava. </sentence><sentence id="1587">No mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="1588">So what he wanted to do -- the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had <span class="building">offices</span> in every section of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's name to be sure that he gets the right people. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And he never forgot those names, and he knew which one in which <span class="region">section</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1591">One day he comes to the <span class="building">hospital</span> in this horrible snow and he was unshaven and probably hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1592">Who knows where he was, saving people. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks. </sentence><sentence id="1594">I mean punks because they were 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, "Kill." </sentence><sentence id="1595">If you tell that to a 12 year old, "Kill, then you won't get punished for it." </sentence><sentence id="1596">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="1597">So here they stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul --I was there, it so happened on that day -- and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit these three kids. </sentence><sentence id="1598">I've never seen anybody hitting so strong. </sentence><sentence id="1599">Then he doesn't speak Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and half Hungarian, "Get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1601">You are in a <span class="region">Swedish territory</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1602">And, of course, the <span class="spatial object">guns</span> fell to the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1603">So we had three guns in no time. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And he said, "Get your officers in here." </sentence><sentence id="1605">These three boys ran out. </sentence><sentence id="1606">I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened because he was just powerful. </sentence><sentence id="1607">In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and they all spoke some German. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his watch and says, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?" </sentence><sentence id="1609">And the guy looks up and says, "How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?" </sentence><sentence id="1610">He knew. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And Raoul pushed up his shoulders and he said, "I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble." </sentence><sentence id="1612">He says, "I am not in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1613">You are." </sentence><sentence id="1614">He says, "No, you are because by mistake you killed a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you." " </sentence><sentence id="1615">No, I never killed anyone." " </sentence><sentence id="1616">Yes, you did. </sentence><sentence id="1617">He died here in our <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And before he died, he asked us to call the <span class="building">headquarters</span> and your name is up at the <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1619">They're killing you. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So get out and bring me what I ask you. </sentence><sentence id="1621">Medication! </sentence><sentence id="1622">And maybe I will help you." </sentence><sentence id="1623">Without a word the guy ran out. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing. </sentence><sentence id="1625">He says, "Raoul, what the hell did you just do?" </sentence><sentence id="1626">And Raoul says, "Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Nothing." </sentence><sentence id="1628">He said, "How did you know it was Simon." </sentence><sentence id="1629">He said, "I didn't know he was Simon, but that's the name of the officer there and we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1630">It was Simon." </sentence><sentence id="1631">And then the doctor looked at him again and he says, "Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying." </sentence><sentence id="1632">He said, "Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been." </sentence><sentence id="1633">You see, now that was the way he saved. </sentence><sentence id="1634">It could have been a trouble for him at all times. </sentence><sentence id="1635">He did the same thing when he saved 70,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1636">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1637">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1638"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 We had a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1639">A real <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And that was just about on the end when the Russians were already outside the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> and Eichmann laughed many times, "Kill everybody," and they put up the guns. </sentence><sentence id="1641">Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who wanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one of them came to him one day and he said, "Go immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1642">Eichmann put up the bombs, and they're going to kill the 70,000 people." </sentence><sentence id="1643">And Raoul says very quietly, "Oh, gosh and just our two <span class="building">Red Cross</span> girls are in there delivering medicine and food." </sentence><sentence id="1644">He says, "Get back to your <span class="building">headquarters</span> and tell them that the Germans called off the killing." </sentence><sentence id="1645">And now it's not like in the film. </sentence><sentence id="1646">In the film, he went himself to them. </sentence><sentence id="1647">But it's not so. </sentence><sentence id="1648">We were all in the <span class="building">office</span> and like a little child he says, "Now, listen to what I'm going to do." </sentence><sentence id="1649">He picks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the <span class="building">headquarters</span>, and he said, "This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph)." </sentence><sentence id="1650">Okay?

" </sentence><sentence id="1682">Yeah." " </sentence><sentence id="1683">Get dressed. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Get dressed." " </sentence><sentence id="1685">Where we going?" </sentence><sentence id="1686">He said, "You're going after them and bring them back." </sentence><sentence id="1687">Three or four boys went screaming at the German. </sentence><sentence id="1688">They all spoke German, and they said, "We have to take them to the <span class="building">Headquarters</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="1689">No, we have to take them. </sentence><sentence id="1690">You have phony papers." </sentence><sentence id="1691">And the Germans said, "No, I don't have." " </sentence><sentence id="1692">Yes, that's a phony papers." </sentence><sentence id="1693">Took it from him. " </sentence><sentence id="1694">Turn around. </sentence><sentence id="1695">We go." </sentence><sentence id="1696">So these poor people, they didn't know where they going and then finally, one of these little Hungarian came up to somebody and says, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1697">We are the Wallenberg people." </sentence><sentence id="1698">And they took them all back. </sentence><sentence id="1699">Now we had phony papers. </sentence><sentence id="1700">We had real papers, too. </sentence><sentence id="1701">But you see this -- you have to do everything so  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 fast. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Now, it was not always easy. </sentence><sentence id="1703">His big, big heartbreak was when he had an <span class="building">orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1704">He had two <span class="building">orphanages</span> but in the one, we had 79 children. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And, of course, Raoul visits there bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal noises and telling them stories just to calm them down. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And the kids were talking, laughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And he visited them as much as he could. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Not every day because he had to go out to the <span class="dlf">Austrian border</span> and who knows where. </sentence><sentence id="1709">But he came to the children as much as he could, always with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy. </sentence><sentence id="1710">He was a clown without the nose and everything, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And one day he arrived and found the children all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1712">We found out from the guard -- was a young boy, who was also shot, but thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="1713">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Young, young, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1715">One little boy went under a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother was dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and said to him, "Whenever you get in trouble, get under a <span class="spatial object">chair</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1716">And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting, they didn't even look under the <span class="spatial object">chair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Just kill the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And one more was saved, because she had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1719">So those two kids were saved. </sentence><sentence id="1720">The rest of it were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1721">They just killed them for fun!And this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying, bitterly crying. </sentence><sentence id="1722">For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children, that was more than he could take. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like seven foot tall, and said, "We're not going to stop fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1724">I want to save this <span class="country">nation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I want the children to make peace in this world." </sentence><sentence id="1726">And he went on fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And it must have hurt him so badly. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite that wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever. </sentence><sentence id="1729">Twice she was saved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in <span class="building">Mercer College</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1730">She's teaching humanities and languages. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And you should have her. </sentence><sentence id="1732">I will give you the address after. </sentence><sentence id="1733">She's a marvelous person. </sentence><sentence id="1734">So in any case this was the two people. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And then Raoul was out again, when we heard that they shooting people into the <span class="env feature">Danube River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And it was December, just before Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And what the Hungarians did -- it was no snow -- it was a no stars, only heavy snowing and the <span class="env feature">Danube</span>, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with huge icicles. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will look for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men. </sentence><sentence id="1739">But Eichmann said, "Do it." </sentence><sentence id="1740">So what they did, they roped three people together and then they shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Some of them, I understand, swam out somehow and survived. </sentence><sentence id="1742">But Raoul arrived <span class="building">home</span> the third day to hear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself. " </sentence><sentence id="1743">What will Eichmann do next? </sentence><sentence id="1744">How can they do that to human beings?" </sentence><sentence id="1745">And this was the first time he turned to us and asked, "How many of you can swim?" </sentence><sentence id="1746">I was the only one with three other diplomats, men, who put up my hand. </sentence><sentence id="1747">I said, "I was taught swimming in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1748">Let's go." </sentence><sentence id="1749">I had no idea where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="1750">So we went with our <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> on the other <span class="region">side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1751">We This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1755">We had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the <span class="interior space">cave</span>, and every time we had to synchronize. </sentence><sentence id="1756">When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1757">Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy. </sentence><sentence id="1758">They were afraid they would be caught. </sentence><sentence id="1759">So we -- when they fell we jumped and thanks to the icicles the rope hang on to the <span class="env feature">ice</span>, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them in, changed them. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Fifty people we saved -- what is nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1762">But it's more than if we had no Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1763">We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we couldn't move anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1764">And then that was over and then we had one more big thing. </sentence><sentence id="1765">When they advertised -- the "lovely" Germans -- that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such and such a <span class="building">palace</span> next morning to clean up <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, we knew again that they will take them right out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1766">So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, "You all have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working in the <span class="region">Buda side</span> in a beautiful <span class="building">villa</span> because as I told you we always had to move our <span class="building">offices</span> and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1768">No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1769">But what was so amazing that it was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice, but moonlit. </sentence><sentence id="1770">Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows. </sentence><sentence id="1771">Why they didn't come on that night. </sentence><sentence id="1772">Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1773">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1774">The CIA!(r) must have been very good and the <span class="building">Scotland Yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1775">They didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And suddenly Raoul arrived around midnight. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said, "Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?" </sentence><sentence id="1778">And so we said, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1779">And then he told us quickly a joke. </sentence><sentence id="1780">He said, "I don't want you to look up, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next <span class="building">villa</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1781">And naturally we all looked up. </sentence><sentence id="1782">He says, "Don't look up. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Just work. </sentence><sentence id="1784">It's only the <span class="building">German Headquarters</span>."

killed." </sentence><sentence id="1808">Then like Raoul Wallenberg would say, "Get killed? </sentence><sentence id="1809">No way. </sentence><sentence id="1810">Because the Hungarians and the Germans,

are grandmothers, both of them. </sentence><sentence id="1824">But they lived. </sentence><sentence id="1825">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1826">So it is incredible the things he has done.
