<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Well, one of my most wonderful memories are those days. </sentence><sentence id="84">And one of my saddest memories is that day when Hitler finally came to power. </sentence><sentence id="85">We didn't have <span class="spatial object">televisions</span>, but we had the radios. </sentence><sentence id="86">And everywhere, even in the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, they blared out the Hitler music. </sentence><sentence id="87">And I remember very well my father. </sentence><sentence id="88">He assembled us that same night in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="89">And he said, "Look now, you see what has happened. </sentence><sentence id="90">And I want you to know that in our <span class="building">home</span>, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="91">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="92"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection nothing will change. </sentence><sentence id="93">We will have the same values. </sentence><sentence id="94">We believe the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="95">We will be the same as we always are." </sentence><sentence id="96">But, he said, "We've got to be extremely careful now because we are known." </sentence><sentence id="97">My father was a very known educator in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">And he said, "You must learn to be quiet, not to shout "Heil Hitler", but to be quiet on the outside because this is the only hope we can survive this." </sentence><sentence id="99">And true enough, the next morning several of his SS (ph) men came to our <span class="building">house</span> early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="100">They wish to come early so that they knew you were there. </sentence><sentence id="101">They asked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="102">But my father at that time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a blessing because they couldn't transport him and they would have had all kinds of things to get him out there. </sentence><sentence id="103">And since my father was a rather known man, a rather known educator in <span class="country">Germany</span>, they were a little bit afraid to begin this, to rock the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> too much. </sentence><sentence id="104">So, they left him alone. </sentence><sentence id="105">And I can almost say since and very soon afterwards, he died. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, he was spared. </sentence><sentence id="107">But the very same day after that happened, that the Nazis came to our <span class="building">house</span>, I remember too well my father got us all together -- us four children and a mother. </sentence><sentence id="108">And he said, "Now you see what has happened, what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="109">But in our <span class="building">home</span> everything will be the same. </sentence><sentence id="110">On the contrary, for now on we will be much more together than we ever been before. </sentence><sentence id="111">And I urge you not to be afraid." </sentence><sentence id="112">I remember that today.

At that time he was already so far advanced in his disease that they just let him alone and said, "Well, he's dying anyway. </sentence><sentence id="117">He's gone." </sentence><sentence id="118">So, that was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="119">And I will tell you from there on, we really were about the closest knit family you ever have seen or ever have experienced. </sentence><sentence id="120">Because we lived in our own This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="121">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="122"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="building">collection home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">We had our values as we always had. </sentence><sentence id="124">We could be open with each other. </sentence><sentence id="125">And very soon we got a tiny little <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">You see, many, many years ago, you didn't have all these wonderful <span class="spatial object">television</span> and <span class="spatial object">radios</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">You got a tiny little <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">We never were very interested in <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, but for now on we always start to turn. </sentence><sentence id="129">Do you know what we were looking for?Finally, one day we found it. </sentence><sentence id="130">The <span class="spatial object">radio</span> from <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">That was... </sentence></p></dialogue>

this was very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="1844">Already with age 15, she moved into another <span class="populated place">city</span> because she came from a very small <span class="populated

that time. </sentence><sentence id="1845">Fortunately, she met there the head of that <span class="building">school</span> and fell in love with him. </sentence><sentence id="1846">And that became my father. </sentence><sentence id="1847">So they married. </sentence><sentence id="1848">She never went to the <span class="building">university</span>, which she actually had wanted to do.
