<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: They wanted -- they finally wanted to be accepted. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167">They would still be those old names, which sol -- which kind of suggests the assimilation hadn't happened. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Yeah, it wi-- yeah, the -- unfortunately, I have to say that the German Jews felt very uppity about east European Jews, and the -- and I don't -- the older I get, the less I understand it, because I find out in looking at the family tree, that, for example -- well, that f-- the one thing that complicates everything is that because of all the wars over there, the -- they -- the people changed citizenship any time. </sentence><sentence id="169">I mean, they didn't know who was running what part of the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="170">On my -- on my wife's -- my late wife's family, her name was Frankel, and her paternal family, ther -- her father was born in a place called <span class="populated place">Drohobych</span>, in -- in -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Oh yes, in <span class="country">Poland</span>, isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Well, depends when you're talking about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
