me a couple of years ago, I had a schoolmate who is also of Jewish origin in this <span class="building">elementary school</span>, this <span class="building">schoolmate</span>, uh, came from an assimilated family, , | mean they came probably two or three generations before us. </sentence><sentence id="8">They came from a place in <span class="country">Germany</span> called <span class="populated place">Desow</span> (ph) and the name of the family to this day remains <span class="populated place">Desow</span> (ph) and he told me when we met by chance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was always dressed in brown, for some reason my mother always thought that brown suited me well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious relationship between me and the color brown , | can't stand it, but that is how  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Janisport(ph) when the Germans just marched into neutral <span class="country">Denmark</span> and <span class="country">Denmark</span> had to know that of course they could provide heroes, get heroes had they fought. </sentence><sentence id="9">But they had no political or military power to assist the Danish, the German occupation forces. </sentence><sentence id="10"><span class="building">Demark</span> succumbed, made a deal with the Germans, a deal by the way which is of great significance to our life as Jews because that set us apart from the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, <span class="region">occupied Europe</span>, because the made a deal with the Germans based on a kind of mutual respect, so to say, sharing of, sharing of authority. </sentence><sentence id="11">The Danes(ph) got permission from the Germans to go on with their normal lives. </sentence><sentence id="12">Political parties were non-functioning, the <span class="building">parliament</span> went on giving laws, the government was inside, the King was riding through the <span class="populated place">town</span> followed by a crowd of school children on his horseback and so to say for most days in these years, the first years of the occupation, life was relatively normal, of course we were effected by the war and by the supply situation, but basically the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="13">We had two, we had two free parliamentary elections <span class="country">Denmark</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection distinction between Danish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="14">Meaning that no special anti-Jewish legislation, no interference with Jewish life at the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, the <span class="building">synagogues</span> were operating the <span class="building">schools</span>, were operating the <span class="building">old age homes</span>, whatever you had so the structure of the Jewish community remained untouched by the German occupation until a certain moment of course, which was the famous day of 29th of August 1943. </sentence><sentence id="15">I want to just relate one thing, of course the Jews knew about what was on in Europe, but vaguely, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in September, October the Germans had arrested the majority of the Norwegian Jews, although we were related to the <span class="populated place">community</span>, intermarriage between the <span class="populated place">communities</span> and youthful activities, we didn't know because we kind of lived in empty <span class="interior space">space</span>, we didn't have information. </sentence><sentence id="16">We could hear pbe of course, but pbe didn't know much about the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't know about the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span> for instance, and the allies did not consider this a very important item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as a matter of fact in a fools paradise. </sentence><sentence id="17">Being persuaded to believe that the normal life we lived could continue without end. </sentence><sentence id="18">In the <span class="populated place">Danish community</span>, by the way, was influenced by the Danish patricians, the Danish officials went on telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the Jews this is what you call , this would be cause for war and then we would  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="19">Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, but didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-German agreement. </sentence><sentence id="20">People  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection into the <span class="populated place">community</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="21">But, I still remember, there are some parts in history which you remember vividly where you are standing or sitting with the other guy, like the story with the typing, I remember that I was asked to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="22">I was standing up and he was sitting behind a huge <span class="spatial object">desk</span> with his , his and had a beard like or square, long beard, very well groomed, but you know. </sentence><sentence id="23">They told me that they, he ordered me to give up all this playing around and he said, I remember this today, if you don't give it up, you and others of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of the Jewish community because if the Germans catch you or the Danes catch you revenge might be taken and that might put the whole safety of our <span class="populated place">community</span> in danger. </sentence><sentence id="24">So, give it up. </sentence><sentence id="25">The moment that you have been told that you have the responsibility for a whole <span class="populated place">community</span> and you're only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it up. </sentence><sentence id="26">So I went <span class="building">home</span> and I burnt, and burnt all that was left of the illegal books and newspapers and so on. </sentence><sentence id="27">That must have been immediately before the trip to or immediately  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and he never warned us. </sentence><sentence id="28">I just want to tell in brackets a little human angle. </sentence><sentence id="29">We escaped of course and came back a couple of years(ph) later from <span class="country">Sweden</span> and right after our return my parents sent this, by then had retired, a big bunch of flowers saying, don't worry, you didn't warn us but we got away and safely we came back. </sentence><sentence id="30">Now, whether they heard anything from me or not, I don't know, it was a very, very difficult situation of course, being faced with this old preach of promise. </sentence><sentence id="31">But many, many years later when I was serving as chief editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put___.(ph) maybe 50 years later...and one of our staff members aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very easy because he sort of wanted to stay out of the limelight. </sentence><sentence id="32">I called him and asked him to make an exception and our reporter. </sentence><sentence id="33">He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunch of flowers I received one night which I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="34">These were the flowers which your parents sent me in 1945 after you came back from <span class="building">refuge</span> in <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">It meant a lot to him that some people were trying to forgive him for having broken his promise. </sentence><sentence id="36">Which of course could have cost us our lives, of course. </sentence><sentence id="37">At any rate, so the Danish underground movement started becoming more and more of a nuisance to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="38">At one point the Germans wanted the Danish Government, the Danish authorities had control over the Danish army, the Danish police, everything was in place. </sentence><sentence id="39">The Germans wanted the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground movement and to the Jews they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="40">Well it's a long story, but the Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once abolished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with the mark in their hands and . </sentence><sentence id="41">Then come September, September month and somebody else was figuring on what happened politically, especially on the German scene(ph) with regard to our situation as Jews in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">But suffice here to say that the Germans decided to extend the Jewish repression to Danish Jews, about 6,000 maybe 7,000 we were at that time and they ordered three <span class="spatial object">ships</span> to come from <span class="country">Germany</span> and anchor in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span> preparing to take us and a group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish authorities who had not yet been released, not succeeded in being released when the authorities went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43">So the Germans simply arrested them as one of the most, most  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection dishonorable, dishonorable events in modern day history, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="44">Of course they were arrested and kept against the constitution. </sentence><sentence id="45">Anyhow, the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> were prepared to take 7,000 Jews and a few hundred communists to <span class="country">Germany</span> or to <span class="country">Poland</span>, whatever they planned to do. </sentence><sentence id="46">But then something happened which enabled us to be warned beforehand and just shortly a warning came from the German who was the head of the German occupation authorities in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">His name was Wern Best(ph), Wern with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler that now was the time after the Danish-German cooperation had collapsed, now was the time to go for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">But for his own reasons, which is a very complicated matter, I don't want to go into too many details because people are much more versed into the details than I am. </sentence><sentence id="49">For his own reasons, he let the secret slip out and told one of his collaborators in the German, in the <span class="building">German embassy</span> . </sentence><sentence id="50">A fellow who  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51"><span class="populated place">Tuckawitz</span> quoted Best as saying, "I wish we could build a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> across the <span class="region">south</span> between <span class="country">Denmark</span> and <span class="country">Sweden</span> to aid these poor people to get safely away." </sentence><sentence id="52">We never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motive for his having to invent it, but there's no third witness. </sentence><sentence id="53">You only have his word for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his year fighting Jews, killing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="54">But his didn't find that it was in his best interests that particular moment of history where everything was going against the German, the German arms, after the invasion of <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">After the collapse of the German, the German military that fought in the Stantengard(ph) in <span class="region">Eastern Russia</span>, in <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">It was not for his, in his interests that this anti-Jewish action should secede, that's why he told it to <span class="populated place">Tuckawitz</span> who immediately informed the German, the Danish social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately went to the head of the Jewish community, a very respectable and respective lawyer of the <span class="building">high court</span> called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="57">And they went to him and told him, okay, now you better prepare for something because there are only a couple of days left. </sentence><sentence id="58">And it's very interesting, it has to be remembered because part of the <span class="populated place">Disney Land</span> atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews all over, all around us. </sentence><sentence id="59">From <span class="country">Norway</span> and all through the continent and we thought that we would go Scot-free and didn't prepare for anything. </sentence><sentence id="60">The Jewish community and leadership didn't even destroy the index of names and addresses of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">The Germans came one day and confiscated it. </sentence><sentence id="62">Still this was not enough for us, so start moving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="63">And this guy in and the Danish  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Germans will come after us. </sentence><sentence id="64">Where you go, everybody was on his own. </sentence><sentence id="65">The <span class="populated place">community</span> had not prepare any <span class="dlf">escape route</span> or any escape organization, nope, nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

which to some extent we were, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in the eyes of the Germans of course. </sentence><sentence id="152">By the way there was no yellow star, you know, there were no, there were no special legislation introduced by the Germans as regards to the <span class="region">Jewish part</span> of the <span class="populated place">Danish community</span>, Danish population. </sentence><sentence id="153">I went to <span class="building">school</span> early in the morning, maybe at ten o'clock or so, the headmaster came in and he said, "I'm sorry but you and you," he said, "you better come out, I have something to tell you in the <span class="dlf">corridor</span>." </sentence><sentence id="154">And I remember that suddenly we got up from our <span class="spatial object">desks</span> and were following him. </sentence><sentence id="155">Suddenly he turned around again and he said to the teacher, "you better come with me too." </sentence><sentence id="156">The teacher was also a part Jewish and then the fade away(ph). </sentence><sentence id="157">But you know, at that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Herbert, I would like to begin by asking you about your family background and when your parents or grandparents came to <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Well, as a matter of fact I am the first generation born in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">My father's side the family came just after the turn of the century from <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, a <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Romney</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Which is quite a famous <span class="populated place">town</span> in Jewish history because a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the <span class="country">Palestine</span> fighting(ph) with the Arab's(ph) back in the 20's came from there. </sentence><sentence id="163">Another guy called Rotenbeck(ph) who made the first project for electrification(ph) of <span class="country">Palestine</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="164">My, , the first group of chim(ph) agricultural pioneers came from the same small <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Romney</span> and they settled at the canya(ph) and they formed the first . </sentence><sentence id="165">Now my grandfather was what they call a kabaducmaha(ph). </sentence><sentence id="166">That means  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 better get out as quick as possible. </sentence><sentence id="167">So the pack(ph) that was left and of course they were on their way to <span class="country">America</span>, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="168">Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the in <span class="country">Germany</span> they had no more money to pay for their passage across the <span class="env feature">Atlantic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">So they made up their mind to go to some place called <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">Why <span class="country">Denmark</span>, because my grandmother had a brother who had immigrated earlier to <span class="country">Denmark</span> and he had sent some postcards saying that it was not a bad <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the money took them to Gomain(ph), that was, as I said around 1905 or 6 or something. </sentence><sentence id="172">And they settled down in one of the poorest quarters of <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>, which today of course is Bohem(ph) quarter and were renovated(ph) <span class="building">slum houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">It was, but they went there because it was <span class="populated place">Jewish district</span> and they could meet people which spoke their language, which was not Russian it was Yettish, they were not Russian speakers. </sentence><sentence id="174">And they could somehow repeat and rebuild to some extent the medium(ph) in which they had lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
