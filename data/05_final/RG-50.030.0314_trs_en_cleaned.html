<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: For the record, will you state your name, date of birth, place of birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Louis J. Walinsky, born in <span class="populated place">London</span>, <span class="country">England</span>, April 19, 1908. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: When did you come to the <span class="country">United States</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: At the age of four with mother and sister. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was already here at the time </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well, my father had a been a revolutionary in <span class="country">Russia</span> in his youth. </sentence><sentence id="16">Because he was only 16 when he had left. </sentence><sentence id="17">He got in trouble with the police for political activity; demonstrations and so on. </sentence><sentence id="18">In <span class="populated place">London</span> he had any number of jobs: He barbered, he was a weaver of <span class="spatial object">baby carriages</span>, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="19">But he also became a member of Prince Peter Kropotkin's Anarchist's Circle; and he got involved in journalism and I don't know how many years exactly that he lived in <span class="populated place">London</span> before coming to this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">He must have come in 1911 -- the family a year later. </sentence><sentence id="21">When he got here, as I said, he had been offered a job in <span class="populated place">Toronto</span> so we moved there. </sentence><sentence id="22">And we were there two years. </sentence><sentence id="23">He managed a <span class="building">local union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">My mother had two brothers in <span class="populated place">New York</span> who were embroiderers by trade; and they belonged to the ?__ </sentence><sentence id="25">Embroiderers and <span class="building">Pointers Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">And they were instrumental in getting that union to offer my father a job managing their <span class="building">local union</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">And that is what brought us down from <span class="populated place">Canad</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Then I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">I did pretty well in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="30">I went to <span class="building">Cornell</span> and studied economics, which became my profession later. </sentence><sentence id="31">I had two or three minor jobs, and then decided to teach <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">So I got a teacher's license in economics in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">And then, in -- that would have been 1931. </sentence><sentence id="34">Well, in 1932, a friend of mine who was a great drover, came and said "We ought to go to <span class="country">Germany</span>, because this guy Hitler is coming to power and it will be an interesting place to be. </sentence><sentence id="35">I'm going to go to the <span class="building">university</span>; why don't you come?" </sentence><sentence id="36">Well, while I was still at <span class="building">school</span> at <span class="building">Cornell</span>, I had taken out some insurance policy, so I had a little equity in it. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I was able to get $500 or $600 on that, and that took me to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">You have no idea what prices were in those days, but on the <span class="dlf">German/American Line</span>, travelling -- I think it was called 01:05: "student class"; it was really not very different from steerage -- the round-trip fare was under $200. </sentence><sentence id="39">In <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, I lived very, very frugally; I had to, because I had to stretch that money. </sentence><sentence id="40">And, well, you got breakfast with your <span class="interior space">room</span> -- that is, a cup of coffee and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="41">And then for lunch and dinner, I would go to the <span class="building">student house</span> in the <span class="dlf">Aranienburg Strasse</span> where you had two choices, I believe it was. </sentence><sentence id="42">You had an <span class="building">Eintopfgericht</span>, a stew; or you had soup and a stew. </sentence><sentence id="43">And for one, you paid 60 pfennigs;  that was 15 cents. </sentence><sentence id="44">But the other, you paid a mark; that was a <span class="region">quarter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="45">And the system was: You could get a second on the soup and a second on the vegetable, but not on the meat. </sentence><sentence id="46">So you would go with a friend and you would get your meal, the soup and the dish, and you would eat the soup fast and the vegetable, and your friend would go off and get the second, the refill. </sentence><sentence id="47">And then you would have -- well that was 25 cents and two ate on it. </sentence><sentence id="48">And in the evening, you'd go to the <span class="building">automat</span> where they had a very, very hearty bean soup that cost maybe 40 or 50 pfennig; and so those were the meals. </sentence><sentence id="49">Obviously, I wasn't 01:05: spending very much money. </sentence><sentence id="50">One thing in <span class="country">Germany</span> in those years, there were student rates on the metro equivalent -- at the film, <span class="building">theater</span>, opera; so you could go very, very cheaply. </sentence><sentence id="51">Anyway, you know, very soon, late in 1932, the Nazi business became quite tense. </sentence><sentence id="52">And some of my friends, Germans, were extremely concerned because they felt vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="53">And there would the Nazis be out on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> shaking their <span class="spatial object">collection boxes</span> Einweg nach <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>, oneway to <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was at a <span class="spatial object">student ball</span> in the <span class="populated place">Reichsgarten</span> the night of the <span class="building">Reichstag</span> fire. </sentence><sentence id="55">When I came out at about 1:00 a.m. that night, it was very strange; there were policemen all around the place. </sentence><sentence id="56">And I asked one, I said "What's happened?" </sentence><sentence id="57">And he said "There's been a fire in the <span class="building">Reichstag</span>." </sentence><sentence id="58">And I looked down, because it was in plain view down at the end of that walk, there were no signs of external fire damage. </sentence><sentence id="59">So whatever fire there had been, it was strictly internal. </sentence><sentence id="60">But of course when the press came out and Goebles made a story out of it, you'd think the whole <span class="building">building</span> had been burned down; and this was not true. </sentence><sentence id="61">Anyway, that was a little background to the DP thing that came later, you know; that eight months or so in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">And after the election -- the elections were in March and early in March. </sentence><sentence id="63">And Hitler was confirmed; he had already been in the <span class="building">Reichstag</span> seated. </sentence><sentence id="64">I had run out of money, and my father refused to send me any. </sentence><sentence id="65">He thought it was a good place to get out of. </sentence><sentence id="66">I didn't feel I was in any danger, and I don't think I was. </sentence><sentence id="67">But I did run out of money and I had to come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about your eight months in <span class="country">Germany</span> and the change of the mood of the people or ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes, a few things. </sentence><sentence id="114">There was a landlady of my friend who said, "You know there have been five major elections in <span class="country">Germany</span> in one year, and not one of them succeeded in creating a majority government?" </sentence><sentence id="115">And that was one factor in what happened later, because people gave up on the democratic process; it wouldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="116">But I've never seen that mentioned as an element contributing to Hitler's coming to power, and I think it was. </sentence><sentence id="117">Anyway, how did I get there? </sentence><sentence id="118">I was on a <span class="dlf">train</span> of thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Well, I was asking you a little bit about the mood in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> at that time and anti- Semitism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="128">So this lady, this Wirtin, the Hausfrau, the landlady, she said she was voting for Hitler because after Hitler, the communists would come and that's what she wanted. </sentence><sentence id="129">I  thought this was a strange prognosis -- psychology. </sentence><sentence id="130">But I initially had <span class="interior space">rooms</span> with the widow of a professor. </sentence><sentence id="131">So she was Frau Doctor Professor Resica (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="132">and a very German lady. </sentence><sentence id="133">I subsequently took a <span class="interior space">room</span> with a Jewish family, and I was with them until March, when things had already become quite bad. </sentence><sentence id="134">They had no intention of leaving. </sentence><sentence id="135">They didn't think it was necessary; they didn't think they ought to run or had to run. </sentence><sentence id="136">They were German, so -- anyway it's not easy to recall all of it, but there's enough to make it a very tense and dramatic experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Was there a palpable sense of the anti-Semitism, of restrictions against people in those days? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Well, no, the more open expressions of anti-Semitism -- the badge, the tagging of <span class="building">stores</span> and so on, that mostly came later. </sentence><sentence id="150">There wasn't much of that in the first months; and don't forget, I was out by March of "33. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Were you there during the book burning; was that during that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: I don't remember if that came then or shortly after. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about your family background: Was your family very conscious of being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Oh yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="160">I grew up on a <span class="dlf">Bronx street</span>, <span class="dlf">176th Street</span>; and our side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> was all Jewish, the other side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> was all Irish. </sentence><sentence id="161">We kids did not play with one another. </sentence><sentence id="162">We just -- they were there we were here and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="163">So my family's friends were all Jewish, and the only Gentiles really I knew as a boy growing up were our teachers at <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q:  or motivated you for some of the work that you did later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, my first real job after the <span class="building">university</span> was teaching school. </sentence><sentence id="172">I taught at the <span class="building">Abraham Lincoln High School</span> in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And it was a new <span class="building">school</span> with a very enterprising principal who had organized a great faculty. </sentence><sentence id="174">And the student population was, I suppose, 80 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="175">We had a few Blacks, and we had some Catholic children. </sentence><sentence id="176">But in those days, the <span class="building">Teachers Union</span> was a very active organization. </sentence><sentence id="177">And actually, the communists tried to take it over from inside. </sentence><sentence id="178">And so the less inclined split off and 01:17: formed the <span class="building">Teachers Guild</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And so that was also a part of a <span class="populated place">social milieu</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="180">And I was with the <span class="building">Teachers Guild</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">I was also, in those years, trying to write plays. </sentence><sentence id="182">I wrote one play about Hitler's coming to power which was published but not produced. </sentence><sentence id="183">And I wrote a number of other plays in the thirties after I had returned from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">And you know, I wanted to be a playwright, but I couldn't make it to <span class="populated place">Broadway</span>; and so at a given point, I said to myself "You can't do both things. </sentence><sentence id="185">You've got to pick one or the other." </sentence><sentence id="186">And so I decided to stay with teaching and I gave up play writing. </sentence><sentence id="187">But I had a play produced in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, a dramatization of Aldus Huxley's "Brave New World." </sentence><sentence id="188">But then, the war came and I had the opportunity to join the <span class="building">War Production Board</span>, which I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: In what year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: This is in "43. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I was with the <span class="building">War Production Board</span> into its demise early in 1947; and that was a great experience. </sentence><sentence id="212">It didn't have anything to do with Jewishness or Jewish causes or whatever, but I made the acquaintance for example of Lucius Clay who represented the Army at the Requirements Committee in the <span class="building">War Production Board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">And when I went to <span class="country">Germany</span> later for the <span class="building">ORT</span> I went to see him, and he received me very graciously. </sentence><sentence id="214">We spent 70 minutes together. </sentence><sentence id="215">And it ended with his giving our organization access to those <span class="dlf">enemy supply dumps</span>, which was an important element in equipping our <span class="building">schools</span>, which were pretty barren at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: What were your responsibilities with the <span class="building">War Production Board</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: The <span class="building">War Production Board</span> had a Program Committee and it had 01:20: the industry divisions which were operational -- steel, copper, paper, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="225">The <span class="building">operating divisions</span> were run by people from industry. </sentence><sentence id="226">The Program Committee had responsibility for reviewing the proposals made by those operators. </sentence><sentence id="227">And we were largely academic. </sentence><sentence id="228">So I was taken on as the pulp and paper specialist, because there was that <span class="dlf">opening</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">I knew nothing about pulp and paper. </sentence><sentence id="230">When I was offered that assignment to start, let's say, two weeks from then, I went back <span class="building">home</span> and lived in the <span class="building">New York  Library</span> for a couple of weeks and studied pulp and paper. </sentence><sentence id="231">And so I became an instant expert, as a lot of us did in those days in the <span class="building">War Production Board</span>, and in the Government, generally. </sentence><sentence id="232">So for most of time, that was my beat. </sentence><sentence id="233">But towards the end, I got more responsible assignments; because I became head of the Research and Analysis Group, which covered all the work of the program people. </sentence><sentence id="234">And so that got me into steel and copper and oil and any number of other things. </sentence><sentence id="235">And we had an interesting arrangement at the <span class="building">War Production Board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">The <span class="country">U.S.</span>, the <span class="country">U.K.</span> and <span class="country">Canada</span> had a <span class="building">Combined Raw Materials Board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">And the people in my group, our program committee types, 95 percent of our work was on the <span class="country">U.S.</span> but we also served as <span class="country">U.S.</span> staff to the <span class="building">Combined Raw Materials Board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">And we had toward the end a <span class="building">Combined Pulp and Paper Committee</span>, on which I served as executive secretary. </sentence><sentence id="239">And after VE Day, but before VJ Day, I was one of a 01:23: commission of two sent to the <span class="country">U.K.</span> and <span class="country">Sweden</span> to line up paper supplies for the <span class="region">liberated areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240"><span class="country">France</span> had an important national election coming up and they didn't have any paper for posters and voting materials; and I earned an undying love from one of my French colleagues for getting them 20,000 tons of paper for those elections. </sentence><sentence id="241">Why am I doing all of this? </sentence><sentence id="242">This has nothing to do with the <span class="building">ORT</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Well, I was just trying to get some background. </sentence><sentence id="265">Although actually, what you're talking about right now seems to me to be some training for all of the logistics and procurement that you got involved with for the Board. </sentence><sentence id="266">Why don't you tell me how you got to <span class="building">ORT</span> from <span class="building">War Production Board</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Well, it was through my father, who was a friend of Louie Boudine (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="271">who was one of three grand old men of the ORT and chairman of the American ORT Federation. </sentence><sentence id="272">He had already, starting in "46, had more than a little difference of opinion with Lubovitch (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="273">and <span class="populated place">Singalovsky</span> (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="274">the two European chiefs. </sentence><sentence id="275">And he had won a vote to create a financial and <span class="building">accounting office</span> for the ORT in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, where there would be some control over the numbers and statistics, so when the American ORT went to the Community Funds and foundations for grants, they'd be able to demonstrate what they had done with the money. </sentence><sentence id="276">Because he couldn't up to that point; he couldn't get the data out of <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">So he asked my father for some help. </sentence><sentence id="278">And my father persuaded me to go see him. </sentence><sentence id="279">And so our understanding was that I would come to the <span class="building">ORT</span> for a limited period of time to set up this <span class="building">office</span> and get it going. </sentence><sentence id="280">So that's how I came there. </sentence><sentence id="281">And that <span class="building">office</span> was in <span class="populated place">New York</span> on <span class="dlf">72nd Street</span> next to <span class="dlf">Broadway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">And I had got that under way two or three months only, but it was already rolling when -- I guess Boodine mostly, but others in the <span class="building">American ORT</span> became concerned about the way things were going in <span class="country">Germany</span> where they feared the program would collapse. </sentence><sentence id="283">And in their view everything depended on <span class="country">Germany</span> and the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">So they asked me to go over and take responsibility for the operation in <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="region">U.S. Zone</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> and <span class="region">British Zone</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Let me just stop you there. </sentence><sentence id="286">Why was there so much concern about the European operations? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Well, Dr. Lubovitch, who had started the work of the -- not started the work. </sentence><sentence id="288">He got the organization there, but Jacob Olaseky (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="289">who had been a director of ORT in <span class="populated place">Kowno</span> before the war on his own steam and initiative, he had started an <span class="building">ORT school</span> in <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span> where he was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then he got some of his former friends who were in other <span class="region">areas</span> to start training operations there; but they were scrounging, they were barefooted and bare-knuckled, and they had no outside support at all. </sentence><sentence id="291">Lubovitch came into that situation, you see, and "all right, here's the <span class="spatial object">ORT</span>, I'm the ORT." </sentence><sentence id="292">and made all sorts of commitments and promises of supplies and funds; and in order to help hiring instructors, they were promised -- you know the marks they would be paid were meaningless. </sentence><sentence id="293">The cigarettes they would be given would help. </sentence><sentence id="294">But the important thing was the few pounds sterling per month they were promised upon completion of their service in <span class="country">Germany</span> when they came out. </sentence><sentence id="295">Well, already in 1947, some people were coming out and they would come to an <span class="building">ORT office</span>, whether it was <span class="populated place">Paris</span> or <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> or <span class="populated place">New York</span>, and say "I'm so-and-so; I had so many months of service with ORT; you owe me so-and- so many pounds." </sentence><sentence id="296">But the people had no documentation. </sentence><sentence id="297">They had never been notified that nowhere was there a list of people who had been made that commitment and what their service had been and what they were entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="298">So some of these stories were already getting around, and it had elements of scandal. </sentence><sentence id="299">So that was one of the things that really terrified the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="300">They were already not in very good odor with the Community Funds all around the <span class="country">country</span>, because they hadn't been able to supply them with data on how many courses, where, how many students, what -- and so they felt pretty low before this happened. </sentence><sentence id="301">And as I suggested earlier or hinted earlier, Boodine was already into some kind of feud with Singelovsky and Lubovitch, and he was really determined to break their -- what he thought was a death grip on the organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Is there a way to sum up what the basis for the feud was; is it too complicated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Well, neither <span class="populated place">Lubovitch</span> or <span class="populated place">Singelovsky</span> had any administrative capabilities. </sentence><sentence id="321">What records they had were little slips of paper or chits in this <span class="spatial object">pocket</span> or that <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>; but no books, no sense of organization. </sentence><sentence id="322">In presenting data requested by our <span class="building">office</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, this new <span class="building">financial and accounting office</span> which we had to turn over to the AJDC budget -- I didn't mention that in'47, ORT had always raised its own funds; not very successfully. </sentence><sentence id="323">But in "47, they made an agreement with the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="324">The <span class="building">AJDC</span> would give us a subvention of $2 million a year to the <span class="building">ORT</span> in return for which ORT would refrain from any attempted individual fundraising. </sentence><sentence id="325">Well, the material that came from our <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and <span class="building">Geneva offices</span> to the <span class="building">AJDC</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> on request was just -- "never, never <span class="env feature">land</span>"; and pitiful, really. </sentence><sentence id="326">And then there's a third element which was personal. </sentence><sentence id="327">You  know, in the course of my, I guess it was two and a half years I suppose, with the ORT at different times in a personal conversation with Dr. Singelovsky said: I am the ORT. </sentence><sentence id="328">Ina personal conversation with Lubovitch, he said: I am the <span class="building">ORT</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And finally, to my surprise, in a personal conversation with Louie Boodine, he said: I am the <span class="building">ORT</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">So here you had these three egos. </sentence><sentence id="331">All of them old men, Lubovitch ill, Louie Boodine nearly blind -- but a bulldog; and he was determined to wrest what he thought was their death grip or chokehold on the organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Was the <span class="populated place">New York</span> operation pretty controversial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Which? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: When you were in <span class="country">Europe</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Did the Europeans react to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Oh, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="355">Singelovsky, chiefly, he sabotaged it. </sentence><sentence id="356">But of course, I started out -- I think I made a mistake at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="357">I should have gone over and gotten acquainted personally. </sentence><sentence id="358">Instead of which, I sat there in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and I dreamed up these beautiful reporting forms, you know -- financial and educational -- and developed a system where they would go out and they would come in a certain way and the information would be collated and so on. </sentence><sentence id="359">And <span class="populated place">Singelovsky</span> wasn't happy with that. </sentence><sentence id="360">And then quite soon, I told you I was sent over to <span class="country">Germany</span> to take over there, operationally. </sentence><sentence id="361">And I got a friend to take over in <span class="populated place">New York</span> for me. </sentence><sentence id="362">And while I don't think I was terribly politic, he was certainly less so. </sentence><sentence id="363">And both Singelovsky and Lubovitch couldn't abide him. </sentence><sentence id="364">They thought he was arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="365">But -- he was trying to do a job, but not in a terribly sensitive way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: So you were sent to <span class="country">Germany</span>; where were you sent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381"><span class="populated place">Munich</span> was the headquarters of the <span class="building">USO</span>, and it had had its own turmoil. </sentence><sentence id="382">There had been a conflict between Jacob Olaseky, who's the real hero in this whole thing, and the Westerners who had been sent in by Lubovitch to oversee the operation. </sentence><sentence id="383"><span class="building">Olaseky</span> was a DP. </sentence><sentence id="384">He had no face or status with the <span class="building">IRO</span> or the U.S. military. </sentence><sentence id="385">The liaison with them was important. </sentence><sentence id="386">Lubovitch knew that so he sent him people thinking they would play that role, but they would not attempt to interfere with the management of the actual training operations. </sentence><sentence id="387">Well neither of the people he sent in took it that way; they wanted to boss Olaseky. </sentence><sentence id="388">He wasn't having it. </sentence><sentence id="389">And so things there were also not very well. </sentence><sentence id="390">Well, the first time I was introduced to <span class="populated place">Olaseky</span>, George Bacca (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="391">was there. </sentence><sentence id="392">And he was the president of the <span class="building">American ORT</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">And I forget who else, maybe it was <span class="populated place">Lubovitch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">And <span class="populated place">Olaseky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">And it was plain that Olaseky was resentful. </sentence><sentence id="396">He was another mischief-maker, another outsider. " </sentence><sentence id="397">I've done all of this work; whatever is here, I've made without help, and now you're going to..." So when I saw how this was going I said to Jacob, "Let's you  and I step out of this meeting and have a word with one another." </sentence><sentence id="398">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="399">And when we were alone, I asked him, "What really is your problem here?" </sentence><sentence id="400">He said, "I have been the director in the <span class="region">U.S. Zone</span> and I cannot lose face by having someone coming in over me." </sentence><sentence id="401">I said, "What's your proposed solution, then?" </sentence><sentence id="402">He said, "Let the <span class="building">ORT</span> appoint you to be director for <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span>; then I can be under you, but I still am the chief in the <span class="region">U.S. zone</span>." </sentence><sentence id="403">I said "wonderful." </sentence><sentence id="404">And from then on, we never had a spat or difficulty of any kind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: In terms of how all these different groups worked together when you went over there, and you know was the <span class="building">UNRRA</span> with the <span class="building">IRO</span> at this point, maybe? </sentence><sentence id="431">During that period the <span class="building">UNRRA</span> became <span class="building">IRO</span> but it the same organization, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="432">Q: How did ORT work with all these organizations over there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: Well, we didn't have very much to do with anyone except the joint -- the <span class="building">AJDC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">We had some important business to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="436">You know, it was the <span class="building">joint</span> who gave supplementary rations. </sentence><sentence id="437">Supplementary rations were very important for us to be able to offer our students who were doing manual work in the <span class="building">metalworking shop</span> and the <span class="building">woodworking shops</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">So one the things was to get the <span class="building">joint</span> to classify students as being eligible for supplementary rations, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="439">Another thing was: It was a big organization, you know; they had a very large staff in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="440">01:40: They had all sorts of warehousing and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="441">And I was able to arrange with them where they had supplies that we needed and could use, for them to make them available to us and charge it off against our subvention, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="442">So that sort of thing was the relationship with <span class="building">joint</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">But we had nothing to do with other NGO's, or other voluntary organizations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: What about the <span class="building">US Military</span>, did you work with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: I told you of the thing with Clay after that it would be up to our district directors to work with the military guys in charge of their <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">We didn't have to much to do them actually. </sentence><sentence id="459">But we had a certain number of our people in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="460">And the uniform was important because it entitled us to -- well, it entitled the wearer to mess privileges, to PX privileges. </sentence><sentence id="461">The <span class="building">PX</span> privileges was awfully important. </sentence><sentence id="462">You could buy a carton of cigarettes at the <span class="building">PX</span> for eighty cents. </sentence><sentence id="463">That was worth 1,500 dollars in the equivalent Marks on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="464">So you know, this was important trading. </sentence><sentence id="465">And there were guys who made full use of that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="466">The guys -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: For themselves? </sentence><sentence id="478">A.Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: For themselves or for themselves? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: For themselves; for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="481">One American I brought over I known as a specialist in - - what would be the term -- what would be the term? </sentence><sentence id="482">In testing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: 2) What sort of administrative hurdles did you have as director of these  0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: Are there other examples you can give of the creative procedures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="488">Q: How you were able to stretch human end resources to make your work effective? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="490">A: Well, I think I mentioned the chief ones. </sentence><sentence id="491">In addition to the subension (ph) from the <span class="building">Joint</span>, much of which was to finance the work of the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>, the Women's American ORT -- the Ladies" ORT -- they were prohibited from raising funds, as such; but they could have value-received functions. </sentence><sentence id="492">And they raised some money that way. </sentence><sentence id="493">They came and got around and looked and tried to be helpful and contributed here or there with -- toward various projects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: For example? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Well, like providing a <span class="spatial object">car</span> for Olaseky, so he could have transportation; things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="502">Q: What other problems did you spot when you went over there that needed to be corrected? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: Supply, I think, was the first and most basic. </sentence><sentence id="505">Organizing the courses of instruction; because they been very al fresco. </sentence><sentence id="506">They had initially been left to the artisans who took responsibility for running the <span class="dlf">course</span>; but these courses had to be developed and organized and more standardized and so on. </sentence><sentence id="507">We had to develop an inspectorial staff who would go round and check out and make suggestion and try to give superintendency. </sentence><sentence id="508">We had a transportation problem of some seriousness, because we were spread all over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="509">Means of transportation were -- you know, you didn't have <span class="spatial object">trains</span> or <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">So we needed <span class="spatial object">cars</span> for our district directors and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q:  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: The chief thing on that had to do with the supplementary rations for the students; and that Ihave already been onto. </sentence><sentence id="521">We also, you know, gave -- I forget, now, how many -- but at least a few cigarettes each week to the students, and more to the instructors. </sentence><sentence id="522">And these were a very important part of their compensation. </sentence><sentence id="523">But the supplementary rations was really a most important factor in the students" well-being and their interest in continuing the work. </sentence><sentence id="524">You know, already, late in "47, I suppose it was, we were getting visiting delegations from <span class="country">countries</span> considering opening immigration to <span class="building">DPs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525"><span class="country">Canada</span> and <span class="country">Australia</span> were particularly interested and open. </sentence><sentence id="526">The people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> knew that when they were interviewed as candidates, to be able to say they had a skill or show they had a skill or show a diploma of proficiency was a very important element in their being accepted. </sentence><sentence id="527">So that was one of our big inducements. </sentence><sentence id="528">And these other things, the rations and cigarettes, were perhaps as important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: What did you think was your biggest challenge? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: I don't know whether this is challenge, but my greatest difficulty was, in a way, mediating between the Americans and the Europeans. </sentence><sentence id="542">This had nothing to do with the training operations in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="543">But it involved all sorts of things periodic meetings in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> and <span class="populated place">Paris</span>; flying back in mid-winter to <span class="populated place">New York</span> for a critical meeting when the American ORT was ready to cut off transfers of funds to our <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> and <span class="populated place">Paris</span> offices and wanted me to be the hatchet man, and serve as the president's deputy and do the money control myself, which I refused to do. </sentence><sentence id="544">But that was a very trying and tense and distasteful part of the job; but unavoidable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: Did you have a sense that the European ORT program and the <span class="country">US</span> or the <span class="populated place">camps</span> in various <span class="region">zones</span> were administered differently? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: I don't get your question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="553">Q: Well, I am wondering if, for example, in the <span class="region">British zone</span>, where clearly there was more of a different kind of interest in <span class="country">Palestine</span> and in training and all of that, whether they allowed the same amount of democracy and choice as in the <span class="region">US Zone</span>, where I think we were much more eager to prepare people for <span class="country">Palestine</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="555">A: Who's we? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: The <span class="country">U.S.</span>; the <span class="spatial object">American ORT</span>; no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="560">I don't think the American ORT people the <span class="building">Board</span>, were hot Zionists, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: I just thought maybe that the <span class="populated place">British-run camp</span> might have a different interest. </sentence><sentence id="564">But maybe  2 not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: There weren't enough of them to have significance from a policy point of view anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: Did any of this bickering between European and the Americans ORT organizations translate into the vocational program? </sentence><sentence id="570">Did they affect that at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: Not in terribly significant ways, but one instance that come to mind was, not long after I had been there, I had put the whole organization to work to develop a list of requirements, how many of this, that and the other <span class="spatial object">machines</span> do you need in your <span class="building">school</span>, in your <span class="populated place">district</span>, in the <span class="region">Zone</span>? </sentence><sentence id="574">And this was a painstaking operation in which the whole organization participated. </sentence><sentence id="575">And when it was done and I had reviewed and I done some pruning, I went to <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> for a meeting with Dr. Singelovsky and Dr. Lubovitch, and we arrived at an understanding of how much this thing would cost -- his engineers there did the estimating -- and who would what. </sentence><sentence id="576">Singelovsky undertook to do a significant part of the procurement. </sentence><sentence id="577">Well, it turned out months later he hadn't done a damned thing about that part of the procurement. </sentence><sentence id="578">Well that was an effect; that affected the pace and progress of the work. </sentence><sentence id="579">But he was not a killer diller. </sentence><sentence id="580">End of Tape #1  3 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: What was the general philosophy behind the ORT training in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: You're confident there must have been one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Wondering? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: Well, you know the <span class="building">ORT</span> got founded originally in response to a widespread belief that the Jew was a Luftmensch you know; an air person, feet off the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, not a down-to-earth, productive person. </sentence><sentence id="596">And in a way the thought was, through acquiring a skill and being an artisan, the Jew would demonstrate that this was a canard; it was not true. </sentence><sentence id="597">He was normal like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="598">In <span class="country">Germany</span>, I don't know how much philosophy there was. </sentence><sentence id="599">There was job to done. </sentence><sentence id="600">There were these people who were there waiting for a chance to emigrate who were idle; who had to have some constructive occupation. </sentence><sentence id="601">It was natural place and setting for Olaseky to undertake what he did. </sentence><sentence id="602">It was natural for the ORTs to see a great challenge and opportunity to go in there and make a real program out of it. </sentence><sentence id="603">He could not have gone very far by himself without the means. </sentence><sentence id="604">But I don't know that this adds to a philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="605">Opportunity, obligation, <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="606">There was great sympathy in this <span class="country">country</span> for the people for the people in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="607">And you know, you don't give a man fish; you give a <span class="spatial object">rod</span> and <span class="dlf">line</span> and teach him how to fish to support himself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: How large of an effort was the ORT operation at <span class="populated place">DP camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="623">A: We got up to something like ninety <span class="building">training instillations</span>; something like ten or eleven thousand students/enrollees; and something like a thousand employees, of whom about seven hundred would have been instructors and the others would be support staff of one kind or another. </sentence><sentence id="624">And I think that's about where it peaked. </sentence><sentence id="625">When I came in early in "47, we had in the <span class="region">U.S. Zone</span> about forty-five hundred people -- enrollees; and four hundred-odd staff. </sentence><sentence id="626">But it was growing very rapidly, and by the 02:05: end of the year it was up to eight thousand students and seven hundred-odd staff. </sentence><sentence id="627">I think, you know, for the first year, the people, the DP's, didn't really know what was happening and what was likely to happen. </sentence><sentence id="628">But then it became obvious that immigration was not going to be tomorrow; and it soon became obvious that they would need a skill or demonstrable skill. </sentence><sentence id="629">That would be important factor in their being accepted for emigration. </sentence><sentence id="630">So this is why they started coming in in much larger numbers. </sentence><sentence id="631">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Were the courses specific to any particular <span class="country">country</span> or <span class="populated place">destination</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="645">They had no way of knowing where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="646">Remember in "47, this was  4 before the creation of the state. </sentence><sentence id="647">It was still <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and the Brits were still very, very restrictive on admitting immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="648">Also sorts of tragic incidents of which you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="654">Q: Did the <span class="building">immigration authorities</span> you would work with from time to time, they were looking for -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: I had no occasion to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: You said they were coming through from -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: Yes, they were; they were. </sentence><sentence id="665">And they visiting <span class="populated place">camps</span> and interviewing people. </sentence><sentence id="666">And I don't -- I don't know that -- that say, <span class="country">Australia</span> or <span class="country">Canada</span> at any given time had in mind a concentration on metalworkers or machinists or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="667">They were looking people, though, who could become productive and self-sustaining. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: What kind of courses were given? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: I showed you that long list you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Well, give me a since of the range. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Well, metalworking, carpentry, woodworking, mechanics, radio mechanics, electricians, dressmaking and millinery. </sentence><sentence id="679">We had some in dental assistance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: How do you -- how did people -- how did the organizations decide what sorts of courses to offer; was there any plan? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="685">It was opportunistic in terms of the skills that were found there among the DP's. </sentence><sentence id="686">People who would be competent to transmit a skill. </sentence><sentence id="687">And so that became the basis for a course. </sentence><sentence id="688">02:09: Now, there is something else I didn't say earlier and is an important element here: "46, "47, "48, people wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="689">They wanted a chance to immigrate. </sentence><sentence id="690">If you offered a course, let's say, that would be a two-year course of training in something, no customers; one-year course, no customers; three months, yes. </sentence><sentence id="691">So you'd start off with a three-month course in metalwork. </sentence><sentence id="692">When that was concluded and nothing had happen on the <span class="dlf">immigration front</span>, you organized a sequel to it, another three months. </sentence><sentence id="693">And that was how - - but they were all short courses. </sentence><sentence id="694">They had to be; that was the psychology. </sentence><sentence id="695">People would  5 not commit themselves, couldn't commit themselves to a more prolonged stay when they didn't -- that was not what they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: Could people choose whatever course -- whatever kind of study they wanted? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="712">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="713">If it was being offered, if there was an instructor to give it and there was <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="717">Q: And were the opportunities different for men and women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: Well, they'd be different -- different courses of study, but the opportunity were there for everyone. </sentence><sentence id="720">Helena Volcalvich (ph.) </sentence><sentence id="721">who subsequently became Helena Olaseky, she was in charge of all the women's courses. </sentence><sentence id="722">She is an admirable, highly competent, attractive woman and she did a great job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: So there women courses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: Oh yes, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: But all programs would have been open to anybody who -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="733">A: Yeah, but I don't think we had men going for dressmaking or millinery; and we had very few girls signing up for woodworking or metalworking. </sentence><sentence id="734">Auto mechanics, that was what I didn't mention before that was quit popular. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Was there any effort to meet educational standards or anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: That was coming in later ,say toward the end of "48 and then in "49, it became -- it became -- it raised standards to a degree that impressed Franklin Keller, who had been a long-time principal of a <span class="building">vocational training high school</span> in <span class="populated place">New York City</span> and who is there as a specialist for the Army, and our French Dr. Frankel who had a life time of experience in vocational training. </sentence><sentence id="740">They were much impressed with the level that had been achieved. </sentence><sentence id="741">But it happen very quickly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: Who did most of the teaching in the training? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="747"> 02:13: </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: DP's. </sentence><sentence id="749">DP's who had been artisans, craftsmen; very few had been pedagogues. </sentence><sentence id="750">But in some of the more recent technologies like radio mechanics, electricians, we didn't have very many among them the DP population and we hired Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Did that work out pretty well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="756">A: Well, it apparently it worked all right. </sentence><sentence id="757">It jolted me when I first got exposed to it; I  6 couldn't -- I think I mentioned to this to you on the way here: When I was taken for the first time introduced to a German instructor and he held out his hand, I couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="758">But my host, Jacob Olaseky, who had been liberated in <span class="populated place">Landsberg</span>, he had no problem fraternizing. </sentence><sentence id="759">Another time I didn't mention this earlier, we had been out on the <span class="dlf">road</span> and it was time to stop for meal, and Olaseky and I went in to eat, he invited the driver to come with us, the driver who was a German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="764">Q: Did you think that that was indicative of the general attitude_? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="766">A: I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="767">I don't think it was general. </sentence><sentence id="768">I told you another story of a very different kind of Gordon who wanted me let him to qualify to drive <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, because he wanted to find a crowd of Germans and run the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> over them. </sentence><sentence id="769">So the feelings 02:15: were mixed to the individual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: What about <span class="building">training facilities</span>; where were all these <span class="spatial object">installations</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: Well, they were in <span class="populated place">camps</span> or in the <span class="populated place">residential community</span> where the DP's gathered in the given <span class="populated place">town</span>, and there was always a camp committee, and the <span class="populated place">camp</span> had to allocate <span class="interior space">space</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">And some were more generous, some were more desirous of helping and doing everything they could; and others were not so interested and not so benign in the facilities they provided; but that is how it went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: Did you ever need to coordinate with or use <span class="building">German facilities</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Not to my knowledge, but I would not have been involved with that sort of thing very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q: Or what about programs at <span class="building">German factories</span>, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="788">I know about those only as they were described to me, but I -- I never found time to go and see one of those things in operation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: But just for the record, there was training in <span class="building">German factories</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="793">A: I don't know if you'd call it training. </sentence><sentence id="794">It was the equivalent. </sentence><sentence id="795">What happen was that often, our people in their <span class="building">institutions</span> didn't have the materials necessary for the training; and these would be consumables like textiles, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="796">If you're going to make dresses, you need yardage. </sentence><sentence id="797">But if you don't have the goods, then what do your kids do? </sentence><sentence id="798">And sometimes in a <span class="building">class</span>, you have a one <span class="spatial object">sewing machine</span> and 15 pupils. </sentence><sentence id="799">This was early on. </sentence><sentence id="800">So improvising, our people at the <span class="building">headquarters</span> made arrangements occasionally for some of our students to work in a <span class="building">factory</span> as juniors or assistants or whatever, so they would get  7 some training that way. </sentence><sentence id="801">But this is really learning by doing, more -- vocational training is learning by doing anyway, but a -- taking part in a production process would not develop an artisan, it would train in a particular 02:18: operation rather than a general skill. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="812">Q: Were there efforts to provide psychological support or social services as well at some of the <span class="building">vocational school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="814">A: I brought in one guy from the <span class="country">States</span> who had taken a doctorate in guidance. </sentence><sentence id="815">And I thought he could make a real difference and I thought we needed such a person. </sentence><sentence id="816">But there was an unhappy outcome there. </sentence><sentence id="817">He hadn't been very long on the spot in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> when it was reported to me that he was in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="818">He had been to <span class="country">Switzerland</span> and he was caught at the <span class="dlf">borders</span> smuggling silver ingot. </sentence><sentence id="819">So I had no recourse; I had to put him on the next <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="820">I had to get him out of there or otherwise he would have gone to <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="821">That was the end of vocational guidance specialist program. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: A lot of these displaced persons needed all kinds of counseling and psychological support, doctors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: Well, maybe they did, but I don't think they got it from the <span class="building">ORT</span> in any formal way. </sentence><sentence id="833">It would've been truly incidental to the major activity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="836">Q: Would you say that the real enthusiasm for the training is </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="838"> being given? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: I don't know how to answer that. </sentence><sentence id="840">I visited a certain number of <span class="building">schools</span> and training operations briefly. </sentence><sentence id="841">I found them busy, active. </sentence><sentence id="842">I think the trainees were interested in what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="843">I think they found it valuable. </sentence><sentence id="844">I think their instructors were doing there best to be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="845">But when you ask about enthusiasm, I don't know -- I don't know how to answer that. </sentence><sentence id="846">These people have been, | think, too recently bruised to be very enthusiastic about anything, including life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="855">Q: There was a commitment to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: There was a future. </sentence><sentence id="858">They knew that. </sentence><sentence id="859">That was their objective: To qualify for and make possible the future. </sentence><sentence id="860">I don't think "enthusiasm" is the right word. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: Do you think that the operation was largely successful, from your experience; from what  8 you saw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: Of course. </sentence><sentence id="868">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="869">It was very, very far from perfect. </sentence><sentence id="870">It was certainly less than ideal, but considering the circumstances, the difficulties, the obstacles and everything else that went with the <span class="spatial object">beast</span>, I think one could take satisfaction in the accomplishment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="875">Q: Were there certain programs that were more successful than others, in terms of job skills or...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: Age, sex, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Well, I suppose mostly youngish people and young people. </sentence><sentence id="888">As many women as men, surely. </sentence><sentence id="889">Some youngsters and a few older people. </sentence><sentence id="890">It was a mixed -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: Did a lot of these people come with prior job skills? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Well, the younger ones would not have had many job skills. </sentence><sentence id="898">They wouldn't have had the opportunity to develop them. </sentence><sentence id="899">The job skills were among our instructors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="903">Q: What was general morale like in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="905">A: I think it varied. </sentence><sentence id="906">It varied with the same people from month to month. </sentence><sentence id="907">You know, it wasn't -- I told you that there were an awful lot of big bellies among the women because, it seemed, after experiencing all that death and observing all that death and losing so much family, everyone wanted to produce a baby. </sentence><sentence id="908">And the women were getting pregnant as fast as they could and hoping. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="914">Q: Did that pose any special problems or challenges? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="926">Q: Was this more of a thing the <span class="populated place">camp</span> administration had to deal with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="928">A: Well, I think, in terms of <span class="populated place">camp</span> administrations, I imagine there was quite a disparity of manner, quality, interests, humanity; and adressed it very much with the individual commander how those things were done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Were there a few <span class="populated place">camps</span> that you spent most of your time at? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: No, I was based in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>. </sentence><sentence id="933">And as it turned out, I soon became involved in a <span class="dlf">triangular run</span> from <span class="populated place">Munich</span> to <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> or <span class="populated place">Zurich</span> to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>; because that inner conflict within the <span class="building">ORT</span>, by 1948, I hadn't been there quite a year, the Americans insisted that as part of the solution to that organization or crisis, or so they conceived it, that I be designated as Secretary General of the <span class="building">World ORT Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="934">So I had to take that on on top of, you know, <span class="country">Germany</span>; and it meant that I had to spend a certain amount of time at the <span class="building">Paris headquarters</span> and I had to spend a certain amount of time in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span> back when it was in <span class="populated place">Singelovsky</span>. </sentence><sentence id="935">I didn't -- I didn't really give the DP operation the full attention it needed, because I didn't -- I had these other things thrust on top of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="940">Q:  0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="941">Q: This was all through <span class="dlf">ORT channels</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="944">I think -- well, we were ORT, weren't we? </sentence><sentence id="945">Singelovsky opposed this. </sentence><sentence id="946">He did not see a future for <span class="building">ORT</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="947">He thought the future of <span class="building">ORT</span> was in <span class="region">East Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="948">And when he learned that I had already initiated this program of shipping are <span class="spatial object">machines</span> to <span class="country">Israel</span>, he had me called to a meeting of the executive committee in <span class="populated place">Geneva</span>, and put me on the carpet for this unauthorized action, which I naturally defended. </sentence><sentence id="949">And the decision of that committee at the end of the meeting -- and these were his people -- I mean, his -- Swiss and other French and other friends who are on the executive -- the end of that meeting, the upshot was he was instructed to go to <span class="country">Israel</span> and start the work there. </sentence><sentence id="950">He didn't win that one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: How important were the ORT activities there in terms of providing a <span class="building">base</span> for future <span class="country">Israel</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: Well, this a question that's germane to the DP operation. </sentence><sentence id="962">02:32: It's not germane to the very scanty training there was in the <span class="country">U.K.</span> or the somewhat larger training that took place in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="963">It was -- or <span class="country">Holland</span> or <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="964">It was the DP population. </sentence><sentence id="965">And there it was most significant, because here came large numbers of skilled artisans who were the instructors and administrators, and trainees, who had developed from minimum to pretty decent skills in their chosen occupations. </sentence><sentence id="966">And then, of course, the training got underway very quickly in <span class="country">Israel</span>, because the ORT operation grew rapidly, because Olaseky went there. </sentence><sentence id="967">And this man was a dynamo. </sentence><sentence id="968">Actually, he's the man who saved the <span class="building">ORT</span>. </sentence><sentence id="969">And so whereas Lubovitch and Singelovsky and Boodine all thought that they were ORT, he was really the ORT. </sentence><sentence id="970">He was the heart and the soul and the dynamo. </sentence><sentence id="971">And I ended up loving this guy. </sentence><sentence id="972">He's a marvelous person. </sentence><sentence id="973">But you know what he told me once, though? </sentence><sentence id="974">It's very distressing. </sentence><sentence id="975">He said, "Louie, the best people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="976">We who survived were not the best people." </sentence><sentence id="977">And you know what he meant? </sentence><sentence id="978">The people who stole other people's rations, you know, who really managed at the expense of others. </sentence><sentence id="979">And the abnegating, the gentle, the kind, the good; they're the ones who did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="980">And he felt this very, very strongly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1002">Q: What made him so effective? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: Imagination, energy, creativity. </sentence><sentence id="1005">It's hard to describe. </sentence><sentence id="1006">One of the things I gave to the <span class="building">museum</span> a few years ago was a book about him that was done after his death which is composed largely of testimonials of any number of people; a small one from me. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And so they show a number of facets of this man. </sentence><sentence id="1008">But just -- just bursting with energy and creativity. </sentence><sentence id="1009"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1016">Q: Now, we're talking about the role of the DPs and the training in Europe and providing a foundation for <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Is there anything more that you want to add there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1021">I think that's -- that's the -- that's an element which I think is significant, that made a significant contribution to the early growth of the State, helped provide a foundation for its economy and enabled the newcomers to contribute to the <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="region">State</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And maybe the most important thing that came out of the DP experience was that contribution. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: And I'm not sure I want to inflict them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1030">Q: </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1032">A: But I must tell you my experience with the <span class="building">ORT</span> was my first experience with a Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And I had a subsequent one with the World Jewish Congress, another connection. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I thought, among the so-called leadership -- not only the triumvirate whose names came up so often earlier -- but, you know, members of the executive, members of the leadership ranks; a good deal of the motivation was that of personal ego, rather than, you know, the desire to do a good work. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And this is not very -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: How's it going? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1048">Q: Maybe you can address it? </sentence><sentence id="1049"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1052">A: And I had a wonderful commission, some great people on it. </sentence><sentence id="1053">But I had to carry the <span class="spatial object">ball</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And I was very grateful for the opportunity to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1059">Q: When you went over to <span class="country">Europe</span> in "47, and you took a look at the situation -- not just the ORT situation, but the general DP situation, was it -- was it what you expected? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Because it was so personalized. </sentence><sentence id="1063">You know, it wasn't ORT. </sentence><sentence id="1064">It was <span class="populated place">Olaseky</span>, it was <span class="populated place">Lubovitch</span>, it was <span class="populated place">Singalovsky</span>, it was <span class="populated place">Boudine</span>, it was clashes, it was this, it was that. </sentence><sentence id="1065">So -- it really took one off -- you know, the golfer says you come off the shot. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Do you play golf? </sentence></p></dialogue>
