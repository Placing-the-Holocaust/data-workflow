<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Shall I tell you directly about the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Yes...what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: In September February, March, April, May, June, July...we had a quiet life in my own <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">I had no problems. </sentence><sentence id="97">On September 15th at one o'clock in the morning, the police came to our <span class="building">house</span> and they told me to get dressed. </sentence><sentence id="98">They asked me what's your name. </sentence><sentence id="99">Moise. </sentence><sentence id="100">This is my wife. </sentence><sentence id="101">This one is my sister. </sentence><sentence id="102">Alright...get dressed and pack up your <span class="spatial object">luggage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">I didn't even have time to consult with anyone. </sentence><sentence id="104">Nobody could explain to us what was going on, why they were taking me away, so whatever I could find around I put in a blanket, wrapped up their blanket, took it on my back and they took us at a <span class="building">commissary headquarter</span> and there there were other people and they took us to this <span class="building">school</span>, this <span class="building">school</span> out on in the <span class="populated place">town of P</span>  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was a <span class="building">school</span> or a former <span class="building">synagogue</span>...I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="105">So anyway, all night long until in the morning, they kept bringing in people from <span class="populated place">Iasi</span>, gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="106">At a certain point they used to call our name and take us to the <span class="spatial object">cell</span> and they used to take information...ask us information about our address, the parents, where I was born...so anyway they filled up all kinds of forms. </sentence><sentence id="107">There were many many people. </sentence><sentence id="108">And we stayed there maybe about two days, until they finished the forms for all the people. </sentence><sentence id="109">After everything was done, they formed small groups and they took us to the <span class="building">train station</span> in . </sentence><sentence id="110">There there were <span class="spatial object">trains</span> waiting for us, <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span>, empty. </sentence><sentence id="111">They were <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span>, yes. </sentence><sentence id="112">We had to climb into the <span class="spatial object">cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">We were too many of us in a <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">At least we were very crowded which found our little place and we stayed in these <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> maybe another day, one night, in the <span class="building">train station</span> until they brought other <span class="spatial object">trains</span> from other parts of the <span class="country">country</span>, also a <span class="spatial object">train</span> full of gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="115">They attached those newly arrived <span class="spatial object">cars</span> to ours and the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> left. </sentence><sentence id="116">Whenever <span class="spatial object">train</span> stops we were allowed to get out just for our basic needs. </sentence><sentence id="117">They would occasionally open the <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">We could get off, just for a little time and we kept going until we crossed the <span class="env feature">River</span> , but it took a while. </sentence><sentence id="119">Then we crossed the <span class="env feature">River</span> and even then they would open the <span class="dlf">door</span> at times so we could go out. </sentence><sentence id="120">Maybe they gave us some <span class="env feature">water</span> too...and then we crossed the <span class="env feature">River</span> and we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="121">Whenever the <span class="spatial object">train</span> would stop, we arrived at the place where we could see <span class="populated place">Odessa</span> (ph), not close by but far away, at least different uh <span class="region">suburbs</span> of <span class="populated place">Odessa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">On the left, so that the <span class="spatial object">car</span> was on the right on a <span class="dlf">secondary rail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">In front of us were some military people, some soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="124">The soldiers were not doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="125">They did not have any kind of military exercises. </sentence><sentence id="126">They just stayed there doing nothing and there were some <span class="dlf">ditches</span> near them, and the soldiers, they...we stayed in our <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and we stayed there from morning...I don't know exactly what time, but we stayed there until evening, maybe three, four, five in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="127">The soldiers did not leave. </sentence><sentence id="128">They received food. </sentence><sentence id="129">We saw that because there was a right in front. </sentence><sentence id="130">They just stayed without doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="131">As soon as the mechanic engineer of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> gave the signal for the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to leave, we boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span> again and we saw that the soldiers left as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Why wouldn't they come back from the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, if they'd go pick them up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="280">They came to send you back to the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="281">We came as a delegation...we have an authority. </sentence><sentence id="282">We received an order from <span class="populated place">Bucharest</span> to send you back to <span class="country">Romania</span>, but if you want to go back to <span class="country">Romania</span>, the <span class="country">country</span> does not have any money so you must pay your own expenses back from <span class="populated place">Transnistria</span> to whatever your <span class="building">home</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="283">Can you imagine that. </sentence><sentence id="284">Anybody gives the shirts off their back or anything just to go

we had. </sentence><sentence id="297">They took the last hope which you just sold for a piece of bread or a potato. </sentence><sentence id="298">There was we sold anything for, but anyway...we stayed at this <span class="dlf">farm</span> with our two hundred grams of this flour and nothing else...nothing, nothing else, and occasionally we got these two potatoes per person, and we stayed there until November. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="299">In late November, other people came and took us to . </sentence><sentence id="300"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence

class="dlf">fences</span>, very good quality <span class="building">homes</span> but empty. </sentence><sentence id="304">There was no food in there, no fire, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="305">When the people evacuated, they took everything with them, so they took us there. </sentence><sentence id="306">There were <span class="building">homes</span> with two <span class="interior

you couldn't even move around. </sentence><sentence id="308">All you had <span class="interior space">room</span> is to stretch out to sleep and a little <span class="dlf">path</span> to go out to the

knew more about these things, started to give us this flour again, two grams per head and we stayed there, hoping to be repatriated to <span class="populated place">Bucharest</span> so we stayed there till maybe until February, March, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="311">And again somebody came to say the order came from <span class="populated place">Bucharest</span> that you go back to <span

had we sold for potatoes, for bread. </sentence><sentence id="317">We had really nothing, so during the night they took us and we started again marching about two days to return to the <span

cold. </sentence><sentence id="320">The children were naked, without shoes, without food. </sentence><sentence id="321">In the <span class="building">train station</span>, the guards surrounded us.

</sentence><sentence id="326">Nothing is true. </sentence><sentence id="327">Go back. </sentence><sentence id="328">There were old people who said well, if we have to go back, we'll just die on the

people arrived at the <span class="building">station</span> of the gendarmes and somebody, probably the mayor...I don't know who...then said why did you run away from : You had <span

were protected from . </sentence><sentence id="340">They showed us, somebody from the <span class="populated place">village</span>, are going to find some straws. </sentence><sentence id="341">We put them in the <span class="dlf">window places</span> and in the <span class="dlf">door places</span> and on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> to protect ourselves, so we built this protection.

with this two hundred gram of flour. </sentence><sentence id="344">It was not...probably was a practice everywhere, even in the larger <span class="populated place">villages</span>.
