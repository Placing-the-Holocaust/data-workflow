<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">HAROLD ZISSMAN May 24, 1995 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Before we get into some of the specific battles, I wanted to ask you a few general questions about when you were with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="4">It seemed like there were a lot of different groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="7">How coordinated were you all? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: Talking about 1943, at that particular time, there was a total coordination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: You mean, when the Soviets came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I mean, when we had contact with <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: Prior to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: But prior to that, there were a lot of groups on their own. </sentence><sentence id="17">Be that they were fighting for the same cause, when I mean the same cause, I mean that there were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="18">Or at the same time, there were other type of partisans which I had before mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="19">We used to call them "the white." </sentence><sentence id="20">When we talk about Soviets, we always talk about red, so, therefore, the white Poles, for instance, those were Polish partisans who were against the Soviets, while they also were against the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="21">And to top it all off, they also were against the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: This is the <span class="spatial object">AK</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: That was the <span class="spatial object">AK</span>, which is called <span class="building">Army Krajowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">In other words, the <span class="building">land army</span> or <span class="building">nationalist army</span>, which they were. </sentence><sentence id="32">And they really had, to the best of my knowledge, they were very much supported from <span class="populated place">London</span>, <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">That they were, because <span class="populated place">Chechovky</span> (ph) was one of them, which it was the former marshal sort of in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">And there were people who were -- the Polish, who were saved from the outbreak of war who retreated to <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">And from there they sort of carried on a certain amount of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: You had contact with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Well, we had contact with them, be that we, that we got some of their guys sort of by way of surrounding them and knowing what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="45">It was our job to know who the enemy was. </sentence><sentence id="46">And really who the enemy was, besides the Germans, was a big story to tell about it, because they had implants in all of these here ways in order for them to know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="47">And every once in a while, as I aforementioned in my other chapters, was that we located some prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="48">We found prisoners who sort of came -- we knew there were many POWs who joined the ranks of the partisans that were specific spies, German spies, implants. </sentence><sentence id="49">And we learned how to discover the way they were signified by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="50">They would have a tatoo maybe underneath the arm just like the Gestapo would have. </sentence><sentence id="51">And some of them, which for hiding purposes, when we started to undress them, we found <span class="spatial object">maps</span> that they were carrying with them. </sentence><sentence id="52">And we knew that a guy who escapes a <span class="populated place">Prisoner of War Camp</span> is not  equipped with a <span class="spatial object">map</span>, and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because that would have been foolish to think. </sentence><sentence id="53">So that suspicion -- and believe me, we made them talk. </sentence><sentence id="54">The command made them talk, and this is how we knew of the various groups. </sentence><sentence id="55">Before going too long, I would like to mention at this point here that my wife lost a brother to one of these here AK types you already identified them by their name, or I call them the National Polish Partisan Group. </sentence><sentence id="56">But he and another young kid -- they both were of the age of 14, 15, and their best job to be invisible at their work is because they were kids. </sentence><sentence id="57">And their job used to be more to go, as we call them, to the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">They would look through main <span class="dlf">rails</span>, and those kids, they were not so visible -- and plant a <span class="dlf">mine</span> over there and then go off. </sentence><sentence id="59">And then there would be other explosions. </sentence><sentence id="60">They were caught by this, which it was on the other side of <span class="populated place">Niemen</span>, as we called it. </sentence><sentence id="61">The other side of the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">And they were caught up, and needless to say, that they were immediately recognized to be Jews. </sentence><sentence id="63">And for that reason alone, they were killed and shot. </sentence><sentence id="64">Nothing else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="65">So first their being kids. </sentence><sentence id="66">Second, they were partisans, maybe the priority would have been Jews -- that they were Jewish, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="67">So evidence like this, it was known to us. </sentence><sentence id="68">As I will enter a little bit later, telling you on one time that we were purposely sent like masqueraded in disguise of the Polish partisans because our command definitely wanted to implant partisans on the other side of the <span class="dlf">Niemen</span> near <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> and we were on a search missions, which I will tell it when I come to this part of talking about , yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: What I'm trying to understand is that -- there were different groups that were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="95">Before everything was coordinated through <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>, was there any order to this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="98">Was there any coordination? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: It was coordination that a command would meet sometimes together and talk about certain work and plans, if it was planned a coordinated attack. </sentence><sentence id="100">So this guy would be on flanked, and this partisan would use so many men, the other one. </sentence><sentence id="101">So to say that there was coordination, yes. </sentence><sentence id="102">But it wasn't the kind of coordination by command and so on. </sentence><sentence id="103">In other words, a staff was organized in 1943 before we made full contact with the paratroopers that were sent to us. </sentence><sentence id="104">Because at the same time, which I must tell you, in that same year a little bit later, drops from <span class="spatial object">planes</span> through the night became visible even in our <span class="region">area</span>, while before it used to be just in the big <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">But they would drop to us supplies, and with these supplies came messages, and so on in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="106">The supplies were weapons mostly. </sentence><sentence id="107">Not so much that it was of foodstuff or anything like that, but that was -- and later on in "43, we had radio operators with us who were in constant contact with <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>, as well as the other outposts of staff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: While we're on this, well, you might as well tell me how things changed in "43, because this seems to be where we're headed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Well, I touched <span class="building">base</span> in earlier part, but here specifically, for instance, when we're talking about the attack, where we attacked the <span class="building">garrison</span> in <span class="populated place">Ruda Slaska</span>. </sentence><sentence id="120">This was already an organized from all, because the participation was flanked by all the partisans in maybe located in 30-mile distance -- 30 mile, I mean square mile -- throughout all the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">But various groups were brought in, be that they were ambushed, be they were in the fighting,  and it was a real preplanned because for the first time, we were shown off at that time a <span class="spatial object">Panzer truck</span> and we were shown up at that particular time -- that <span class="spatial object">Panzer truck</span> drove in in the vicinity nearby. </sentence><sentence id="122">Not exactly. </sentence><sentence id="123">And the first shot was fired from a <span class="spatial object">cannon</span>, which it was something again hard to believe that we mustered that, but it was done because we heard originally before attack that they built up <span class="interior space">bunkers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Now, to specify who they are, which is found on the <span class="spatial object">map</span>, that would have been on the main <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">The main <span class="dlf">road</span> we're talking about was a <span class="dlf">dirt road</span> going through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was not a real <span class="dlf">road</span> to the extent of the <span class="dlf">woods road</span>, what we mean. </sentence><sentence id="127">And it was leading between the between towards <span class="populated place">Gotha</span>,  ammunition we all carried with us, we never carried enough ammunition to ensue a battle three or four hours. </sentence><sentence id="128">And that's what the battle was, and we succeeded -- only because of that artillery fight, we succeeded to drive them out. </sentence><sentence id="129">Meaning, they retreated, so they came back at a time later and restarted again. </sentence><sentence id="130">But our satisfaction was that we showed the enemy, well, you have no <span class="dlf">safety ground</span> over here. </sentence><sentence id="131">And from there on, the miserable life ensued until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="132">It was the last year, sort of, for us of the war, and we were talking about the year right now, let's say, between August of 1943 to about August 1944. </sentence><sentence id="133">But those <span class="env feature">forests</span> a year later became liberated by the Red Army. </sentence><sentence id="134">So that was the hardest year to survive as a fighting or partisans at all in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: But that, too, the fact that at this time everything was coordinating through <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">You were able to get more and better supplies, and that there was really system, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="156">And a command. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="160">How did that change the way you operated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="164">Before a command of a group, as I said, firstly the names have changed. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was no longer Zychov's (ph) group or Bullock's (ph) group or Fredia Kommunarsk's group. </sentence><sentence id="166">All of sudden, there was names, for instance, at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="167">We started to hear organizing of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="168">We started to hear Russian names of heroes. </sentence><sentence id="169">You know what I mean, to be named, you know what mean? </sentence><sentence id="170">And this is the way it had gone on to a total change that the Soviet ties to the all extent that even the name. </sentence><sentence id="171">The other innovation was that all of a sudden, it began to get the commissars. </sentence><sentence id="172">And the commissars, as you have probably heard over about it, they were political commanders. </sentence><sentence id="173">So while even at a time as we were, we still had to give our ears to these political commissars. </sentence><sentence id="174">To hear the stories of Communism and Socialism and what their aim is and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="175">So this was a big kind of innovation that it's sort of in a way unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="176">How was it going to happen? </sentence><sentence id="177">Yes, it did. </sentence><sentence id="178">In other words, no matter what we were exposed to, we must have been exposed to politicizing the situation in the same way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">The second -- the third change was -- I already said the name changed, the <span class="building">command post</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="180">The third was that from now on, no commander was a commander that he made his own decisions. </sentence><sentence id="181">Any operation, even for instance, the <span class="region">territory</span> was divided from where we draw our supplies and which type of farmers could we come to get supplies from. </sentence><sentence id="182">In other words, sort of not attack our own. </sentence><sentence id="183">So before it was we knew the <span class="region">area</span>, the commander knew, for instance, in these here <span class="populated place">settlements</span> don't go barter because we got too many of our own people. </sentence><sentence id="184">So we don't even go to ask them not to give food. </sentence><sentence id="185">We would come and take, let's say, cattle or whatever it is, and give them a receipt, so that when the Red Army came, you will be paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="186">We knew it's not -- you know what I mean, but that was the way it went on, sort of to make it official, other than it used to be saying we robbed the farmers for food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="187">Well, too, I don't say you don't because certain times like when the situation was bad, we were blockaded, we couldn't help it; we had to carry things on on our own. </sentence><sentence id="188">But in the most of the cases, the <span class="region">territory</span> was divided that this and this companies go for their needs here and there. </sentence><sentence id="189">And other <span class="building">companies</span> use someplace else, and that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="190">When a battle needed to be organized, it was decided in the general staff. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Was this an improvement or a problem? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: As a Jew we feel it improved one thing, that we sort of felt we were not an open prey. </sentence><sentence id="193">That there's more authority; however, individually meeting up as used to call them the "Easterners" was touching. </sentence><sentence id="194">That's how we used to refer to them. </sentence><sentence id="195">Those who were the paratroopers who were thrown down. </sentence><sentence id="196">Jokes still went on. </sentence><sentence id="197">We saw a big change, the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="198"> came to be used to show off the command of a lieutenant or captain, while </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="200">Just as <span class="populated place">Ruda Slaska</span> was a very important thing for us to knock out, and we were freed for about a few months, that they were knocked out. </sentence><sentence id="201">So (a) it was satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="202">On the other side, controlling the other main <span class="dlf">artery</span> which it was a much better <span class="dlf">road</span> -- going through it wasn't like a <span class="dlf">forest road</span> -- was <span class="populated place">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="203">The Germans managed that after so many miles apart they sort of build <span class="building">garrisons</span> of controlling certain landmarks to be of their own, utilizing the local militia, the local people, which they were in the militia, and few Germans. </sentence><sentence id="204">You got to remember the importance of that particular time, the Germans said to make an elite force out of them. </sentence><sentence id="205">Well, their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here special groups, which they were doing in <span class="country">Byelorussia</span> and <span class="country">Ukraine</span> and killing them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="206">So rounding up Jews to kill from the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> or otherwise, that was their elite force. </sentence><sentence id="207">They had everything one could wish for, and they always were told, "If you don't do that, you're going to be sent to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>." </sentence><sentence id="208">And the sending to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> to face the <span class="region">Russian front</span> was a big punishment because, as history told us and we know already with Marshal Polis (ph) at that time, which would be the armies which the big rift did happen. </sentence><sentence id="209">And the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end. </sentence><sentence id="210">There was no retreating and no giving up, so if it meant one-on-one fights after when it happened and the Germans retreated, it was that. </sentence><sentence id="211">So the Germans did not have that 10 days with <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> that originally the way in "41, that was their slogan. </sentence><sentence id="212">Within 10 days they'll be in <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">They realized that by 1943 how fast only was how fast are they retreating, and they did not want to retreat faster than they were beat out. </sentence><sentence id="214">So the Germans used to keep that to their forces. </sentence><sentence id="215">Hey, if you're not going to behave well, you go to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">To the <span class="dlf">Russian front lines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">So a lot of the local people were given a choice. </sentence><sentence id="218">If you do not want to be drafted to go to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>, you have a choice to serve in the <span class="building">militia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">So a lot of them who did want either escaped and joined the force. </sentence><sentence id="220">So we had another incoming force because of that. </sentence><sentence id="221">And those people became good fighters, because they were fighting for their own local causes. </sentence><sentence id="222">So they built there for, like I said, <span class="building">Ruda Slaska</span> over here. </sentence><sentence id="223"><span class="populated place">Cozlo-Chechnya</span>, which it was an ended <span class="dlf">field</span> say between <span class="populated place">Slonium</span> and on the way like we were going to <span class="populated place">Lida</span>, so that was a big <span class="building">post</span> that they built a big <span class="building">garrison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">And that <span class="building">garrison</span> was taking care of all of these <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">This was a new trick again that our command devised. </sentence><sentence id="226">That while we wanted to attack <span class="populated place">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph), we didn't directly come to attack it there, but we went to attack another place. </sentence><sentence id="227">The other place was a big <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a <span class="dlf">wooden bridge</span> over the <span class="env feature">Niemen River</span> in <span class="populated place">Melnitsa</span> was the name of that little <span class="populated place">town</span> nearby. </sentence><sentence id="229">So we sent forces in setting up, you know, places setting up in hiding and I was -- the forces to jump out in case the German police come going there. </sentence><sentence id="230">So we set up ambushes on them, so we came, poured gasoline, naphtha, whatever we could get a hold of, including turpentine on that <span class="dlf">wooden bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">And we started to set a fire. </sentence><sentence id="232">We knew that once that <span class="dlf">bridge</span> is going to go a fire, and that would be dropped a tremendous communication on a main <span class="dlf">road</span> like this here. </sentence><sentence id="233">That the <span class="populated place">Cozlo- Chechnya</span> (ph) outpost over there would go, everybody would go out to come there to fight the partisans while putting out the fire at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="234">It worked. </sentence><sentence id="235">No sooner they started to run and that was about 30 miles away. </sentence><sentence id="236">No sooner all their <span class="spatial object">vehicles</span> and we saw them in from <span class="building">Lida posts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">The way they're starting to run towards that <span class="dlf">bridge</span> that we set a fire, we attacked them. </sentence><sentence id="238">And then easily with a few troops that were left in there, so it was no problem for us to take over. </sentence><sentence id="239">It was one Jew, we used to call him "The Bearded Moses." </sentence><sentence id="240">And he was a short man with a beard and he was the most heroic person known in that battle of <span class="populated place">Cozlo-Chechnya</span>  (ph). </sentence><sentence id="241">He by that time had killed about 15 policemen, until the 16 policemen from the back saw it. </sentence><sentence id="242">You know what I mean, that what he is there. </sentence><sentence id="243">He ended him and with a single bullet killed sort of our -- The Bearded Moses. </sentence><sentence id="244">And he was well known in the <span class="region">area</span> for his heroism and so on. </sentence><sentence id="245">So, as I started to say, we captured; we had a big battle and the <span class="spatial object">Howitzer</span> was the sounding of time that we sent out. </sentence><sentence id="246">Which again, it was a new type of <span class="spatial object">cannon</span>, and I was at the moment serving near the <span class="spatial object">Howitzer</span> as the second man. </sentence><sentence id="247">And between all the partisans which they were needed to be -- so two parts. </sentence><sentence id="248">It wasn't a matter that this group, that group, all partisans who were on the force were taking place on that battle. </sentence><sentence id="249">And within a few hours, no sooner they found out over there, we told their people coming out, they started to go back. </sentence><sentence id="250">As they started to go back, they were engaged in fire with us, because we attacked them. </sentence><sentence id="251">So it was not just the <span class="building">garrison</span> itself. </sentence><sentence id="252">They suffered tremendous casualty and they suffered the prestige that once more the partisans were able to come and knock out the major <span class="dlf">post</span> connecting and even threaten. </sentence><sentence id="253">The <span class="dlf">bridge</span> was burned apart. </sentence><sentence id="254">It took them weeks to have it repaired, so basically our aim, what we wanted, is disrupt German communication and disrupt the going on that they had to bring more forces and use people. </sentence><sentence id="255">So, per se, what we showed the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> was answered in all ways the way we were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="256">However, this time it was no longer a local job, but was a command coming all the way -- who know, maybe it came even from <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">I am not equipped to tell you exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: A couple of questions for clarification. </sentence><sentence id="318">Can you guess at how many partisans would have been involved in this operation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: I guesstimate that at least it was between 800 to 1,000 partisans. </sentence><sentence id="322">At least, because to cover just basically the <span class="region">area</span> even in a thin kind of a way from all <span class="building">command posts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">We're talking a <span class="dlf">perimeter</span> of battle that at times lasted for about maybe 10, 15 miles. </sentence><sentence id="324">In other words, they were fighting in one <span class="region">area</span> near the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">Then around <span class="populated place">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph), which it was a small, little <span class="populated place">town</span>, but it was quite a <span class="building">garrison</span> established over there. </sentence><sentence id="326">So again, we showed the biggest amount of power as it was previously ever displayed because on direction, we didn't use that much of a force. </sentence><sentence id="327"><span class="building">Ruda Slaska</span>, we didn't use that much of a force. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: So that means these 1,000 or whatever number partisans maybe were broken into companies of a hundred... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: Correct, correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="340">And there were men and women fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Were men and women, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: It stands out to me, one -- Rachel was her name -- and she was with <span class="populated place">Fania</span> (ph) <span class="building">Kommunarsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">I mentioned the name to him before. </sentence><sentence id="349">Rumor had it she was his girlfriend, and to look at that young lady dressed with a uniform on that horse, it was not so common to our  era, you know what I mean, to see a young lady in uniform and horseback riding and be participating in battle. </sentence><sentence id="350">So a lot of these here things became more obvious at this time, that the fighting by young ladies were justified, you know what I mean, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="351">And they were renowned about it, we knew it. </sentence><sentence id="352">We saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: Were the women treated differently than the men, than the partisans .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Well, they were always a female. </sentence><sentence id="362">That still went on, and in any army, you can understand. </sentence><sentence id="363">A female had her priorities. </sentence><sentence id="364">Of course, the commander when he wanted a girl, she was his girl. </sentence><sentence id="365">You know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="366">So call it what you want to, but the feminine wish or ways, or whatever it is, was very much visible at a particular time. </sentence><sentence id="367">Even when she was riding on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="368">Even though that she was, you know, a good fighter and so on, it still was, on the other hand, that intuition of her feminine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: Were women given as much responsibility or different kinds of responsibilities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: Well, to answer you did we have a commander woman, no. </sentence><sentence id="380">So, obviously, you can understand to judge from here that it was still a man's world and not a woman's world, or equal world. </sentence><sentence id="381">No. </sentence><sentence id="382">However, it was -- in the Russian Army to see women, it was no novelty. </sentence><sentence id="383">We already seen it from "39 when the Soviets came to us. </sentence><sentence id="384">So it was perhaps different than we saw it from the Polish Army from before, but women were in the Soviet Army as an equality marker. </sentence><sentence id="385">So that part talking from a Soviet point of view, if you want to say, it was no novelty. </sentence><sentence id="386">But in the partisans, yes, it was a novelty to see because if I was going to percentage-wise in any <span class="building">company</span>, if they could have been one percent, it was already a big marker. </sentence><sentence id="387">You could find, for instance, in our <span class="building">company</span> there maybe were seven or eight women, and, like I say, the most of them were in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">Which, you know, where is a woman's place? </sentence><sentence id="389">As sort of saying, it's in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">And they were utilized in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="392">Or ina, let's say, as nursing, for instance, in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="393">So it was as the past was for placing the women in this kind of a ways. </sentence><sentence id="394">You know what I mean, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: But there were women who were on the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="414">In the Soviet regular army. </sentence><sentence id="415">But with the partisans, depending on the occasion and where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: Well, there's one other thing that confuses me a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="420">When you talk about going into a <span class="building">garrison</span> and you use the word, "police," are you talking about local recruits or Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: <span class="building">Police</span>, whenever we speak, we never referred to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="424">That was local. </sentence><sentence id="425">So being that they used to be called by the Russian name of militia or the German police were organized -- the head of the police was a German. </sentence><sentence id="426">Or there were a few much, which it was jobs for the Germans who maybe were either injured or deserved the rank. </sentence><sentence id="427">That they were not going to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>, so from the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>, from the <span class="building">hospitals</span>, they were given sort of something better. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: Change tape. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: But with or without , it was contribution made by the local companies to supply people to join these paratroopers right now on that special mission. </sentence><sentence id="430">I was picked to be one basically because I spoke fluent Polish. </sentence><sentence id="431">Secondly, because I hailed from that <span class="region">area</span> from <span class="country">Poland</span>, and with me was another young man. </sentence><sentence id="432">He was a Nordic, blonde hair, and could be easily masqueraded as a non-Jew, which it happened as we shall tell later. </sentence><sentence id="433">That I was sort of in a way almost discovered that I am not what I am supposed to have been because I couldn't hide my face and makeup, we didn't use at the time. </sentence><sentence id="434">So the other boy's name which also was Jewish and he was from my platoon was Polotchik (ph), that's what his name was. </sentence><sentence id="435">And we had <span class="region">local area</span> people join us. </sentence><sentence id="436">One guy who was a graduator of Polish officers" <span class="building">school</span>, <span class="populated place">Surgay</span> (ph), <span class="building">Surgay Balli</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="437">That was his name, he was sort of Polish and white and Russian mixed in him, so either way you would call him Polish would be correct. </sentence><sentence id="438">Russian would be again correct. </sentence><sentence id="439">And, of course, he was fluent in his Polish, and here I'm going to make a point. </sentence><sentence id="440">They asked if anybody has pictures from the past to be a sort of identification to show when we meet up with this here <span class="building">AK underground</span> or <span class="building">Polish underground</span>, that's sort of to prove that we are authentic. </sentence><sentence id="441">So he had a picture in uniform as an officer cadet, and that was while graduating his officers" <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">Which in other times, that would give him -- in <span class="populated place">London</span>, and is a ticket to be arrested and sent to <span class="country">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">And this time, it served the purpose very well, and he could show it off. </sentence><sentence id="444">So we were four of us from the locals, Surgay (ph) and another guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian, and I and then it was Polotchik (ph).So the rest eight of them, including the commander of our group, were all easterners, as we call them or referred to them, or paratroopers that were dropped. </sentence><sentence id="445">And they are disguised to say that they joined the Polish Army in protest against the Communists and, therefore, they're willing to give their life to fight with the Polish for the cause, that they are anti- Communist. </sentence><sentence id="446">So it sort of was a supportive kind of thing, and every one of us was made up like the documents, so it was really produced like in legal kind of a manner and way. </sentence><sentence id="447">And once we crossed the <span class="env feature">Niemen</span>, we started to go on the other side and we made our way up <span class="region">south</span>, sort of that we knew in certain <span class="region">areas</span> that there were more white Poles that were operating by night as partisans. </sentence><sentence id="448">By day, they were doing their regular work be as farmers, or whatever their work took. </sentence><sentence id="449">And from talking and inquiries, we found out to make the contact to somebody, and we all, therefore, did not go in. </sentence><sentence id="450">But it was just <span class="populated place">Surgay</span> -- per se, it used to be <span class="populated place">Surgay</span> and the commander or two would go in from the easterners, or rather the paratroopers. </sentence><sentence id="451">And I or would be in there because it's supportive evidence to carry on  0 around like in a <span class="spatial object">barrel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="452">You couldn't stretch out, and that was part of it. </sentence><sentence id="453">In our weapons we had at that time we had some automatic and the majority was end-shooters, automatic pistols and so on. </sentence><sentence id="454">So we didn't show a lot of weapons we'd ask for, for whatever reason it was. </sentence><sentence id="455">And on one of these here occasions, it must have been maybe the third day and we used to were trained and told that whenever you entered a <span class="building">Polish house</span>, you're going to have to cross heart, you have to kneel to say your prayers. </sentence><sentence id="456">You had show the whole rigmarole that it looks like authentic, and you cannot go away. </sentence><sentence id="457">And this is what it was, the Polish system and the Polish star, and all of us including myself as much as it hurt me to say some of those words. </sentence><sentence id="458">But for lifesaving idea, you do a lot of things that you ask forgiveness, you know, in your <span class="interior space">heart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="459">But you do it in order to survive and I did it. </sentence><sentence id="460">Again, it was the food eating kind, it's they were serving pork and more pork. </sentence><sentence id="461">And to us, it was a novelty of having this food served because it was not like that. </sentence><sentence id="462">They went their normal way. </sentence><sentence id="463">And drinking, of course, rum. </sentence><sentence id="464">One of these nights we then first had to say our prayer. </sentence><sentence id="465">We sat behind the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, drinking had started with moonshine and Polish Vodka, you know, that some of it was shown to us. </sentence><sentence id="466">And the host which was sitting across like from me at a <span class="spatial object">table</span>, and he says in Polish, " i  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: ... Polish. </sentence><sentence id="507">That's different than within your group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="510">A: Yes, but I was talking to him one-on-one at this particular time, and he understood it and he joined with me. </sentence><sentence id="511">And from there on until the end of that mission ended, which we were traveling around and we were already nearing the <span class="region">area</span> in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> near <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="512">But the fact remains that while our command suspected that the Polish partisans and the National Polish partisans where a resistance became very understandable to us, and they are visible. </sentence><sentence id="513">And they had an easier way of operating because they did not have -- you know, the Germans did not know who, what and where. </sentence><sentence id="514">For as long as the population didn't tell about you, bring you up, you were operating safe. </sentence><sentence id="515">So they could be where they are, do what they want to, and manage to stay away, not to be -- maybe there are people <span class="country">Poland</span> in the militia. </sentence><sentence id="516">It could be possible, I don't -- I don't doubt that a bit, but since I don't know the facts exactly, I don't wish to dwell on it too much. </sentence><sentence id="517">Until finally our mission ended, it was about 10 days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: Let's stop for a second. ( </sentence><sentence id="527">noise) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: As easily I talk about it after that, that it ensued and happened at that time, I hope you get my understanding. </sentence><sentence id="531">That every minute of the day was a hard minute to pass because we were really watching ourselves against two enemies. </sentence><sentence id="532">You never know did the Polish really take us for granted or didn't they? </sentence><sentence id="533">And again, let's not forget the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: It doesn't sound like it's getting quieter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: The 10 days of agony really is not worthy enough a word to use as I said describing our ordeal what we had go through. </sentence><sentence id="541">Being dressed in a Polish uniform, acting something that we are not, and all that rigmarole going through with it, prayers. </sentence><sentence id="542">Not I nor the Gentiles in our group were praying type of people in those days at all. </sentence><sentence id="543">Especially being from the <span class="region">Soviet side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="544">So all this here was -- I don't know to say what it was the worst part of it. </sentence><sentence id="545">But one thing which I did not say it, and I want to tell it. </sentence><sentence id="546">I disclosed the situation to the commander of our group. </sentence><sentence id="547">In another word way, I spoke to <span class="populated place">Polotchik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">I says, "You know," I didn't want to use because of it, "I don't mind it to stay outside any time that we go into a <span class="building">house</span> or anything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="549">In other words, to be on patrol." </sentence><sentence id="550">And that was a well-taken word because this is the worst you can ask for, to be on patrol. </sentence><sentence id="551">In case of trouble, you're the first one to die. </sentence><sentence id="552">So they didn't mind it, and especially these guys inside, it will be a drink and so on. </sentence><sentence id="553">And I did not mind it at all to forsake it. </sentence><sentence id="554">And our mission, as Polish partisans, was nearing and we politely took our uniforms off, burned them so there should be no recognition or anything like that whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="555">And now, we ensued to find a new place, to find is there any partisans at all in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="556">We ran up on a place in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, what they called it 5  2 seeing they were using that as a hiding place, they were very cautious and careful to have us come in over there. </sentence><sentence id="557">We needed a guide at that particular time to know the <span class="region">area</span>, and we found two of the Jewish people over there who knew the <span class="region">area</span> exactly well. </sentence><sentence id="558">And they did not mind to become our guides and be with us for the period that we were. </sentence><sentence id="559">Our mission was at that time, once we turned back in as Soviet partisans, to show the Germans that there are partisans over here. </sentence><sentence id="560">And how could we show it to the Germans or see what kind of reaction comes from them? </sentence><sentence id="561">We went downing a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> in a few places that we had to cut on the <span class="dlf">posts</span>, just cut the <span class="dlf">wires</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="562">And at one time, we used a new system that we tried. </sentence><sentence id="563">We had already the plastic explosives where we would take and wrap it around so no longer did we have to use a saw to cut it down. </sentence><sentence id="564">But we would wrap around this here and put in a <span class="spatial object">capsule</span>, and from distance turn on -- from distance, turn it on and by one shot, the whole <span class="spatial object">post</span>, the <span class="spatial object">telephone post</span>, would blow up in the <span class="dlf">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">And devise to make it was disrupted, so to us, it was sort of like a fiasco, something we never experienced before in an action. </sentence><sentence id="566">And that's why it was progress that we have seen in a different way of doing those things. </sentence><sentence id="567">Because you could set it off very easily, in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="568">Just to wrap around, around the <span class="env feature">tree</span>, you know, with a piece the explosive and blow up, in other words, a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> like this here. </sentence><sentence id="569">So that was our mission at that time and we did accomplish. </sentence><sentence id="570">We also had a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to go by <span class="dlf">rails</span> that we where to explode some <span class="dlf">rail</span>, <span class="spatial object">train</span> about it to do. </sentence><sentence id="571">So that was the three things that we were involved in doing: Cutting down the <span class="spatial object">telephone poles</span>, disrupting communication, also burned down a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> which it was a connecting small <span class="dlf">bridge</span> in a side <span class="dlf">road</span> and -- which it was leading to a <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">And also, blow up some <span class="dlf">rail</span>, which it was -- when I think about blowing up the <span class="dlf">rail</span>, when I think about it, I still shudder. </sentence><sentence id="573">Because we came to that mission, and we really the night before did a lot of drinking. </sentence><sentence id="574">And while the drinking didn't bother me in most cases, at this time -- but all of a sudden, while they used at that particular time, they used to call it a <span class="building">shuntle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575">This was the rod to clean out your rifles with, and we had to put it in that fender ring so that would serve for the right <span class="spatial object">train</span>, and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> would go by as to be able to go ahead to touch it and make an explosion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: Let's stop here a second. </sentence><sentence id="613">Don't move. </sentence><sentence id="614">Do you remember where we were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="618">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="619">As I started to tell you, with my long coat, we were wearing army coats, which they were long coats at that time. </sentence><sentence id="620">We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the Russian Army, so this sort of did not have them with us, but we got them. </sentence><sentence id="621">And I'll tell you when. </sentence><sentence id="622">How they got them, I don't even know to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="623">But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="624">Not fully, but almost. </sentence><sentence id="625">And all of a sudden, I saw that I attached the piece of steel or rather wire, that it was in between that <span class="dlf">ring</span> which that was the one to trigger it for an explosion. </sentence><sentence id="626">I saw it there, and I don't know -- I didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="627">Should we run or whatever we should do, some kind of a motion, because -- and calmly we went away. </sentence><sentence id="628">Looks like all the other Jew, there were three of us over there. </sentence><sentence id="629">The other two had seen it at the same time, and we retreated and we went away. </sentence><sentence id="630">Now, we did it like we used to before in other places. </sentence><sentence id="631">We retreated about maybe a half a mile away into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and we were waiting for a passing <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">Whenever, we did not have a schedule, and the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> in those years did not run on schedule either. </sentence><sentence id="633">Because <span class="spatial object">military trains</span> had priority and the other priority, which I know it now and I did not know it then, was <span class="spatial object">trains</span> carrying Jews to the  3 <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="634">They were the priority number one almost like the <span class="spatial object">army trains</span> at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="635">So -- and we heard a <span class="spatial object">train</span> in about an hour later, and we were just retreating waiting because we wanted to know the damage. </sentence><sentence id="636">On the other hand, we couldn't even find out where the damage was. </sentence><sentence id="637">So we heard an explosion, so we scored our three-way things that we had. </sentence><sentence id="638">We had a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> blown up, we did that. </sentence><sentence id="639">We had the <span class="spatial object">train</span> which we had accomplished that. </sentence><sentence id="640">The damage what it was, we did not even wait, we retreated from there immediately upon the explosion towards the <span class="env feature">forest</span> because we were not too well familiar with the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="641">But we had a map of the <span class="region">local area</span> that we obtained, and military map which we knew whereabouts we have to aim because we did not accept to go ahead to ask people our ways around, because we couldn't trust anybody. </sentence><sentence id="642">So all in all, we found out that we knew about this group of people who were in hiding which was like a <span class="populated place">family camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">Special partisans, we didn't make contact with any of them. </sentence><sentence id="644">And we started through a different <span class="dlf">route</span> now to go back to our <span class="building">bases</span> on the other side of the <span class="populated place">Niemen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="645">We decided at this time to go in our way without horseback riding as we were going this way, so we knew it's going to be a long haul to it. </sentence><sentence id="646">And it took us -- well, it took us 10 days to go to the mission, we didn't see it. </sentence><sentence id="647">It took us two weeks until we finally came to the <span class="env feature">Niemen River</span> near our <span class="region">area</span>, and we had to get somebody with a little <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and a gun that we met, a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="648">We had a little <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that he had, a <span class="spatial object">canoe</span> more or less, to get us across on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="649">Seeing that there were 12, it was impossible for all of us to go in. </sentence><sentence id="650">So we spread out like a few guy with machine guns around both <span class="region">sides</span> in case of attack, and once we landed on the other side, we were doing -- the same group was doing for the others. </sentence><sentence id="651">To take cover until we were all on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="652">There we were on our own terms, we knew our ways around, and we finally came to our place where <span class="populated place">camp</span> was set before. </sentence><sentence id="653">And our <span class="populated place">camp</span> was still there because we were prepared that, who know, maybe we did not have no <span class="spatial object">telephones</span> or any communications to know what animals. </sentence><sentence id="654">But it so happened that everything was in place . </sentence><sentence id="655">And of course, our commander did his  4 <span class="spatial object">pontoon</span>, sort of like. </sentence><sentence id="656">And our five guys to go through across, and it was set up right away alongside that <span class="dlf">perimeter</span> at that time to be ready for attack. </sentence><sentence id="657">All we were wondering where the <span class="building">police</span> or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="658">The amount of so much armor that we had and the amount of so many people all gathered at one time on both sides of the <span class="env feature">Niemen River</span> as it happened, because we went through. </sentence><sentence id="659">It would have taken us too long to get through all of it in one spot, so in various <span class="dlf">perimeters</span>, we used so many people to get across the other side of the Niemen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="704">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="705">We were crossing at this particular time, I with my group at that time were crossing near the <span class="populated place">City Lida</span>. </sentence><sentence id="706">And <span class="populated place">Lida</span> is very -- I would say, kilometer-wise at that particular time, it must have been maybe 30 or 40 kilometers, no more, to <span class="populated place">Lida</span> that the <span class="dlf">crossing</span> was taking place. </sentence><sentence id="707">And as we came on the other side, we were given horses and <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, which they were confiscated from farmers and we were going just like a regular army would go. </sentence><sentence id="708">Some of them, we would be walking, but when we were walking, we were not marching scattered out. </sentence><sentence id="709">We were walking in a four across, but it was not next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="710">We were walking so much between each other that if we had to drop, take a position military style, that we were able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: They wanted to show a big force. </sentence><sentence id="721">While previous times they did not want to show -- you go a group of 12, a group of 20, the biggest missions in the partisans were achieved with small groups unless an attack on a <span class="building">garrison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="722">So right now they wanted -- you know, people exaggerate. </sentence><sentence id="723">When they see 1,200, I'm sure that the word got around that it was probably a force of 2,000 to maybe 3,000. </sentence><sentence id="724">It's a usual way people repeat something like that, it looks bigger. </sentence><sentence id="725">And the command by all price, wanted at that particular time to show a big force. </sentence><sentence id="726">And we were going and we were not stopped or disrupted in any way while we were going at that time through <span class="env feature">forests</span>. </sentence><sentence id="727">We didn't go through -- but the newest we had guys on horses to spot in <span class="populated place">settlements</span>, to find out the reaction, what people are talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="728">And they were filling us in that the militia was fleeing small <span class="building">garrisons</span> or small militia places, because to them it looked like a breakthrough from the <span class="dlf">front line</span>, and it looks like they landed over here. </sentence><sentence id="729">In <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span>, at that particular time -- <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> is a big <span class="populated place">city</span> and it was maybe 120, 150 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="730">They were on ready massed two full divisions equipped to go to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>, and they took these few divisions and threw it at us. </sentence><sentence id="731">So we did not even have enough time to get situated in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="732">Which it was on day three, all of a sudden, <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> above and what the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> did, the bombs -- was gasoline bombs. </sentence><sentence id="733">So the <span class="env feature">forest</span> became on fire. </sentence><sentence id="734">Something that it was never done before. ( </sentence><sentence id="735">A) The Germans never bombed the <span class="env feature">forest</span> with <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>; second, with this type of gasoline bombs. </sentence><sentence id="736">So these gasoline bombs made so much panic that we did not know -- it didn't matter whether on a <span class="spatial object">compass</span> or the <span class="spatial object">map</span>, which way you're going. </sentence><sentence id="737">Because you went to the right, you see more <span class="env feature">forests</span> on fire. </sentence><sentence id="738">And with all of this here, by the time that day was over, we were an army demolished in a way. </sentence><sentence id="739">Not from killing, but in small groups. </sentence><sentence id="740">And any of the light armaments like we had the light artillery pieces  5 were all left and mined and a new retreat back started in a new fashion in small groups. </sentence><sentence id="741">End of tape #1  6 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="764">Q: When did this take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="766">A: This I remember quite well because it was in December because coming back we know the <span class="env feature">ice</span> on the <span class="env feature">Niemen River</span>, there were floating pieces of ice. </sentence><sentence id="767">And I know the time because Christmastime is a visible part, that I remember because it was a big, important thing to remember. </sentence><sentence id="768">But a big disaster happened to us at that time. </sentence><sentence id="769">I do not want to omit a very important story personally that I ensued on that day before the total <span class="building">retreat</span> had started. </sentence><sentence id="770">I was laid out with my platoon in <span class="dlf">front line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="771">And when I say, "platoon," I'm talking about 20- something guys. </sentence><sentence id="772">And all we had was two live machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="773">The one on the <span class="spatial object">tripod</span> with a round base was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="774">And the other one was a similar one. </sentence><sentence id="775">In other words, we had 10 shooter rifles. </sentence><sentence id="776">All of a sudden, we heard the roar of <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="777">So the roar of <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, all of that had happened before the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> showed up on the scene. </sentence><sentence id="778">I jumped a little bit the gun before. </sentence><sentence id="779">When I heard the roar of <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, I sent one of my guys to tell to the commander of his that it's noticeable, the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, and what have I got -- what kind of change of command, let's say, new position. </sentence><sentence id="780">Because I told him I don't even have in my platoon one entire armored gun to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="781">So what with rifles, how am I going to shoot against them? </sentence><sentence id="782">And as they became closer, I decided to retreat on my own way without a command, and I went to the commander and told him, I says, "Look, there is infantry walking alongside the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, and there is at least visible from distance, I had someone climb up on a <span class="env feature">tree</span>, and they saw at least six <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="783">Because how far can you see, you know what I mean without field glasses or so on. </sentence><sentence id="784">So I says, "I know you probably did not have a chance so I retreated." </sentence><sentence id="785">He says, "How dare you to retreat; we didn't tell you." </sentence><sentence id="786">I says, "Do you think we're going to be able fight against this force? </sentence><sentence id="787">With this, you don't have a chance." </sentence><sentence id="788">It didn't take another minute or two while we were talking, a guy running come in and says, "We are all ordered not to open fire, but we'll retreat. </sentence><sentence id="789">We'll retreat in a position like we came to the force away from where we were laid up alongside that <span class="dlf">road</span>." </sentence><sentence id="790">And as soon nightfall came, my commander brought me into the <span class="building">high command</span> to stand <span class="dlf">trail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="791">I almost thought I am going to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="792">How dare was I to take and retreat my platoon on my own? </sentence><sentence id="793">My thing was since I had no ammunition, which it was a fact, to even attack a <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, why was I to disclose our position? </sentence><sentence id="794">We would wind up we would have suffered a lot of casualties. </sentence><sentence id="795">It looks like command saw my plea much better than my immediate commander from the company, and was case dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="796">But I was afraid that that was curtains for me at that particular time because I did it on my own. </sentence><sentence id="797">As it turned out to be later, I was allowed, of course, that I made a good decision by retreating my platoon to them. </sentence><sentence id="798">Seeing that the command would have come to me anyhow a few minutes later. </sentence><sentence id="799">So then after the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> showed on the scene, which it was closer to the afternoon already, and so far they did not start shooting directly. </sentence><sentence id="800">But all of a sudden, it burst out cannon shooting, which probably it was from the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> approaching. </sentence><sentence id="801">Although we, by that time, were retreated from the <span class="region">area</span> because that looked like the whole <span class="env feature">forest</span> was going along the main <span class="dlf">road</span> and the main <span class="dlf">road</span> going, I mean, going through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="802">Not a regular <span class="dlf">road</span> to outside. </sentence><sentence id="803">And the <span class="dlf">roads</span> in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> were <span class="dlf">dirt roads</span> as we can best way express it. </sentence><sentence id="804">But their <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, you see, could go through these <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="805">And wherever they stepped on <span class="env feature">trees</span>, they stepped on <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">They made their own <span class="dlf">roads</span> out. </sentence><sentence id="807">That night the command told us that we are not going to  7 ensue fighting. </sentence><sentence id="808">We are going to retreat back to our <span class="building">base</span>. </sentence><sentence id="809">We do not want to go in groups of more than 10 because groups more than 10 will require too much exposure. </sentence><sentence id="810">And we were to march only by night, and if anyone is caught or whatever it is, it's -- you know what I mean, you're just running. </sentence><sentence id="811">Cannot tell them our mission or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="812">However, we were all asked that each one of us carry at this time more ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="813">So each of them were loaded up with more ammunition on ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="814">We walked and we came there, all right? </sentence><sentence id="815">And only thing was in favor was that it wasn't snowing at that time. </sentence><sentence id="816">It was just cold, but it wasn't snowing. </sentence><sentence id="817">And food became a problem because as we went through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, we found blueberries or anything, we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until finally a few days later and closer to our <span class="region">areas</span>, that's when we began to go eat. </sentence><sentence id="818">When we came near the <span class="building">Niemen</span>, and our group to go across which it was -- I was 10 men or 12.1 believe it was about 12 men with me. </sentence><sentence id="819">And there was another group divided for not so many. </sentence><sentence id="820">Each that we were walking away from each other, but not too far a distance that we couldn't contact with each other. </sentence><sentence id="821">In case a fight ensues, that we could depend on the other one to help us. </sentence><sentence id="822">Either flank them or they would flank us. </sentence><sentence id="823">And when we came to the Niemen, we heard shots coming from all sides which later on, we discovered it was our own guys who were patrolling that <span class="region">area</span> of the edge of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> near the Niemen that they did not know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="824">And they thought sort of maybe the Poles, the AK, are trying to come on this side. </sentence><sentence id="825">Because they didn't look like an army, and, therefore, they fired the shots. </sentence><sentence id="826">A few casualties were done, nothing is done to my platoon but some of the others. </sentence><sentence id="827">And the order was we grabbed horses at that time from farmers, and anybody who was carrying a machine gun was allowed to sit on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="828">Alongside the horse, some other guys were swimming along, because pieces of <span class="env feature">ice</span> were floating on that <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="829">And by the time I came over on the other side of the <span class="dlf">Niemen</span>, I managed one thing to do, not to stop. </sentence><sentence id="830">It became so the whole uniform that I was dressed in, I became like a walking <span class="env feature">mountain</span> of <span class="env feature">ice</span>. </sentence><sentence id="831">But I was aware of myself, I kept sort of seeing that I'm alive and keep walking as well as I could until finally reached the first <span class="building">farmhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="832">When I came into the first <span class="building">farmhouse</span>, I found plenty more partisans who did probably like myself. </sentence><sentence id="833">The woman of the <span class="building">house</span> availed herself tremendously, and in that <span class="region">area</span> people used to have <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> which served them in their <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="834">That <span class="spatial object">oven</span> was cooking, for baking as well as for heat. </sentence><sentence id="835">And on top, there was a place even to climb up and to sleep there. </sentence><sentence id="836">And since I had to get undressed, she gave me a change of something and put my clothing to dry out. </sentence><sentence id="837">There was moonshine there to drink, so we had a good drink. </sentence><sentence id="838">And on top of that <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, I climbed on. </sentence><sentence id="839">I fell asleep, needless to say, and by later on by morning -- that was the <span class="region">wooded area</span>, so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as far as Germans were concerned, the police. </sentence><sentence id="840">And we started to make our way back to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="841">So that was from a happy occasion as we marched as soldiers and brave guys to make it believe that it was a breakthrough, all of a sudden, for Christmas it was our dire moment that we did not succeed. </sentence><sentence id="842">However, command did not stop with their idea. </sentence><sentence id="843">What they did at this time instead of sending a big group and an army like they did, we were moving in the same amount of people while we were retreating. </sentence><sentence id="844">In small groups, no bigger companies than 20 people at one time were ordered where in a direction to meet in the <span class="env feature">forests</span> around <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">And within, I would say, maybe two weeks to three weeks, we had a brand new force organized in the <span class="env feature">forests</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="846">The <span class="dlf">front line</span> -- by that time, I'm talking about in January of 1944 -- the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> began to become visible. </sentence><sentence id="847">That the Byelorussian, that they  8 were almost at the beginning in January of "44, that the army were entering in certain spots in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span> and in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="848">And we did not realize that within six, seven months, the army will be here. </sentence><sentence id="849">We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near, we would sort of be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="850">But that was not <span class="country">Russia</span>'s idea or the Soviets saying -- we were at that particular time pushed to go closer to <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">They had already their assignment. </sentence><sentence id="852">I remember vividly that the night before when I went to place a <span class="dlf">mine</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span> -- at that particular time we used a lot <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">We, you know, even used mines to put on the <span class="dlf">road</span> because the retreating soldiers by the Soviet Army, we did not think that the Red Army is close by. </sentence><sentence id="854">And I believe that that blowup of that <span class="dlf">mine</span>, that it exploded on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> that we found out the next day was already that the Red Army is reaching. </sentence><sentence id="855">I jumped right now -- at least about eight, nine months. </sentence><sentence id="856">In the <span class="region">area</span> where my wife was and the <span class="region">area</span> from originally I was with the partisans, they came out of the <span class="env feature">forests</span> about July, early August. </sentence><sentence id="857">I, as I said, still we were involved with all of this here things, did not get discharged out of that until sometime in September. </sentence><sentence id="858">And a new mission was awaiting for me to get started because immediately it was for 10 days that we were -- that the army was fighting the battle. </sentence><sentence id="859">On one side, the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="860">And the other <span class="region">side</span>, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="861">A lot of Germans were left behind for purposes. </sentence><sentence id="862">They had the high <span class="building">churches</span> as usual in the <span class="region">north</span>. </sentence><sentence id="863">And on top of these <span class="building">churches</span>, they found them -- they placed themselves with glasses and they were able to tell the other side where the <span class="spatial object">artillery</span> is located to how we are to load firing. </sentence><sentence id="864">And their accuracy was beyond belief. </sentence><sentence id="865">On the third round, they knocked the battery out. </sentence><sentence id="866">To the right, to the left, the <span class="spatial object">turbine</span> was in the center and your <span class="spatial object">battery</span> is all to pieces like . </sentence><sentence id="867"> 9 the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> became reaching, the closer we used to see <span class="spatial object">Soviet airplanes</span> in the <span class="dlf">air</span> flying through because we used to begin to see them now flying through our missions to bomb or so on. </sentence><sentence id="868">It sort of put in a new <span class="dlf">hole</span> in life. </sentence><sentence id="869">It was still being possible to believe that really the <span class="dlf">front lines</span> are coming closer to us and the Soviets are returning. </sentence><sentence id="870">It was only like everybody had one prayer, that we would live to see that. </sentence><sentence id="871">Because a new way had started in all this force over there. </sentence><sentence id="872">While we were a way closer to <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, as I said, in small groups that we were asked to come to this end. </sentence><sentence id="873">We must have had a force of about 800 partisans over there in various places. </sentence><sentence id="874">The old <span class="region">territory</span> from where we descended sort of from, right now began to fill up with retreating Germans. </sentence><sentence id="875">And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here last month of the war as they did in two and a half years prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="876">Because first of all, the army was afraid to retreat by the regular open <span class="dlf">road</span>, so they used the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="877">When they were going through the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, there was no holy places for them as special by any army. </sentence><sentence id="878">And they had their equipment, and, of course, the partisans could not help it. </sentence><sentence id="879">If they ensued in a little fight, the Germans did not stop with a fight because to them regrouping and retreating was more important. </sentence><sentence id="880">So maybe a fight would ensue, they would look the <span class="dlf">opening</span> where they could do the best and get out. </sentence><sentence id="881">So that gave the partisans sort of another way of running away. </sentence><sentence id="882">But there was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to escape. </sentence><sentence id="883">And the biggest amount, my best friends that I was to through the years were killed in the last -- in these here ensuing battles of that time. </sentence><sentence id="884">I came out -- as a matter of fact, not to jump it. </sentence><sentence id="885">When the Red Army neared our places, one of the companies -- when the commander came, I was assigned at that time to be in the other staff. </sentence><sentence id="886">And he came to telling the staff that the Red Army came and took away his men. </sentence><sentence id="887">They need to refuse, where he in all kind of language stated to me, "Who is your commander? </sentence><sentence id="888">Am I your commander? </sentence><sentence id="889">Am I the staff, or the guy in the Red Army?What right did you have?" </sentence><sentence id="890">And he used them -- all the language to them, "I don't care how you get your men back. </sentence><sentence id="891">If they have to <span class="env feature">desert</span>, let them <span class="env feature">desert</span>. </sentence><sentence id="892">I want you to go and get your men back." </sentence><sentence id="893">To his dismay, he couldn't keep up -- find his men. </sentence><sentence id="894">And this is a whole chaos at that time existed, and until we finally came out on the outside after the 10 days" battle that had ensued around the Niemen until the Russians break through. </sentence><sentence id="895">And after the encirclement, like I said, you see, we were asked to come outside. </sentence><sentence id="896">What the partisans at that particular time were asked to do was to keep going over on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and keep a vigil on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="897">At that particular time we weren't -- did not have yet the order. </sentence><sentence id="898">As soon we found Germans hiding or anything and they surrendered, we didn't obey by the law. </sentence><sentence id="899">We would take them out in the <span class="dlf">field</span> and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="900">Of course, and take the ammunition away from them. </sentence><sentence id="901">So no sooner, a few days all of that went on, there was an order issued that the partisans are no longer to kill the Germans who are surrendering, because it's against the law. </sentence><sentence id="902">It was bring them -- and a <span class="populated place">camp</span> was started with POWs. </sentence><sentence id="903">It was sort of a defeating purpose to us, that command, but we had to obey the order. </sentence><sentence id="904">And immediately the Soviets started to -- at that particular time, they were probably in the <span class="interior space">front levels</span> maybe two, three days. </sentence><sentence id="905">But they already had the administration mapped out to what <span class="building">offices</span> each <span class="building">building</span> would be located. </sentence><sentence id="906">And before long, they started taking to service the local population. </sentence><sentence id="907">The population was ordered that anybody between the ages of 21 to 55 is to register in an <span class="building">induction center</span> to go back into service. </sentence><sentence id="908">The local population, which I'm speaking of at that place in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, were Polish. </sentence><sentence id="909">That was not a part of <span class="populated place">Byelorussia</span>, that was part of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="910">And that's the last thing that was on their mind is to be going, riding out to be taken to go do soldiering for the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="911">The hate still was  0 imbedded in them, so it was embedded all the way, you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="912">So my new assignment was that I had to form a new platoon because a lot of them already went out in the open and got jobs as accountants or whatever it is in the civilian life, and they were discharged from this staff, which it was also in one of the <span class="building">buildings</span> inside <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="913">For my luck, I did it. </sentence><sentence id="914">Firstly, I had a big dilemma with myself. </sentence><sentence id="915">I could not face the outside. </sentence><sentence id="916">To me, the outside was atrocious. </sentence><sentence id="917">It was fearful. </sentence><sentence id="918">And second of all, I was afraid once I go out, they're taking away my gun. </sentence><sentence id="919">To me, the <span class="spatial object">gun</span> was my life; it was my protection. </sentence><sentence id="920">It was everything I wanted, that's how I was. </sentence><sentence id="921">So one of the guys would come to me that he was a .too. </sentence><sentence id="922">He was an accountant by trade. </sentence><sentence id="923">And he says, "Herr, what is the matter with you?" </sentence><sentence id="924">It was hard for me to describe -- was his name. </sentence><sentence id="925">He wrote a book in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="926">To the  1 because we had to bring the inductees about 60, 70 miles away to another <span class="populated place">city</span> which it's called <span class="populated place">Monastyrok</span>. </sentence><sentence id="927">Because the <span class="dlf">railroads</span> were totally disrupted; the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> did not go any further than <span class="populated place">Monastyrok</span>. </sentence><sentence id="928">And so we mustered and within a few days a nice few thousand, maybe over 5, 6,000 and we put them in rows. </sentence><sentence id="929">We had to march to get them out from the <span class="building">induction center</span> with bayonets. </sentence><sentence id="930">And the women and children and everybody was like a demonstration. </sentence><sentence id="931">They're crying over why their men are taken from them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="932">And some of them tried to pay off. </sentence><sentence id="933">I knew from the <span class="dlf">grapevine</span> that one of my platoon guys, because he later came and asked me. </sentence><sentence id="934">And I told him that "If you talk to me again about bribe, I'm going to have you arrested." </sentence><sentence id="935">So I don't want to hear about and I don't know -- so he understood that I don't want to be involved, but I wouldn't to hear. </sentence><sentence id="936">He was a Jewish boy from my platoon, and I sort of see and don't see, you know, and don't know. </sentence><sentence id="937">But whatever he wanted to do, he went. </sentence><sentence id="938">And a lot of them what they did, they would write on a piece of paper that you have this list. </sentence><sentence id="939">That period was mostly that you show up in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, they'll take him, but they wouldn't induct him again. </sentence><sentence id="940">So what he did, in the meanwhile, they got someone that will give you watches; someone will give you gold pieces and so on. </sentence><sentence id="941">I did not want to be a party to all of that, as I aforementioned. </sentence><sentence id="942">We loaded them into <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and we went as far the old <span class="dlf">border</span> of the <span class="dlf">Soviet/Polish border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="943">Over there, the military KGB took over and I was given papers to go back. </sentence><sentence id="944">I would say this would finalize this part of the chapter, and after that we're going have to talk about the liberation and what had happened in the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

25 minutes? </sentence><sentence id="1131">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1132">For me again, a human life had started with papers from the Soviet government written in it that every place I show up with my platoon, no matter how many I have, the head of this location of <span class="populated place">settlement</span> is to provide me with my men, food, and shelter and a place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1133">The <span class="spatial object">trains</span> at that particular time were all the military. </sentence><sentence id="1134">It was a <span class="building">high court</span> to get you something, a <span class="spatial object">passenger train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So we didn't care, whatever we could get on on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, for my whole platoon I remained with one Gentile boy. </sentence><sentence id="1136">Because I couldn't get hold him under any other circumstances, who was with me and I knew the <span class="dlf">farm place</span> from where he came from that he had a mother and sister. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And many times in the partisan life before I joined the paratroopers, we would stop off to his <span class="building">house</span> and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1138">So he was the only one, Nathan, the guy that I told you was his name who was the bad guy who was taking bribes, he, of course, realized the way I am. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So he wanted to lose me faster than I could go, I had to be lost. </sentence><sentence id="1140">So we went in different directions, and we finally ended up on a <span class="spatial object">military train</span> on the way to <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1141">From <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, if we get, we're going to work our way down further to go to his <span class="dlf">farm</span> or back to direction to see why we can wind up over there. </sentence><sentence id="1142">In the meanwhile while we are in that <span class="spatial object">military train</span>, I already in between time stopped off in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> was already liberated months and months before. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And I found out through the partisans that our main staff that was located in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> no longer is in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, but it's right now in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> located. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I went there to be registered and to get my validated things. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And I had to make another trip afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1147">The first thing I got up there was two medals that they gave  2 me. </sentence><sentence id="1148">One medal is for being a partisan, and the other medal was that I received at the time for being a heroic partisan. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So all of sudden, when I was on this <span class="spatial object">train</span> with Walodia (ph) together, I had the two medals. </sentence><sentence id="1150">He didn't get no medals or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1151">He only got the partisan validation, it looked like a medal that everyone was given in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1152">So when we got on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and that was a <span class="spatial object">military train</span>, within hours a guy comes over and I could recognize by his hat, that this color hats and so on belong to the NK VD, we used to call it at that time, which later turned to be KGB in due time later. </sentence><sentence id="1153">He got involved in conversation and he asked me for documents. </sentence><sentence id="1154">So I showed him the documents, firstly, these were given to me by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And the other documents that I already had on me for the medals was that I was a partisan, and he found very interesting to ask me. </sentence><sentence id="1156">He says, "I want to stay with you. </sentence><sentence id="1157">You're going to fill me in and tell me what took place in the partisans." </sentence><sentence id="1158">Because to him was a total new story that he heard about it that Stalin used to rob and , but he never heard or known what activities and what had went on. </sentence><sentence id="1159">So "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="1160">he asked me. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And I tried to say here, Walodia (ph) here has a mother because he was from the and a sister, and I at the same time want  3 <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Because actually it was harvest time at that time, we're talking about September at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The biggest harvest time in that <span class="region">area</span> which his mother having a small <span class="dlf">farm</span>, would have needed a hand. </sentence><sentence id="1164">There wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So it was a good reason that they didn't mind that. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And they let me go with him because I was going as sort of a farm hand to help him on his <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And at the same time, I just said I'll go. </sentence><sentence id="1168">So we got a date within two weeks to meet up back, I and the officer of the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And he and the <span class="building">office</span> of the local police or militia, as they were called. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And while I went -- I already arrived now, they issued me new papers because in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> you did not travel anyplace without having the justified papers. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And the justified papers weren't meaning a permit. </sentence><sentence id="1172">You see, at a time later on we had to get passports because you always had to have your ID with you. </sentence><sentence id="1173">But at the time, they gave me and Walodia papers that we can go to the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1174">You had to specify where you're going, who you're going to see, what you're going do about it. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And papers in hand, we had already on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> free <span class="dlf">passage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1176">No nothing like this here to go back to his <span class="dlf">farm</span> in his little -- which it was located not to far from <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1177">It was in a way sort of a happy journey for the first time for him. </sentence><sentence id="1178">The more I get freer and the more my eyes were seeing the free world, the more I became sort of shaken up. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I could not take freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1180">You did not have a psychiatrist at that time or a doctor to go to for help to help you overcome. </sentence><sentence id="1181">You just had to work it out. </sentence><sentence id="1182">When I came to his <span class="building">house</span>, his mother gave him a changeover and she gave me a changeover. </sentence><sentence id="1183">I was treated like part of the family, which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1184">A novelty item for survival from stuff like this here. </sentence><sentence id="1185">So we, of course, we had dinner and a few drinks, and afterwards, the two of us went out in the little -- it was a <span class="populated place">farm settlement</span>, maybe I would say, maybe 60 to 80 families. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And they all had <span class="dlf">farms</span>, small <span class="dlf">farms</span>, around there, and there with a harmonica, you know what I mean, dancing and drinking, which it was all a celebration. </sentence><sentence id="1187">After all, they got a hero back, Walodia, which he grew up in this here. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And I, being the former commander of Walodia, which I used to come as a partisan with Walodia a lot of times, so I knew enough people in his <span class="populated place">settlement</span> more than just his mother and so son. </sentence><sentence id="1189">We had another guy with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1250">Q: I don't know what this noise is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1252">A: Some of these little things that I forgot myself to take and put it in a <span class="interior space">drawer</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Yes, there was also a few more guys who were in our <span class="building">brigade</span> serving as partisans from the same <span class="populated place">settlement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And the other ones were inducted, while they would not be the paratroopers like we were. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Let's see, I was where? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1256">A: You were talking about you were at the <span class="populated place">settlement</span> and everyone was happy to see <span class="building">Walodia home</span> and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1258">Q: <span class="populated place">Walodia</span>, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So I said for this <span class="populated place">settlement</span> they saw two heroes, Walodia and me. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And the greetings they gave me almost made a change in my heart and soul of thinking the way my future is to go. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I went down so low as to say to myself I'm going to <span class="dlf">farm</span> with <span class="populated place">Walodia</span> and I'm going to forget any longer that I'm a Jew or was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1262">Because the greeting, the way I was received for the days ensuing, and that always went on a week's time. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Each morning I would go ahead with Walodia on his <span class="region">land</span> and it was harvest time, get involved with the  4 same thing he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1264">At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some drinking. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And I figured, hey, what the heck, that's the life to live. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I'll go back to all that sorrow, I thought maybe that's an escape for me. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Then comes Friday, Walodia says to me, "Harold, aren't you going to go into <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span> to see your Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="1268">And that struck me quick like a lightening went through my body, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1269">I says what am I thinking about going to become a non-Jew, and I immediately began to think you can run, but you cannot hide. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And his words to me about -- he didn't say, "Harold, how about going into <span class="populated place">town</span> and to see our partisans," because the Jews that he was making reference to were not survivors, they were partisans but they were in other companies or groups likely. </sentence><sentence id="1271">But they were basically with us in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1272">That issue for him saying Jews instead of partisans, it's like gave me a tremor in my body that no, that was not the way to think the way I was thinking those few days. </sentence><sentence id="1273">I'm going to probably become a Gentile and get married and forget about all that. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I said to him, "Oh, yes, <span class="populated place">Walodia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I was thinking to tell you about it, but I did not have the nerve of disrupting all that work that you have on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1276">But, please, whenever time will permit you, I would want to go in to visit." </sentence><sentence id="1277">And not using that word, "Jews," with out partisan friends, and not using it in singular, but using much rather plural. </sentence><sentence id="1278">However, I says, "Let us cross near the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span> of <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span> because I will ask sort of for you to make a stop there." </sentence><sentence id="1279">Because in that <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> I had both my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="1280">They still died before, no matter what the tribulations were as I was talking about, so they still were brought to burial there. </sentence><sentence id="1281">My father also was buried there. </sentence><sentence id="1282">So I sort of, like I say, was all of a sudden another person again. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And as we came to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, needless to say, that I could never see the <span class="spatial object">headstones</span> that were put because the <span class="spatial object">headstones</span> were desecrated by the <span class="region">local area</span> during that year, which they were made to <span class="dlf">sidewalks</span> and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So my trip was not fully in vain because at least I saw that not only were the local, the living destroyed and harassed, but even the dead did not have their peace to remain in peace in the places where they were placed there. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I did my share of crying, and all of a sudden, I was not a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1286">The killer, the partisan that I was, I became the Jew again. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Time was not running fast enough for me to come into <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span>, so I could meet up with some of my former mates that I was together in the group or being in the other group. </sentence><sentence id="1288">And I found the girls that I remembered that had rode with us, so they sort of cling together. </sentence><sentence id="1289">Nobody returned back into their <span class="building">homes</span>, but much rather in one's <span class="building">home</span>, the girls were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1290">So they were in one <span class="building">home</span>, the three girls were staying together. </sentence><sentence id="1291">One of the girls that I remembered when I was with , we sort  5 in the one <span class="building">house</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And we did not hear of any bad feelings about it for the returning partisans when they came to <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1293">A lot of them reclaimed their <span class="dlf">properties</span> without even going through the legal process. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Be that the Gentiles were fearful of invoking the law on them will hurt their future, or they did it as a gesture of their own, I would not be able to at this time to place judgment to tell you one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Because either way or both of things would have been accurate and assumption. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And I told them that I have undertaken a job in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, and I will look up our girls over there, the three of them, since I know now that they are in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, near. </sentence><sentence id="1297">So my stay over there was burning under my feet. </sentence><sentence id="1298">That whole epithet with Walodia bringing me back out of sort of, I don't want to use that word, that was a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1299">Because if it was a dream, I must have to call it a bad dream. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Or facing again the places of murder. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Seeing in the middle of the <span class="populated place">town</span> that for that short little time the partisans were there, they built a <span class="dlf">fence</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="1302">Painted up in white, and sort of put on an insignia to say that here are buried all those killed in the massacre of <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1303">You know, without knowing the amount or whatever it is and that sort of remained like a monument place that I believe I last heard of that it was a little bit improvement, more sign for that place. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say they were afraid to take them out to the big <span class="dlf">pits</span> that the Russian making because of the fear of the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1305">So we saw that the <span class="dlf">pits</span> filled up with lime on the top, that we whatever we are could find <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But the difference was now that I saw friends and I saw a sign telling who is buried underneath there. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1307">Q: You didn't have any family or. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: Of course, my brothers, my sister, my uncles, my aunts. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I had quite a big family which I don't till this day were they killed and burned inside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or were they brought out and killed in these <span class="dlf">holes</span> in the center of the <span class="populated place">town</span>, which they were led from the bombings when the war had started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1313">Q: No one left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1315">A: No, no one survived it. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I had my uncle which I mentioned who in my <span class="building">hideout</span> came, and he survived them and he came to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1317">He told me that my brother started to fight the police back and they didn't shoot him, but they beat him to death on the outside of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">So that's what I was told by him. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And what had happened the fate of where they were buried? </sentence><sentence id="1320">My uncle and my rest of the brothers and sisters, I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="1321">So perhaps maybe this is the bitterness in me over why I never cared to return to <span class="populated place">Debrecen</span> to face the evil. </sentence><sentence id="1322">To see the injustices the way people and that era, and with no one to turn to to their help or to their safety. </sentence><sentence id="1323">So I cut shorter even the time and then I returned to <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1324">When I returned to <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, I looked up those three girls. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Russa (ph) was the one you recollect in my conversation telling that she was the one taking care of that fuihrer. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And it  6 lives in one of the <span class="building">condos</span> in <span class="populated place">Boca</span>, which I've seen. </sentence><sentence id="1327">But she was living in <span class="populated place">New York</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="1328">So those three girls housed themselves together, and often they told me that they used to get Jewish guys as pilots or so coming to their <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1329">So all of a sudden, I was invited by them sort of to become a frequent visitor whenever I have time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Which when time permitted me, I was. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Now, I must step over to tell you another epithet which it happened while being in the <span class="populated place">NK VD</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1332">The <span class="building">NK VD</span> work, which it may sound odd in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> that it went on, really I had one payroll check, but I was doing the work of four. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I was a secretarial job. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I was the man in charge of the whole <span class="spatial object">auto</span> -- in other words, they had so many <span class="spatial object">autos</span> in the department, I was the one issuing for them gasoline tickets. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I was the one doing the accounting of consumption of all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And I also was the one responsible with another job that once a <span class="spatial object">Minsk car</span> would go to bring all kinds of stuff, be uniforms or whatever the department needed, which it was located in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1337">They kept it in <span class="populated place">Byelorussia</span>, so as I say -- and before the holidays so any roundups, I had to go duty as a KGB which I was assigned with maybe two more guys and go to the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1338">As the time of year it is, as I say, the war was not over in total as yet, because the war went on until about May the 7th or the 8th when it was declared the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="1339">So every time before a holiday was nearing, we used to have to go to search <span class="building">homes</span> and search passports and different documents. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Because we were told there are crime going on, and there are many people who resist the Soviet system because we used to give our political speeches. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And it's our job to go and turn all of these here criminals in. </sentence><sentence id="1342">On one of these here journeys, one day it happened I was again the head of the group, there were three of us. </sentence><sentence id="1343">I knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and then I'm jumping the gun because that happened already when I was married. </sentence><sentence id="1344">I got married in January of 1945, and, you know, we are quite a bit off yet. </sentence><sentence id="1345">We are still talking about September, you know, August, September, nearing October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1377">Q: Let's just stick with the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1379">A: So with that mission at that particular time, we were assigned to look for criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1380">What was the criminal? </sentence><sentence id="1381">Somebody who did not report to be inducted. </sentence><sentence id="1382">That was a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Everybody in their passport had to have a separate page stamped from the <span class="building">induction center</span> that he's released from induction because maybe he was not fit medically -- I mean, physically. </sentence><sentence id="1384">Maybe he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1385">There were other deficiencies, but on the passport if you did not have that stamp or that page proving to you that you were released from service becoming a soldier in other words, being inducted, you had to turn them in. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And believe me a lot of times maybe the people have fear, did not have the documents with them, and we used to round up so much time. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And then if they were questioned, they didn't find anything to hold them, they would let them out. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Now, that particular night I'm knocking on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I was first to knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And I keep telling them, I said, "Make the lights. </sentence><sentence id="1390">This is the <span class="building">KGB</span> coming for an inspection. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Everybody come out holding their passports ready for examination." </sentence><sentence id="1392">In it comes out a voice in Yiddish with Hebrew stating say, " ie  7 must go back to that place. </sentence><sentence id="1393">Find out who was that guy who was talking. </sentence><sentence id="1394">You know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="1395">So sure enough, the next day in the middle of the day I'm coming there in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I met him in there. </sentence><sentence id="1397">I says, "I was the guy last night. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Who was the one who said," "?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2020">Q: How far was <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span> from <span class="populated place">Chita</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2022">A: I would say in the kilometers way of saying, at least I would say about a hundred kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="2023">Because first of all, from her to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, we had to walk about 16 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="2024">It wasn't such an easy task, and believe it or not in those years, winter or not, we would walk from the <span class="building">train station</span> to her <span class="building">house</span> and, of course, I used to walk and keep my pistol open. </sentence><sentence id="2025">I mean, just in case. </sentence><sentence id="2026">But that was again what I said, the training from the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and gun on the side sort of made me satisfied that I worked for the <span class="building">KGB</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2027">Because I couldn't part with that <span class="spatial object">pistol</span> at that particular time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: When did you get married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2036">A: We got married January 5, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2037">After -- now, before I got married, I tried to ask -- because you had to fill out forms and write for permission to get married. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And since she was in her <span class="populated place">home town</span>, she couldn't come to me. </sentence><sentence id="2039">Since she was working in a place, a <span class="building">publishing place</span>  7 for the <span class="building">local paper</span>, so she was typesetter, and she couldn't get permission because there was no one to replace her. </sentence><sentence id="2040">I couldn't get permission because I was filling three, four jobs all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2041">So it was sort of we couldn't get to each other, so I was denied the third time after writing to get off. </sentence><sentence id="2042">After the third time denial, I did not ask anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2043">On a clear Monday -- but it was not so clear -- it was a stormy snow at that time in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, I decided to call her friend -- not the girlfriend that I aforementioned before, but the family, Briner (ph) was her name, to call on her because she was sort of trying to talk me into getting married sooner and that the better part of my life would have been improved and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2044">And we made a friendship sort of through that time through her friend who was living in the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2045">So I frequently used to come visiting with them so I could hear regards from Sonja and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2046">So I went over there to her, and I told her, I says, "Look, we are going tonight." " </sentence><sentence id="2047">What do you mean, Harold? </sentence><sentence id="2048">Did they give you permission?" </sentence><sentence id="2049">I says, "I have no permit. </sentence><sentence id="2050">We are going to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2051">We are going tonight to <span class="populated place">Chita</span> or <span class="populated place">Gettingen</span> (ph), so I did. </sentence><sentence id="2052">Snow or no snow, we came there. </sentence><sentence id="2053">We walked that walk all the way to the <span class="building">house</span>, and when I came into the <span class="building">house</span>, Sonja was by herself and she was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Why didn't I tell her before? </sentence><sentence id="2055">Her father would have been able to prepare. </sentence><sentence id="2056">I says, "Tell you what? </sentence><sentence id="2057">I couldn't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2058">But if I write to you a letter that I'm trying to go ahead and take off without a permit, you should understand better than that. </sentence><sentence id="2059">I came, it's tonight." </sentence><sentence id="2060">So the first thing she went running to find her father. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2061">Her father then was playing cards in another <span class="building">house</span>, and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And, of course, it was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="2063">He wouldn't permit me to go sleep with her, obviously, to say. </sentence><sentence id="2064">So we decided tomorrow, the following day, Tuesday, that we are going to go into -- it was called <span class="building">Zachs</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2065"><span class="building">Zachs</span> was the <span class="building">marriage license department</span> officially in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, so we went to make that official. </sentence><sentence id="2066">No sooner we got registered there and everything like that, I got a note to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2067">Because the guys that were former partisans were working in the <span class="building">KGB</span> here and with the police also the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2068">So they came quickly to the <span class="building">house</span> to tell me that they are not going to arrest me, but I have a warranty for my arrest and now that I came to the <span class="building">officialdom</span> -- everything was tied into the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2069">If you got married, the KGB got some of the knowledge about it, too, because that's how they controlled the population. </sentence><sentence id="2070">I being aware or not aware, I did it and I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="2071">I was the rebel at the time that I didn't care what's going tomorrow or the next hour. </sentence><sentence id="2072">So they said to me, "Harold, when do you decide to go back?" </sentence><sentence id="2073">I says, "I plan on going back Thursday, no later." </sentence><sentence id="2074">They say, "Okay, we'll cover you till Thursday, but Thursday you better get your fanny out of here because otherwise we got to arrest you." </sentence><sentence id="2075">Of course, it looks like the <span class="building">KGB</span> was notified officially after that where I am and that I'm on my way back and I'll be there. </sentence><sentence id="2076">And my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, gave me Vodka to take <span class="building">home</span> because he used to do <span class="building">black market</span> dealing. </sentence><sentence id="2077">He used to make the uppers for boots, and boots in those days was like a jeweler, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Everybody liked to have a pair of boots, and that gave him enough from the farmers who from making boots, that will would bring him all kinds of food in the <span class="building">house</span> so it was no shortage. </sentence><sentence id="2079">And before long he used to go into <span class="building">black marketeer</span> to get the other materials, leather and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2080">He would go to <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> or other places for the raw materials. </sentence><sentence id="2081">So she got him, and we already were married officially sort of the next morning because it was, and for that night we planned on a Tuesday night to plan to have an official Jewish ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="2082">So we got a hold the acting sort of rabbi, who was also a man who was in the partisans, but he was a blacksmith. </sentence><sentence id="2083">And through history we know there were blacksmith rabbis in the times of the sages, so it was a  8 . </sentence><sentence id="2084">However, it came to write exuba (ph), meaning the marital contract, he tells me he does not know how. </sentence><sentence id="2085">I says, "I do know how, but, you know, I was a student of that. </sentence><sentence id="2086">But it's illegitimate, you cannot write your own contract. </sentence><sentence id="2087">It must be fulfilled by somebody else." </sentence><sentence id="2088">So we decided just in his presence and the presence of witnesses to give hands and it became sort of a married <span class="building">officialdom</span> with all the other things, but without getting that official document, exuba (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2089">But officially we went through the whole -- and the guys were there, the former partisans, we had a <span class="building">house</span> party to celebrate our wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2090">But it was officially as it could be. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Legally and officially, although not for the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2092">So that's when we got married, and I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2093">For greetings when I came in, I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2094">I was asked to surrender my gun immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2095">The Commandant took me under arrest and charged me with desertion. </sentence><sentence id="2096">The thing, he put me into the <span class="building">jailhouse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2097">A few hours later, after two hours, no one other than the general himself is coming down. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And he says to him to the Commandant, "Why did you arrest him?" </sentence><sentence id="2099">So he said he did, he had the order for desertion, so he turned around to me. " </sentence><sentence id="2100">Would you please tell me what has transpired?" </sentence><sentence id="2101">I tell him, I says, "Three times I made applications filed through my boss that he knows for giving me permission to go and get married." </sentence><sentence id="2102">I says, "I thought getting married is constitutional. </sentence><sentence id="2103">However, I needed to do it in writing. </sentence><sentence id="2104">I did, I lived up to it and three times I was turned down. </sentence><sentence id="2105">So I got tired." </sentence><sentence id="2106">He says, "I got to put boss in <span class="building">jail</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2107">He says, "Get him out." </sentence><sentence id="2108">He says, "Not you." </sentence><sentence id="2109">I thanked him, and afterwards I said to the Commandant, "You see, I brought you salami and Vodka," and we turned it into sort of a festive mood. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And I went back to my <span class="building">office</span> to continue my work, and no charges whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2111">But at the same time I was fearful, so I left words with my father- in-law and discussed the issue of escape with him. </sentence><sentence id="2112">And I said to him, "Let's wait over a week or two. </sentence><sentence id="2113">And please go ahead under this and this name." </sentence><sentence id="2114">As I said at the outset of my recording that my birth name was Zuckerman. </sentence><sentence id="2115">I changed <span class="populated place">Zuckerman</span> to <span class="building">Zissman</span>; that's when the changing took place. </sentence><sentence id="2116">I registered because as Zissman, there was no one they can trace it to. </sentence><sentence id="2117">So I didn't care how long it will take them to find out who that Zissman is. </sentence><sentence id="2118">Rather that is the KGB problem, but I told them they send in my brother-in-law -- my present brother-in- law, he went in sort of to be the person and they knew him. </sentence><sentence id="2119">You know, in small <span class="populated place">towns</span> they knew each other, and my new name became -- as far as the Polish government was concerned, was Zissman and it was all changed. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And I was awaiting when the papers will be ready for them to let me know and I'll make the escape. </sentence><sentence id="2121">However, deep in me -- and I was called now to go ahead for duty at the <span class="building">office</span> of the general. </sentence><sentence id="2122">I was afraid that somebody's not playing and I said to my boss, I said, "Why are you sending me after all I committed?" </sentence><sentence id="2123">He says, "You were told already too many times. </sentence><sentence id="2124">When something's wrong, we'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2125">You have no reason for me to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2126">You asked to go for duty; you going to go up for the duty, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And ask yourself, I don't ask you to go out to get a new </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2128"> and <span class="dlf">mines</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2129">I did go and the next day after jury duty I was called to do my regular  9 Chita, to my wife's <span class="populated place">home town</span>, and finding out that my father-in-law got the papers already for me. </sentence><sentence id="2130">If not, I got to know a time now because I'm afraid that it's burning under my feet to remain without doing anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="2131">I did not trust the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and the KGB that they are not ultimately going to arrest me, okay? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2132"> End of Tape #3  0 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2133">A: I finished all of that, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2134">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2135">I was right now .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2139">Q: Well, your last words, you were in <span class="populated place">Chita</span> and you were saying something to the effect that you knew you had to leave the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2291">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: Now, we are talking about early May, not early the Ist or the 2nd, but it was in May of 19 -- it had to be about -- to finish what I'm going to say -- had to be about May the 11th or 10th. </sentence><sentence id="2294">Something like here, of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2295">So we came there and take a look in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2296">I found from my <span class="populated place">home town</span> a guy who went to <span class="building">school</span> with. </sentence><sentence id="2297">We used to rent an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> when we first moved to that <span class="populated place">city</span>, that was our first <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that we rent from his family to live in. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And he tells me the good news as I had to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="2299">Nobody was left. </sentence><sentence id="2300">He was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And I say to him I would like to go to <span class="country">Sri Lanka</span> to visit it. </sentence><sentence id="2302">He says please don't do that because one of the guys which he told me, which was also a guy of our age, who lived through in hiding, the first day he came back towards <span class="country">Sri Lanka</span>, he was shot dead and killed. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Well, they didn't -- seeing us come back meant one thing, which I gave you to read about, the article. </sentence><sentence id="2304">It meant one thing, returning the <span class="interior space">apartments</span> or returning the <span class="building">homes</span> or the <span class="building">buildings</span> to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2305">It was confiscated by their volition from the Germans and the Polish government, which it was established right after the war came to an end in that part which the Soviets liberated, they did not look into it about the Poles should return with a public <span class="dlf">property</span>, of their own <span class="dlf">property</span>, which it was unofficially taken by them. </sentence><sentence id="2306">So they didn't want to give it up, so it was easier to kill the Jews who claimed that instead of giving up theirs. </sentence><sentence id="2307">I understand as of late the tule changed a little because they tried at one time to -- a lot of them claimed the <span class="dlf">properties</span> years afterwards when they came <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2308">And the Polish government made a trick about it. </sentence><sentence id="2309">Yeah, you didn't pay the taxes in so many years. </sentence><sentence id="2310">So now, how much the tax would be to pay was more than the value of the <span class="building">house</span> would be on the <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2311">So that was another way, that way they did not have to return properties to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2312">I understand as of late right now, they changed that any public property -- like, for instance, a <span class="building">synagogue</span>, a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>, or the <span class="dlf">cemeteries</span> or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the <span class="populated place">community</span> as one, if they had claims to prove through legal means, they would return it back to the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2313">But they didn't have to return it back to any personal owner. </sentence><sentence id="2314">But that's what they tried to do. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Maybe it was another Yeshua imitation that you should back to <span class="country">Poland</span>, so I listened to him, and didn't dare to go to the -- not to my <span class="populated place">birth town</span> or to the <span class="populated place">home town</span> that I lived from where I was chased out in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="2316">And we decided -- I met somebody else who I knew in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span> already from my <span class="populated place">home town</span>, and he came asked me would I go with him for black marketing assignment. </sentence><sentence id="2317">They used to go into <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2318">They used to go into <span class="country">Germany</span>, bring certain things from there and get farm goods where they could be more available on this end and that's how it went on. </sentence><sentence id="2319">And people were doing this here black marketeering quite freely at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2320">There was no interference by any of the governments at that particular time because the public was in need of means. </sentence><sentence id="2321">And the governments were not ready and able to help them restore. </sentence><sentence id="2322">So they were happy that no on is making demands on them. </sentence><sentence id="2323">Well, my wife heard that, she says, "No, you're not going." </sentence><sentence id="2324">And I, you know, I did not want to separate myself, although the means would have helped us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2325">Another thing happened to me, my father-in-law brought me -- he gave me along to take along when I was escaping, to take a box of yeast. </sentence><sentence id="2326">Yeast, they used to make moonshine and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And yeast was coming in a <span class="spatial object">can</span> at that particular time, was easily accessible, and was the means of getting money. </sentence><sentence id="2328">When I came to the <span class="building">house</span> where I met my friend, I had over there light flints and this here and it was stolen the first day. </sentence><sentence id="2329">So I had a bad taste about being in -- so I said to  3 my wife, "We cannot go here. </sentence><sentence id="2330">We cannot go there." </sentence><sentence id="2331">We heard that <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> is building up a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, and we heard a lot of people that we knew from were going to <span class="populated place">Ledz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2332">So these days, it was very easy to decide, you get your stuff which you have, cover, or whatever it is that he was carrying around in knapsack like, and you go to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2333">We came to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, we found a lot of the former partisans which were there from same force as we were. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And we found a lot more people from various <span class="populated place">cities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2335">It was quite a big returning place, Jews from the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2336">That Jews survived in <span class="populated place">camps</span>, I did not know until in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span> when I worked for the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2337">That one day we were told that a <span class="spatial object">train</span> is passing by <span class="populated place">town</span> on the way to <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> and in it there were inmates from <span class="populated place">camps</span> that survived the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2338">Only then, which it means in "45 of May, maybe about April or so, did I for the first time I went purposely to the <span class="building">station</span> to see how these people looked. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And that's the first time I saw the uniform with the stripes and I saw the faces of people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Because to our own meaning we thought the Jews were murdered out the same as it happened in our <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2341">That there were massacres, and they killed them out. </sentence><sentence id="2342">We had no idea of knowledge that there were such things as <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So it was the first time that I saw that in about April in <span class="populated place">Baranovichi</span>, and then here coming to <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> and <span class="populated place">Ledz</span>, I found out the other parts of survivors in inmates in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2397">A: It was as much as if I was to be thrown into a different world altogether on a different <span class="region">part of the world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2398">It was the most unbelievable thing for me and many more about me who came out of the <span class="env feature">forests</span> or for hiding to see people surviving especially after I found out what the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> were all about. </sentence><sentence id="2399">You, for instance, until you read it, you didn't know about it either, but to us survivors, it was a new phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="2400">A new strange thing to find out. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And it was some in all -- although I spoke to those people, it sounded a very disbelievable type of story, but that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And we did not even know how to treat it. </sentence><sentence id="2403">You did not know. </sentence><sentence id="2404">Do you feel better about it with these people that you met? </sentence><sentence id="2405">Do you have any conversation? </sentence><sentence id="2406">Because to go on and have conversation, we had nothing in common because that was not the way things happened at all. </sentence><sentence id="2407">To go on our conversation that we did was again, strange people, what are you telling me about it? </sentence><sentence id="2408">We have suffered; we were in <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and you were killing and murdering and doing this here, like this here fighting the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2409">It was a strange story for them to believe, and it was as strange to us to believe their plight and their story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

of Vodka, you did a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="2818">And if you heard it said, it's not just said, it was a true fact. </sentence><sentence id="2819">But I was standing -- my wife at that time had a ring, other things. </sentence><sentence id="2820">So she did it in the old plan. </sentence><sentence id="2821">We had, you know, from knitting yarn, so she made a ball of yarn out of it, and whatever we wanted to hide, we put it on the inside. </sentence><sentence id="2822">And with the needle, you know what I mean, so it looks very innocent that you know in the midst of starting to knit something, and that's how we got. </sentence><sentence id="2823">We did not have that much to hide to begin with, but some guys in the group -- not in my group so much as the other -- were people who had money, you know what I mean, that they had -- how they got it, speculating my things it's none of my business what they had. </sentence><sentence id="2824">And now we came in there, we were one, two, three that the Russians, and the rest of the group were on the other side of the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2825">And there within a few hundred feet or so we were on <span class="region">British territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2826">Instructions were given to us that we must walk very quietly because we are going to enter a <span

id="2831">So here we got in our midst some guys, coming in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I knew them quite well. </sentence><sentence id="2832">And those people started yelling, and I asked them please behave. </sentence><sentence id="2833">You were told it's the <span class="region">English zone</span>, we must enter quietly, and we must not yell. </sentence><sentence id="2834">What are you doing? </sentence><sentence id="2835">Looks Sheila's hiding some stuff, maybe gold or who knows from him, and she remained behind. </sentence><sentence id="2836">And they're making yelling noise. </sentence><sentence id="2837">And I asked them to please stop, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2838">I and two more guys grabbed the man by his hand and the other guy with the other -- we carried them in inside. </sentence><sentence id="2839">There was a warm <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, we put them under the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2840">After that the group of guys saw that here's a bunch of rebels, which it was the partisans and each time each one of us would look back, we would be looked sideways, you know what I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="2841">And all of a sudden, it became quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2842">We were in that <span class="populated place">camp</span> for about two days, and one night we were told to get ready because pick-up time is going to be tonight. </sentence><sentence id="2843">The Fifth Army, which it was the British Army stationed there on the <span

looks of challah, they served us challah. </sentence><sentence id="2850">We couldn't get it over, sort of we are used to before the war challah was served on a Saturday, Friday. </sentence><sentence id="2851">But here in the middle of the day, you know what I mean, weak challah and the food they served up, it was out of this world. </sentence><sentence id="2852">We were led in to take <span

we were let to go in to join the <span class="populated place">international camps</span>, which they were the <span class="building">Armra</span> (ph), if you've heard about it. </sentence><sentence

for assignment of where, but it was warm in <span class="country">Italy</span> in that part at that time of year. </sentence><sentence id="2859">So literally in a <span class="dlf">park</span>, we were just with bundles on our back, whichever one had something to cover himself to sleep on and  0 we were on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2860">The next day that we were there in <span class="populated place">Bologna</span> in that place in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, rather, 5,000 <span class="spatial object">armed trucks</span> were brought in which they were survivors of the <span class="populated place">Mauthausen camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2861">Among all these people in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, my

</sentence><sentence id="3305">And a lot of people lose themselves to answer the question. </sentence><sentence id="3306">His idealism as a professor speaking to us, which he used, terror is an expression by a strong -- like he brought out <span class="country">Germany</span>, like he brought out the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> -- who has nothing to lose and he can get involved in terror. </sentence><sentence id="3307">Terror is also a means by someone who cannot lost anymore either because he has nowhere to go, so it's as a last resort. </sentence><sentence id="3308">So he tried to say in his speech, Professor Garfinkel at that time, that <span class="country">Israel</span> at this time is not in a way that she has a lot to lose. </sentence><sentence id="3309">So, therefore, by going to go ahead and extend terror at that particular time, we may lose what we achieved. </sentence><sentence id="3310">So, therefore, we should go ahead and train our people who go to <span class="country">Israel</span> that they should join the left, , the Labor Party, which they were anti-terrorists instead of joining the right,  6 everything like that, <span class="country">Israel</span> was granted statehood. </sentence><sentence id="3311">Well, all through this time we had a big problem as of to prepare the newcomers to <span class="country">Israel</span> that they should be aware of what's going on at least on both ends and let them make an intelligence like that. </sentence><sentence id="3312">So every time while I gained at that time leadership to become a leader for my <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>, and that <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> was not to far from <span class="populated place">Modena</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3313">I successfully sent away from there a few groups, that they were trained and the training meant in a way almost brainwashing. </sentence><sentence id="3314">Tell them what's going on while teaching him certain trades, and being the <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> was always meant to do something and in a grand way. </sentence><sentence id="3315">And since we made a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> to be near <span class="dlf">farms</span>, so it was good for us that we were away from the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3316">We could do more things that we wanted to do while the <span class="populated place">city</span>, the government would not allow us for these here things. </sentence><sentence id="3317">And this is the way a network was set up of people to be sent illegally to bypass the British, because the British white paper came out at that time which forbade for the Jews even as the DPs to come legally to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3318">So that's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out, and that's what had stopped afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="3319">But by hook or by crook, illegals were available. </sentence><sentence id="3320">These same people who faced the war and faced all its tribulation were ready to go back to <span class="country">Israel</span> under all circumstances possible, and a lot of them did give their life right there in the first battles that ensued before <span class="country">Israel</span> became a state. </sentence><sentence id="3321">Others survived and they remained Israeli citizens and provided a good <span class="building">home</span> for themselves and for their offsprings. </sentence><sentence id="3322">But the fact remains that these people that after going through all the agony of war, being in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, us, the partisans from the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, did not stop to say enough is enough. </sentence><sentence id="3323">But they still were willing to give their given years what they had with them to go to fight for a cause. </sentence><sentence id="3324">So again, we became new soldiers to go out and fight for <span class="country">Israel</span> at this time, and no longer for our personal things ourselves and that was all about. </sentence><sentence id="3325">I did successfully have a few <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> and any time I ask my superiors when is my turn to go, "No, we still need you. </sentence><sentence id="3326">We still need you." </sentence><sentence id="3327">They kept on knocking it down. " </sentence><sentence id="3328">You get legal passage to <span class="country">Israel</span> and you'll get it." </sentence><sentence id="3329">One day I come and I have the new good news to break to them. </sentence><sentence id="3330">I used to come to <span class="populated place">Rome</span> or <span class="populated place">Milano</span>, and we were near <span class="populated place">Milano</span>, <span class="populated place">Milano</span> was our point. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And I tried to tell them, "I have good news and bad news. </sentence><sentence id="3332">I said the good news is that I'm going to become a father. </sentence><sentence id="3333">The bad news is I'm on the <span class="dlf">road</span>, how can I go ahead to do this here?" </sentence><sentence id="3334">And I did one thing which I want to admit to myself at that time again, a personal thing. </sentence><sentence id="3335">When I found out that my wife is pregnant, I took time off. </sentence><sentence id="3336">We knew that in <span class="country">Italy</span>, there was some of the doctors from our <span class="env feature">forest</span> that were with us. </sentence><sentence id="3337">And there were two doctors over there, <span class="building">Rockover</span> (ph) and <span class="building">Mastniq</span> (ph) which that's how he was he called. </sentence><sentence id="3338">They both were surgeons, they saved a lot of lives during the war. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And that was in <span class="populated place">Venice</span> or <span class="populated place">Venezia</span>, the way it's called in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="3340">They were living in a <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3341">I took my wife and made a trip to <span class="populated place">Venice</span>, ready to do an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="3342">I'm glad she's not present, she doesn't like for me to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="3343">And we knew that it was done, just like in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3344">Dr.Mastnigq, as a matter of fact, died here a couple of years ago in <span class="region">Florida</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3345">He says, "Yes, we are doing it, Harold, but we won't do it to you." </sentence><sentence id="3346">I says, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="3347">Please, I cannot afford to have a child right now." </sentence><sentence id="3348">He says, "First, yet you cannot afford for your wife to have an abortion." </sentence><sentence id="3349">I says, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="3350">He says, "Look, there's a chance if we abort the first time that she may not be able to bear children. </sentence><sentence id="3351">You will not be happy not to have a family." </sentence><sentence id="3352">And I stopped begging him, I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="3353">And we both went <span class="building">home</span> brokenhearted which later on in years in <span class="populated place">New York</span> when I used to come to visit my father-in-law in the summer months with the grandchildren, and one day I go to my father-in-law, he says, "I'm going to say hello to Dr.  7 Mesnick (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="3354">I come into there and I show him my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="3355">He said to me, "Is that what you tried to destroy?" </sentence><sentence id="3356">I begged him not to talk about it because I did not want my daughter even to know. </sentence><sentence id="3357">She was too young even to be talked about a subject like this here at the time. </sentence><sentence id="3358">But it was sort of how much all the agony I could get, I even got it from this part, too, in the right way, and it was -- I was a joyful person after that. </sentence><sentence id="3359">Seeing that there is life and we got the rebuilding to do. </sentence><sentence id="3360">The only thing we had to stop at second child. </sentence><sentence id="3361">My son was born in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>; it was due to both children my wife had to have two Cesarean sections. </sentence><sentence id="3362">And the birth of daughter in <span class="populated place">Florence</span>, <span class="country">Italy</span> was a hard story to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="3363">So he gave me the same doctor, Manonovich (ph) was his name, he was also a refugee who survived from <span class="country">Greece</span>, the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And he gave me a letter when I told him we are going to <span class="country">America</span>, and he says, "Please, don't have her suffer. </sentence><sentence id="3365">When you come to <span class="country">America</span>, give that letter to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="3366">So if your wife gets pregnant again, let her not go through with her pain." </sentence><sentence id="3367">And little did I realize that the same <span class="dlf">Cesarean section</span> with my wife, by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she got up, put her lipstick on, and it was, again -- in <span class="country">Italy</span>, she was in a <span class="building">Catholic hospital</span>, the <span class="building">maternita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3368">She was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> for a whole month. </sentence><sentence id="3369">And talking the way people were nice to us, especially the Italians, they immediately understood that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3370">Most likely, I'm kosher; they did not serve any kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="3371">They couldn't bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="3372">Because I gave them the chocolates that I used to, Nestle's and Hershey that my relatives used to send me and the cigarettes, they permitted me, first of all, to have a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> in the <span class="building">hospital</span> so I could be with my wife all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3373">I could bring in food from the outside like chicken, and they permitted me to set up there that I could cook for her soup and a piece of chicken. </sentence><sentence id="3374">So she had her means. </sentence><sentence id="3375">So it's undescribable to see it, it was a <span class="building">Catholic church</span>, but Italians were very gracious to the displaced persons who came there after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3376">And I thought I want to bring that out whenever I have an opportunity to tell about it and I just did. </sentence><sentence id="3377">So when I came telling them that, they said, "Well, wait. </sentence><sentence id="3378">You can still be working." </sentence><sentence id="3379">A few months later, my wife at that time must have gone into the eight months or so. </sentence><sentence id="3380">They say to me, "Now, with your group, you're going to be taken." </sentence><sentence id="3381">I says, "I with my group?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3516">Q: Now, this what you were calling it <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> was in the <span class="region">Florence area</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="3517">It wasn't a <span class="dlf">park</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3520">A: No, that one I say I joined it, again, it was the form of a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> created on another <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> like, well, like it was in the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3522">Q: Collective living arrangement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3524">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="3525">It was a collective living type. </sentence><sentence id="3526">And we referred to them -- you know, which I have the pictures. </sentence><sentence id="3527">I will show them to you, which we called it a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3528"><span class="populated place">Kibbutz Alvet</span>, which we called it, which it was a part of the labor movement in <span class="country">Israel</span> and it was culturally when on. </sentence><sentence id="3529">But we worked it in means of a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> that way, that we would share the responsibility together. </sentence><sentence id="3530">We would all work together for all things that needed to be done. </sentence><sentence id="3531">So it needed to be done cleaning, our own people did the cleaning and cooking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3540">Q: What about religion there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3542">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3543">We had found over there <span class="interior space">room</span> enough in the <span class="building">villa</span> that we were living to make like a <span class="building">synagogue</span> inside of it. </sentence><sentence id="3544">And believe it not, one year for the High Holidays when I was the one who was doing the pray conducting, the prayers as a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="3545">And right up to the holidays when I got the visa, everybody was joking, saying, "You see, you prayed well. </sentence><sentence id="3546">It immediately worked." </sentence><sentence id="3547">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3554">Q: Did that feel good about it, to be able to be a Jew again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3556">A: It felt more than good, because like I say understanding that , which means I  9 big issue with himself that we justified ourselves and we turned our anger, not to God, but our angered returned to man. </sentence><sentence id="3557">And any time whenever I wrote something about it or I spoke, I still ask the same question. </sentence><sentence id="3558">So where was man in those days? </sentence><sentence id="3559">And I still feel justified with my question. </sentence><sentence id="3560">Not to ask where God was or where God is or what did God do, I would not want to find out that there is a God who really tried to have us punished because of something we did wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3561">Because I believe that God is referred to me as a father. </sentence><sentence id="3562">God is referred to me as a person who loves me as a father, and, therefore, this type of god cannot go ahead to ask that I should be killed, murdered, maimed, all of these here things for disobedience. </sentence><sentence id="3563">A father does not ask for that. </sentence><sentence id="3564">A father does not even want to surrender his child for something little bit he did to <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3565">So when you say the return back to believe was easy perhaps at once, but you felt something is missing in our life that we survived. </sentence><sentence id="3566">And I believe religion was one of the basic things that we sought and we found ourselves in. </sentence><sentence id="3567">I have a lot about any results saying in many instances, but I don't want to -- this is not the place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3598">A: I wanted to make a point, and I'll read already it one more time. </sentence><sentence id="3599">I said God is invisible to us. </sentence><sentence id="3600">We don't know where he is or what he is, but it's part of our belief. </sentence><sentence id="3601">That is, the , | believe. </sentence><sentence id="3602">What I believe in something really that other than created by man  0 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3603">So that's my interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="3604">I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the war against the Jews because at any time, the preparation legally he got them through <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to make everything legal what he did afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="3605">Which I mean at this time, the humanization program, the right of taking away from all of them that they're not even humans; they're subhumans. </sentence><sentence id="3606">And, therefore, he prepared it so that the people should not feel that they're doing an injustice, but the people are getting rid of a menace or something, it's not so. </sentence><sentence id="3607">So when man let one person, one person's religion, if you -- I want to call it a religion, because he believed in it, in Nazism -- go as far as it was worded to let destroy people and destroy their offspring and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3608">How can I turn to ask for -- to look for the invisible or the person that I cannot speak personally or ask him questions? </sentence><sentence id="3609">This is why my conviction past World War IL past the Holocaust, remains that believing in the invisible, believing in the Jewish theology, believing in all the creation, that this did is something worth analyzing again, and it's something worth living. </sentence><sentence id="3610">And I remain Jewish, that's a fact. </sentence><sentence id="3611">I almost tried to get away with it as I told in my chapter. </sentence><sentence id="3612">And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made not to work against the tide, but to go with the tide. </sentence><sentence id="3613">And I feel very comfortably today that I do not ask the Almighty what he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3631">Q: During the war years, was religion at all important to you? </sentence><sentence id="3632">Was it a source of strength? </sentence><sentence id="3633">Did you resent it? </sentence><sentence id="3634">Did you think about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: Perhaps it's hard for you to memorize what we did earlier, but I did tell you in the most horrendous days of my life being in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, that I was exposed and be with a brother to my father and he was a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3640">And I have told you the way he was speaking to me, that we must go on and doing it because in the 14th century with the , God had so much  1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3641">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3642">Firstly, let's remember what I said to you in the other words. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3651">Q: Pretend this is the first time you've told me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3653">A: Okay, all right. </sentence><sentence id="3654">Being the fact that I was in a <span class="building">Soviet underground</span>, for me to think religiously could have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system. </sentence><sentence id="3655">So even in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, we had the politicians come back to us when the paratroopers showed up and the whole idea of brainwashing restarted again. </sentence><sentence id="3656">So for me to think at that time religiously would have been the biggest crime I could have done after to myself, speaking in the first undertone. </sentence><sentence id="3657">Now, in my <span class="interior space">inner sanctum</span>, did I think of religion? </sentence><sentence id="3658">I used to look at the <span class="env feature">stars</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="3659">Being around and doing something and seeing the <span class="env feature">moon</span> shining, and I would sometimes say, "God, can't you do something for me?" </sentence><sentence id="3660">So to answer whether I totally dissipated or got away from that, no. </sentence><sentence id="3661">That little spark was in me. </sentence><sentence id="3662">And I remember when I went out of that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> going to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, a prayer went up to me. </sentence><sentence id="3663">No more like when Jacob ran away from his brother, Esau. </sentence><sentence id="3664">And he sort of tried to make a contract with God. </sentence><sentence id="3665">Say, "If you save me, I will be your servant for all the duration of my life." </sentence><sentence id="3666">That night, with <span class="env feature">moon</span> and the <span class="env feature">stars</span> my witnesses, that's what my prayer was. </sentence><sentence id="3667">And maybe he listened. </sentence><sentence id="3668">But I did survive, but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on, and I will go on like that. </sentence><sentence id="3669">I feel comfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my <span class="building">house</span> and through my family I have been a member of a <span class="building">synagogue</span> all through the years being in <span class="country">America</span>, even at times it was hard financially to do so. </sentence><sentence id="3670">So on that question I must say I feel good about it, without asking the questions. </sentence><sentence id="3671">To me, it feels the same thing as if a young person gets killed. </sentence><sentence id="3672">It's a pain, but you don't keep on brooding on it for all your life. </sentence><sentence id="3673">When you're reminded, you feel the pain again. </sentence><sentence id="3674">But you try to go with your life without brooding on it all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3675">That's the best answer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3676">I'm happy that there are still Jews in this world who want to go on and live as Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3707">A: In my life as a youngster on through coming to the <span class="country">United States</span>, I stumbled every time on a tyrant. </sentence><sentence id="3708">Be the tyrannical part of Hitler, be the tyrannical part that I've seen before Hitler invaded <span class="country">Poland</span> that I've seen from the Nationalist Party, be it the time when I used to go to <span class="building">school</span> and rocks was thrown at me by children who lived in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3709">Not because I did anything to them, but it was always that one answer, you are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3710">And it sort of became a theology, being a Jew means you got to pay in any kind of way. </sentence><sentence id="3711">So even rocks thrown at you means part of you because it's not thrown at you because you are Harold; it's  2 thrown because the Jewish -- you are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3712">So I cannot help it but go on in the way I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="3713">It looks like it's over. </sentence><sentence id="3714">You're ready? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3723">Q: You were talking about how you were always castigated for being a Jew, torn between tyrants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3725">A: This is one part I tried to bring out. </sentence><sentence id="3726">I, for instance, always had to challenge a tyrant. </sentence><sentence id="3727">To me, the tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather from my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="3728">And it was a debate at that time whether I shouldn't be let go to <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, so in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> I could meet up with the <span class="building">American Counsel</span>, I can perhaps go to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3729">At that particular time, my father would not permit me to go on my own, so he says, "See if your grandfather, after all, he's got all his children there, if your grandfather will take you to go with him, then you can go. </sentence><sentence id="3730">Otherwise, I will not permit it." </sentence><sentence id="3731">And that was the decision making that we had to take out a passport because the law came out whoever wants to stay here in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> must obtain a passport. </sentence><sentence id="3732">That's the rule of the <span class="env feature">land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3733">Those people who do not wish to take out passport can return back to <span class="country">Germany</span> which it was sort of a critical kind of way. </sentence><sentence id="3734">And there was some who did not wish to remain under Communist regime, and they went and signed up to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span> -- to the occupied <span class="country">Poland</span> under <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3735">And the fortunate thing that had happened at a later time was an unfortunate thing it happened then. </sentence><sentence id="3736">The KGB rounded them up by night on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and loaded them into <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and to <span class="region">Siberia</span> they went. </sentence><sentence id="3737">Those people survived the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="3738">Some of them were drafted to the army, they were of age. </sentence><sentence id="3739">Otherwise, they could join later on into the Polish Army that Stalin created into. </sentence><sentence id="3740">And so a bad thing of yesterday became a good thing for tomorrow, but at the time there was a tyrannical thought and a tyrannical thing that I grew up with. </sentence><sentence id="3741">And when I and my grandfather together went in to have a passport, the captain and the police started yelling it "How come" -- he didn't ask a question why you didn't come any earlier and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3742">But in a blistering voice he sort of dared to speak so loud to my grandfather, which my grandfather still had the beard. </sentence><sentence id="3743">He always had the beard long enough to remind me of Casimir, The Great, one of the Polish kings that were in existence. </sentence><sentence id="3744">And I always used to refer to him, in jokingly speaking, which he wouldn't tolerate that, of course. </sentence><sentence id="3745">So again, even a little item like that over why we were late and I come and making the <span class="spatial object">passport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3746">I couldn't tell him I wanted to escape to go to <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> maybe wind up in <span class="country">America</span>, that would be the wrong thing. </sentence><sentence id="3747">So I saw sort of tyranny in the workings. </sentence><sentence id="3748">Afterwards when I decided to be a good boy through <span class="building">school</span> and I volunteered to go to do certain jobs, and I started believing that working make a person better and everything like that, I volunteered to go to work on the <span class="interior space">factory level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3749">It was near <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> where they were building housings for the military at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="3750">I was a frail, in a way of speech, young guy who never did do hard labor work. </sentence><sentence id="3751">The hardest thing in labor I did was sawing, chopping wood or sawing that thing for the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3752">Being a Zionist, it used to be a summer type of chore that you wanted to go help them. </sentence><sentence id="3753">The money that we were paid we used to put it sort of cooperatively, be able to go to a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> where we was practicing Zionist scouting and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3754">But I wasn't used to carry a <span class="spatial object">wheelbarrow</span> like, you know, that you had to be the husky kind of guy. </sentence><sentence id="3755">And I lasted two weeks, and while being there again, I found tyrannical ways. </sentence><sentence id="3756">All of a sudden when all the preaching to me was equality and Socialism, there I found out for the first time  3 of my young life that they had rates of pay. </sentence><sentence id="3757">One guy for the same work was rated one kind of a pay. </sentence><sentence id="3758">One kind -- the other guy was rated maybe less or more. </sentence><sentence id="3759">Now, that was not Socialism, that was not Communism; that was Capitalism. </sentence><sentence id="3760">I was smart enough to understand it from my <span class="building">school</span> years when those subjects were taught in <span class="building">school</span> about what Capitalism is and what Socialism is. </sentence><sentence id="3761">So again, in my own young mind then and even up till today, it was sort of a tyrannical kind of a way, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3762">And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and going through the selections, right and left, and being beaten up, and being taken to <span class="populated place">Slonim</span> to <span class="building">jail</span>, and then winding up in a <span class="populated place">work labor camp</span> until the partisans freed us. </sentence><sentence id="3763">All I saw was tyranny, and then I finally am the free man and I'm in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3764">I'm already -- every time I turn around, I still see anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="3765">I still see all kinds, that people are sort of valueless instead of being valuable. </sentence><sentence id="3766">You know how hard we thing about today when we hear an accident one person dead, a child died, or be from an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> or anything like that, it makes font page headlines and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="3767">Look how life meant through that era of years, be on the <span class="region">Soviet side</span>, be on the <span class="region">Nazi side</span>, life was meaningless. </sentence><sentence id="3768">For a guy to kill somebody even in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, he did not have to wait for a court martial as it was later years organized when the paratroopers, and all of a sudden life became -- be a little bit more with a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="3769">They couldn't go ahead, just pick the pistol and kill somebody. </sentence><sentence id="3770">They had to stand trial. </sentence><sentence id="3771">Even the police and Germans that we captured as POWs, they were not just taken out and shot. </sentence><sentence id="3772">There was a trial. </sentence><sentence id="3773">It was conducted in front of -- at least to make it look like a trial. </sentence><sentence id="3774">So again, tyranny is in work, so no matter how I put myself together in the picture when I started to write about it, I though the best title for it would be "Torn Between Tyrants." </sentence><sentence id="3775">I remember one time, it entered my mind -- and as a matter of fact, I even wrote a poem naming it like this here -- "Memories That Linger On." </sentence><sentence id="3776">But I did not find that to be strong enough to describe my living at a time and all I went through to be just memories that linger on. </sentence><sentence id="3777">Everybody has memories lingered on. </sentence><sentence id="3778">But "Torn Between Tyrants" stood up to me because really that's what I was telling in my story, and I am telling it today the same way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3833">Q: Do you think that that's still the way of life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3835">A: It justifies me of the past; however, I divorced myself of the tyrannical seeing and feeling unless I talk about the Ku Klux Klan, and I find that even in a free society as we live in the <span class="country">United States</span>, that in order for us to be free, we must tolerate even the people who are not worthy to be tolerated, but that is really our freedom. </sentence><sentence id="3836">Therefore, therefore, I am not faced with a tyrannical way unless I think, just think of the story with <span class="populated place">Skokie</span> when the Nazis wanted to come and march. </sentence><sentence id="3837">In part, listening and seeing that people have still this kind of gut feeling in them to do to prove that Hitler was right is tyranny to me. </sentence><sentence id="3838">Because again as I say, where is man to understand man? </sentence><sentence id="3839">If I'm right, I'm right; and if I'm wrong, at least point me out where I'm wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3840">You cannot always live by the lying propaganda about it. </sentence><sentence id="3841">So "Torn Between Tyrants" is not any longer a part of my life, but it was definitely a part of me and part of my life between the late "30s until liberation came and then after until maybe until I felt differently when I came to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3849">Q: Let's talk about the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3850">For Jewish people who went to fight with the partisans, was there a different commitment and a different situation than for the Soviet partisans? </sentence><sentence id="3851">Different  4 responsibilities, different . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3855">A: Let me bring in a little story over here. </sentence><sentence id="3856">We know for a fact that on many occasions that it happened. </sentence><sentence id="3857">That Hitler tried to use the partisans in focus among Jews, so what they did on a few occasions send Jews to go. </sentence><sentence id="3858">And they wired them, like I said -- not wire them as we understand it of today. </sentence><sentence id="3859">With certain criteria, they supplied them where to go and they'll take you in. </sentence><sentence id="3860">And your job will be to remember some of the things and come back, as their location, what are they involved, how much ammunition do they have, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3861">And I cannot attest to this moment that it was anti-Semitism because I was not there listening to the trial or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="3862">But the fact stands out that there were on a few occasions the Jews met their death, they didn't believe that they did in order to save their lives and were willing to give the cooperation of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3863">And they probably did it with the hope that they will be understood, so their argument was then why didn't they come clean originally to say, "Look, I've been sent here by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3864">I am to do this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="3865">However, that was my best way of escaping or coming." </sentence><sentence id="3866">So argumentive, who knows? </sentence><sentence id="3867">Maybe the person listening to their testimony at the time was not seeing the world this, he only saw to lull Jew is no crime. </sentence><sentence id="3868">So yes, it did happen in many kind of ways. </sentence><sentence id="3869">And Jews, even when I escaped and I came to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, it was not as easily as a guy from the <span class="region">local areas</span> who did not want to go to <span class="country">Germany</span> for labor or who did not want to be inducted in the German Army which they made all of those openings for them. </sentence><sentence id="3870">Although they had them in separate corps, you know what I mean, serving. </sentence><sentence id="3871">When they came and they escaped and they told their reason, it was on his <span class="region">home turf</span>, remember. </sentence><sentence id="3872">He probably was not from many miles away, he was from the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3873">And it was very easy, it wasn't a question will they accept him; it was a question only where is he going to be placed? </sentence><sentence id="3874">Is he going to be placed in our <span class="building">battalion</span> or in another <span class="building">battalion</span>, whatever it is? </sentence><sentence id="3875">But he had an easy <span class="building">home</span>, much easier than fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="3876">Now, the only time I could say that it wasn't a problem was after the massacre in <span class="country">Germany</span>, in <span class="populated place">Chita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3877">After the massacre, for instance -- or before that massacre in <span class="populated place">Bentschen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3878">When the Jews came, it was another story. </sentence><sentence id="3879">There was, however, a fact that from <span class="populated place">Chita</span>, one -- the most intelligent at the time would have been in our midst, who rose to be an attorney. </sentence><sentence id="3880">And he was party, which again to say that's what Hitler tried to do, to annihilate the first thing, then come against you. </sentence><sentence id="3881">If he once he has the brains out, everything will be easy for him to achieve his goal of the final solution. </sentence><sentence id="3882">So he, a man came and organized a group, and he came to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3883">He's been shot, he did not live in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> more than days before being killed. </sentence><sentence id="3884">And again, what would you say? </sentence><sentence id="3885">Was that an act of anti-Semitism? </sentence><sentence id="3886">Was it an act of jealousy because he was intelligent? </sentence><sentence id="3887">Take it for what it's worth it. </sentence><sentence id="3888">I am not familiar for the time serving in that <span class="region">area</span> as a partisan, that a Gentile person was treated the same way as that Voretsky (ph) was, you know, from <span class="populated place">Chita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3889">That we know a fact, and tell you one more thing. </sentence><sentence id="3890">We had a guy by the name of Bo Levine (ph); that was his name. </sentence><sentence id="3891">The man had the highest medal, he was responsible for downing more <span class="spatial object">trains</span> in our midst at that time than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3892">Sure, everybody knew Bo Levine, a blonde guy. </sentence><sentence id="3893">There was not much to see that he was, you know, six-foot tall, a husky kind of guy. </sentence><sentence id="3894">He was of an average height, you know, five- nine, five-ten, stuff like this here. </sentence><sentence id="3895">But that man had only one thing in his mind, what the tyrannical ways taught him to do. </sentence><sentence id="3896">Is to go and seek vengeance. </sentence><sentence id="3897">There were cases where we, all of us were involved in vengeance-seeking, because there were anti-partisans or anti-  5 Soviets, but then in some cases, some went to take vengeance to those that we knew who came into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and robbed from Jews or anything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="3898">Yes, we went to seek vengeance, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3943">Q: So you're saying that for a Jew to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and be a partisan was a difficult risk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3945">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3946">Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3947">He was another story, and I am talking now when you use that word, "partisans," I'm talking about if he came and fall into the partisans, that there were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3948">If he came into the <span class="building">National Polish Partisans</span> or in the <span class="region">Ukraine part</span> we called them <span class="building">Bondarises</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3949">These here people were just doing the same job that the Nazis did outside, and they were poisoned by the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="3950">They were anti-Soviet and they were anti- German just the same, and Jew what they to. </sentence><sentence id="3951">So be that it was the era of the time that  6 horror or stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="3952">I was changed, too. </sentence><sentence id="3953">And I want to be making this testimony right now. </sentence><sentence id="3954">Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3965">Q: So to some extent, you become your enemy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3967">A: Your enemy or survival. </sentence><sentence id="3968">Or survival. </sentence><sentence id="3969">I cannot use my own enemy, I can use the word that you do various things to survive, and I would justify that because you have to. </sentence><sentence id="3970">End of Tape #5  7 Tape #6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3975">Q: When you were fighting . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3977">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3979">Q: ... what do you think was your greatest difficulty? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3981">A: Basically, at first when I was fighting the greatest difficulty was to get involved in killing because I still to this day do not want to use that method as what we were doing as killing. </sentence><sentence id="3982">It was defending. </sentence><sentence id="3983">It was self-defense. </sentence><sentence id="3984">Even the Bible tells us that if someone that if someone rises to kill you, you rightfully have the right to stand up and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3985">So I must make that clear that our way was not that we were coming from a culture to say that that's the only way to do. </sentence><sentence id="3986">Our way was everything must be done in order to not let the enemy win. </sentence><sentence id="3987">Oddly the enemy was instilled in us and in me precisely about it, and I wrote it one time talking and interviewing somebody from the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3988">And I asked the same question, did the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> electrified being everywhere in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, how come so few threw themselves? </sentence><sentence id="3989">I said I know and I heard of cases where people threw themselves on the <span class="dlf">wires</span> in order to get it over with from all the sufferings. </sentence><sentence id="3990">But that wouldn't that be common sense to say in a case like that where you gave up life and you know you have no escape. </sentence><sentence id="3991">So why let the person get the best out of you? </sentence><sentence id="3992">Go ahead and get it over with. </sentence><sentence id="3993">But the fact remains that life is very dear. </sentence><sentence id="3994">That is the reason we stop sometimes to eulogize one little child who didn't show anything in life, and we eulogize one little murder that it happened and we take it at the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="3995">And this always must remain a separation between murder and self-defense. </sentence><sentence id="3996">We cannot take it as for granted that a person uses a gun to kill to name him a killer. </sentence><sentence id="3997">He sometimes uses a gun to kill to stay alive, to defend himself of the other one who is trying to kill him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4015">Q: Do you have any thoughts on why more people didn't fight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4017">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4018">When I first came to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and for a while I was very bitter that I did not have a lot more followers like myself. </sentence><sentence id="4019">And the fact remains of the group that I had organized in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Briesen</span>, not a single one after all the talk with it, not one who was on my group or in my group at that time, which it fell through, survived. </sentence><sentence id="4020">Not one. </sentence><sentence id="4021">The best fact again is with my uncle, that he came out of hiding, crying and hugging and telling me why didn't you listen to your Harold? </sentence><sentence id="4022">And this is a known fact of life that people at times do not want to listen to righteous person, but then they come eulogizing why didn't we listen? </sentence><sentence id="4023">And that was the same bitterness that I had in me for quite a while that I didn't, even though seeing the hardship and the facts that the bottom line was that I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="4024">Even if it took me three weeks to get there, the bottom line was that the four of us, when we came we only found one Jew who I used to feel hurt about calling him a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4025">The man was assimilated, he had birth already, his parents were no longer Jewish and he was not understanding a single word, although the guy who came with me couldn't speak Yiddish either. </sentence><sentence id="4026">He learned Yiddish later during the period of time because  8 he was also sort of an assimilated Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4027">And I often used to, with the other ones, say, "I'll tell you, when I am here, at least I have a reason. </sentence><sentence id="4028">I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4029">I don't want to offend you." </sentence><sentence id="4030">Because I used to talk to him, I says, "Tell me, what did you know about Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="4031">He says, "Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4032">To me, a Jew did not stop for one moment to think." </sentence><sentence id="4033">I did not have a guilty feeling that I am not practicing Judaism, you know, so I says, "This is where my hurt feels when I see your hurt, I feel I'm hurting for something. </sentence><sentence id="4034">And here I see you're hurting for nothing, so I'm probably putting your case above mine, so please never be mad for my questions I'm asking you." </sentence><sentence id="4035">And I still proceed to say more should have sacrificed their lives by escaping instead of just justifying the means that there was no way out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4055">Q: I see as still a <span class="spatial object">fighter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4056">Can you talk just for a little bit about the long-term impact that your experiences have had on you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4118">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4119">Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4120">I think it belongs with each other. </sentence><sentence id="4121">Maybe in some other nationalities which I could not have the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="4122">I wasn't somebody else, I was me. </sentence><sentence id="4123">Maybe it's a different situation. </sentence><sentence id="4124">Maybe they in some nationalities look at fighting that it's a part of patriotism and the guy who didn't fight is not a patriot. </sentence><sentence id="4125">I believe it's wrong because not everybody can be a fighter, no longer that everybody can be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="4126">Not everybody can be a scientist. </sentence><sentence id="4127">Not everybody can be anything else. </sentence><sentence id="4128">I say for a person to resort to be able to go to fight, I believe it's something in the person himself. </sentence><sentence id="4129">I cannot see that he's just going and lagging because these guys, they are the first one to raise that white flag once they are in the armies. </sentence><sentence id="4130">And I could not be thinking that way, but in the Jewish way -- let me speak to what I am and what I know. </sentence><sentence id="4131">I believe we must retrain our offsprings. </sentence><sentence id="4132">It cannot be said that a Jewish boy cannot go to learn how to shoot a gun or to go to a course where guns are being taught how to shoot and where, or the same story of being hunting. </sentence><sentence id="4133">We always used to have a criteria and a joke that when a Jew became a Gentile after he does everything else he could do with the Gentile in <span class="building">church</span> and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="4134">But the story goes after he had to join him when he went hunting, he says that I cannot do. </sentence><sentence id="4135">Why do I have to go kill that animal? </sentence><sentence id="4136">And as we know, that's a popular thing, and we know for the record if we were start looking around, that few Jews are hunters. </sentence><sentence id="4137">But you say Gentile, it's sort of an inborn thing with them that hunting season, they got to go, they got to see that blood and kill that little animal, you know what I mean, or so on or the other. </sentence><sentence id="4138">Regardless what it is, but that's a whole admission to go duck hunting or to go deer hunting and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4139">I believe we must learn from history. </sentence><sentence id="4140">We are an old, old <span class="country">nation</span> of survival, but perhaps it's time for us to look into it from a different perspective. </sentence><sentence id="4141">That to survive as we see the religious person with the beard in <span class="country">Israel</span> and with the tefillin on his head, he stays and prays the gun on his arm. </sentence><sentence id="4142">We must tolerate it, not look down on it because that, I believe, is the only way of survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4168">Q: To stay vigilant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4170">A: To stay vigilant and not be different this case than the other <span class="country">nations</span> around. </sentence><sentence id="4171">You cannot go by the story of what at that time Esau and Jacob were blessed by their father where he told to Esau, "You shall live on your sword." </sentence><sentence id="4172">While he told Jacob to be -- it's good, meaningful things and I believe it doesn't hurt to do both. </sentence><sentence id="4173">You can still become a rabbi, you can still become a student of theology. </sentence><sentence id="4174">You can become a student what you want. </sentence><sentence id="4175">But don't look down that it comes a time that you have to resort to be drafted in the service and you have to go to defend your <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4176">I believe that's the way it should be. </sentence><sentence id="4177">We know past doing the Czar, during the other one, that the Jews were no good for anything but they drafted them in the service anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4178">They were good for meat for the <span class="spatial object">cannon</span>, for cannon meat, you know, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4179">And there were, therefore, a lot Jews who did not want to go serve because they couldn't have the kosher foods, you know what I mean, served to them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4180">And they would <span class="dlf">desert</span> a lot of times because it was  0 against their belief religiously. </sentence><sentence id="4181">And in other words, why should I go fight for somebody that when I get through fighting -- the analogy would go again with the black people of the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4182">That when they had to go fighting, they couldn't be together with the white man who was fighting the same enemy. </sentence><sentence id="4183">So there are certain changes must come true in life as it goes on, and the changes is with understanding. </sentence><sentence id="4184">So to answer you, I am still a fighter, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4200">Q: Is there anything else you want to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4202">A: Well, this part, I believe, you can talk and bring out more Biblical stories or more of the other one stories. </sentence><sentence id="4203">I used to say that if we were to hail after the kingdom of the day of David, King Solomon, we would have been another people. </sentence><sentence id="4204">However, we must understand that all of that happened when we were a <span class="country">country</span> on own <span class="region">land</span>, and in order to be a <span class="country">country</span>, we had to have a military. </sentence><sentence id="4205">We had to have an army. </sentence><sentence id="4206">But when we were driven out or taken off our <span class="region">land</span>, so we saw the holiday of poor what it tells us. </sentence><sentence id="4207">The story with Mordecai, the story with Esther. </sentence><sentence id="4208">Speaking about it, a lot of people see something missing in the while story, that it goes on, and at times they are very despondent. </sentence><sentence id="4209">Because look what Mordecai did, he told is niece to go ahead and get married to a non-Jew, which it remains questionable to a student who starts learning. </sentence><sentence id="4210">That student has to be so much accommodating to justify that. </sentence><sentence id="4211">For the sake of survival, you do everything. </sentence><sentence id="4212">I, for instance, justify what Mordecai did. </sentence><sentence id="4213">If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself to become that queen, that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in on that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome was that she remains the hero. </sentence><sentence id="4214">We don't call it the scroll of Mordecai; we call it the scroll of Esther. </sentence><sentence id="4215">So the whole story of Esther became. </sentence><sentence id="4216">So we can take it and see the difference. </sentence><sentence id="4217">If that would have happened in <span class="country">Israel</span> perhaps like the high priest when it comes when it come with the story of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="4218">He showed, he and his sons were the first ones to rise and kill these people who wanted to switch him over to the Greek mythology at that particular time and become of a different belief and the pig and everything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="4219">But he was a leader, and he rose, so maybe if something like that would have happened by one of the conquerors in <span class="country">Israel</span>, we would have had another story to tell again of heroism when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="4220">But since it happened outside the <span class="region">realm</span> and the country of <span class="country">Israel</span>, there was only one way to do, is politically. </sentence><sentence id="4221">And that's what Mordecai did, he did a political thing in order to save the Jews at that time of <span class="country">Persia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4222">But it's confusing when you start reading at times and remain Jewish like the question is asked. </sentence><sentence id="4223">You can go on on so many various historical facts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4246">Q: Okay, but I don't -- yeah, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4248">A: But it's only going to come to the same conclusion, so if you want to dwell, you'll find it. </sentence><sentence id="4249">More and more to what I just am saying or said. </sentence><sentence id="4250">And I want to conclude in it in saying in order to survive as a nation for the years and years and centuries to come, we see the change and the change was started from <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4251">We see the capabilities, no one in the world with modern weaponry had ever created a thing like <span class="populated place">Entebbe</span> where the whole  1 world was rocked, of how they did stand up and do it. </sentence><sentence id="4252">So that's what I am saying, you must stand up, but you must also <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4253">I'm all for the way it is in <span class="country">Israel</span>, but I'm only against that one thing. </sentence><sentence id="4254">That they still give a person who is religious, they give him, in other words, a way that he can because of that avoid being drafted in the army. </sentence><sentence id="4255">I believe that cannot be done. </sentence><sentence id="4256">If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing, let him work in a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4257">Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission, save lives. </sentence><sentence id="4258">Don't have to go up, that's still a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="4259">A soldier who saved the other injured one is still a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="4260">He can still continue with his rabbinical or theological ways of prayer and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="4261">But that must be done, we cannot exclude somebody because he is of religious belief that he should not serve in an army. </sentence><sentence id="4262">I don't believe in this theory at all, and I hope someday this will be changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
