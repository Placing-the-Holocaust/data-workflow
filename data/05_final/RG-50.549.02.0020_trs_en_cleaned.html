they had to delouse us. </sentence><sentence id="52">They had to give us medical attention and they feed us and try and sort of organize. </sentence><sentence id="53">I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced group, a very sick group at that point. </sentence><sentence id="54">And once they took our names and asked us if we had a <span class="building">home</span> to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original <span class="building">homes</span> and some of us stayed behind and stayed in the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="55">I was in a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> for quite awhile and then I chose to go back <span class="building">home</span> to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back <span class="building">home</span> and that we could reunite. </sentence><sentence id="56">But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back. </sentence><sentence id="57">One aunt, who survived <span class="populated place">Auschwitz concentration camp</span>, went to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> rather than coming to our <span class="populated place">hometown</span> in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, thinking that I hadn't survived, although sh -- she did see me in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz camp</span>, so she knew I was there. </sentence><sentence id="58">But she thought that I, too had gone to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, as millions of others had. </sentence><sentence id="59">And when she heard that I had survived, she too came back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">So actually it was just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="61">We came back <span class="building">home</span> and found our <span class="building">home</span> -- my mother's <span class="building">home</span> that we lived in, destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="62">Our <span class="building">home</span> was used for a <span class="dlf">lookout post</span>. </sentence><sentence

<span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">Actually, I was the very first one to come <span class="building">home</span> in our <span class="populated place">community</span> and I was the first one to move into my grandmother's <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">And I would go and meet a <span class="spatial object">train</span> that passed

id="74">When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs. </sentence><sentence id="75">Our neighbors had stripped our <span class="building">homes</span>, our

id="79">Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="80">And this is what we lived on for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I knew my father was in the <span class="country">United States</span>, but I did not know where. </sentence><sentence id="82">And I could have never found him, except that he found me. </sentence><sentence id="83">My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the <span class="building">Post Office</span> in our <span class="populated place">town</span>,

able to get in touch with him. </sentence><sentence id="85">And he was able to send me American dollars through the letters that came. </sentence><sentence id="86">A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were selling on the <span class="building">Black Market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for it, because the money in <span class="country">Europe</span> was really devalued at that particular time, so we were able to buy food after awhile. </sentence><sentence id="88">We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it's the <span class="building">United Restitutio</span> -- I don -- I don't know, it was called <span class="building">Unrah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">I don't know what it stands for, actually.
