</sentence><sentence id="1515">We was waiting for the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1516">You're going to see that picture. </sentence><sentence id="1517">We are going to show later on, and there was a little SS, red hair with a big black camera like a like an accordion I should say (laughter). </sentence><sentence id="1518">And why I remember so good because we was joking from that guy. </sentence><sentence id="1519">How come they pick him up for the SS because usually when they pick up a man for the SS they got to be tall...you got to be perfect, see. </sentence><sentence id="1520">But somehow (laughter) they pick him up. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He was a little guy, red hair. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Anyway, he make that picture and I remember that day and that picture was made as I can remember as I come to <span class="populated place">Flossenburg</span> on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us there. </sentence><sentence id="1523">It must be around August 18, 19 or maybe 20th that picture was made. </sentence><sentence id="1524">How this picture survived, how they get it, how they put it there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1525">But I'm there see, and then on a in a <span class="dlf">quarry</span> they put me in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't remember...was four of us, six of us, few gangs like that...our job was going in a <span class="dlf">quarry</span> way deep with a dynamite that granite night before, and those big

say this picture was made in a first day in a <span class="building">quarry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Because on that picture I got the shoes with the wooden sole and after a while I was assigned for those Kette Kommando...put the chains on...what was so much climbing, they give me leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I remember that that was the first day in a in a <span

time, you have extra bonus. </sentence><sentence id="1567">We say in a week, one mark, two mark bonus, so you can buy something in the <span class="building">canteen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1568">They had a <span class="building">canteen</span> in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine told me, look
