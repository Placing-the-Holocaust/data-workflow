<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good afternoon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: I'd like to start by having you tell us your name when you were born and the <span class="populated place">town</span> you were born in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is George Havas, I was born in 1929 and <span class="populated place">town</span>'s name was <span class="populated place">Mukachevo</span> (aka <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> in Hungarian). </sentence><sentence id="10">At that time it was part of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me something about the <span class="populated place">town</span> and how many things you remember, earliest things you remember as a small child about your <span class="populated place">town</span> and your <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, what it looked like, what the environment was like there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: <span class="populated place">Town</span> was, I should mention it's part of <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span>, the population was about between 28 and 30,000 and kind of old fashioned by today's standards and about half of the population was Jewish, other parts were Hungarian and Ruthenian and at that time when I was born, there were also Czechs living there, the Czechs were the administrative people and the officers in the army. </sentence><sentence id="16">There were many <span class="building">schools</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, at various levels, there were maybe four or five <span class="building">elementary schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">Some of them were let's say, Hungarian or Czech or I think there was only one all <span class="building">Czech school</span>, I went to that <span class="building">school</span> and there were also many <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> and also a <span class="building">Hebrew elementary school</span> and <span class="building">Hebrew High School</span> and a <span class="building">secondary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">The <span class="dlf">streets</span> were lined, many of the <span class="dlf">streets</span> in the center of the <span class="populated place">town</span> were lined with <span class="building">shops</span>, all kinds of <span class="building">stores</span>, they were selling everything possible, like textiles, fabrics, clothing, shoes, shirts and porcelain, anything you wanted you could buy there. </sentence><sentence id="19">There were also various <span class="building">factories</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span>, like there was a <span class="building">tobacco factory</span>, there were, outside of <span class="populated place">town</span> was a <span class="building">match factory</span> and there was <span class="building">alcohol factory</span> and people worked in the various places and there were also various classes of people, I mean lower class, middle class and the professionals, there were many, many doctors, many attorneys and poorer people and all kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="populated place">town</span> was surrounded by many <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">The tural people brought in produce and vegetables, chickens and things of that sort and that was <span class="building">market</span> days and they used to come in with their <span class="spatial object">carts</span> and sell things at a <span class="building">market</span> or sometimes you could buy things from them on the <span class="dlf">street</span> as they were going towards the <span class="building">market</span> and everything was fresh and from producer to consumer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="30">Q: And your family, tell me about your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: My father was a doctor and he had a general practice. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: <span class="building">Leo Havas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">And most of his patients were from the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, sometimes somebody was seriously sick, they put him in the <span class="spatial object">cart</span> with either horses or oxen and just dragged him into <span class="populated place">town</span> and brought him to the doctor and it was like a different century from the way things are today. </sentence><sentence id="36">There were, in the <span class="populated place">town</span> there many have been four people who had <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">The rest of the people just walked, the 01:06 most common way of going anywhere was by walking, if you had to go to some distance, you hired a <span class="spatial object">cab</span>, a <span class="spatial object">horse drawn cab</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">And there was a place in the center of the <span class="populated place">town</span> where these were lined up and while they were waiting they were eating hay, the horses and the drivers were just lounging around or sitting around. </sentence><sentence id="39">If you wanted to go to the next <span class="populated place">town</span>, which was 42 kilometers away, where my father's parents lived and we used to go ona Sunday to a section on <span class="dlf">Main Street</span> where there were <span class="spatial object">taxicabs</span>, these were <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span> and sometimes we used to get together with some other people and hire one and go to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> and just to wait for us and certain time we came back with them. </sentence><sentence id="40">So just 42 kilometers which is like, I don't know, maybe 35 miles, was an adventure, going somewhere that distance. </sentence><sentence id="41">Or let's say if you wanted to go to the <span class="building">train station</span>, which was at the edge of the <span class="populated place">town</span> at a certain place, sometimes people used to hire a <span class="spatial object">horse drawn cab</span> to go there [with the] to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">Plus you had <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, so it was simpler to get a <span class="spatial object">cab</span> and go over there that way. </sentence><sentence id="43">I don't know if you want me to tell you about the Czechs, they were interesting, I mean it was, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> was at that time, perhaps the only democratic or the most democratic <span class="country">country</span> in <span class="region">Central Europe</span>, but again it was, the Czechs were running the <span class="country">country</span> and they were, there were Czechs and there were other nationalities but the officers and the government were mainly in the hands of the Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="44">Once, supposedly when <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span> joined the <span class="country">republic</span>, which was in 1919, they were promised autonomy but the Czechs never gave it to them because the Czechs never considered anybody else capable of running his own affairs except themselves. </sentence><sentence id="45">And same within <span class="country">Slovakia</span> too, the Slovaks were living in their own <span class="region">area</span>, but 01:08 many of the positions were held by Czechs and of course Slovaks resented it and to some extent I suppose the Ruthenians also resented it and the <span class="env feature">Carpathians</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: But as a child growing up in the thirties, how did this division manifest itself, how were you made aware of it? </sentence><sentence id="61">Or were you aware of it at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: It was I could say a schizoid existence, I mean since the Czechs were the ruling caste, you might say, my father wanted me to become Czech, which, he didn't realize it and I  only found out let's say decades after the war that you cannot become Czech, I mean you can be a citizen of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> but you have to be born in the <span class="dlf">Czech lines</span> and you have to be Czech several generations back to be a Czech. </sentence><sentence id="65">And at <span class="building">home</span> we spoke Hungarian, in <span class="building">school</span> I spoke Czech and I had Czech friends and with whom I spoke Czech, since I spoke both languages fluently, like kids do usually, without accents and it was kind of, I was trying to be a Czech with the Czechs and at the same time speaking Hungarian at <span class="building">home</span>, which sort of was, as I said before, kind 01:10 of a schizoid existence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: Did the Czechs behave differently, did your Czech friends have different attitudes about things than your Hungarian friends? </sentence><sentence id="70">Did they do different things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: The Hungarian friends were not Hungarians, they were Jewish, see it goes way back to the place was originally part of <span class="country">Austria-Hungary</span> and part of, within <span class="country">Austria Hungary</span>, it was part of <span class="country">Hungary</span> and anybody who wanted to exist at that time, or get ahead had to learn Hungarian and that's where the Jews became sort of broken up. </sentence><sentence id="74">The ones in the <span class="populated place">villages</span> continued speaking Yiddish, the ones who wanted to get ahead learned Hungarian and just by that fact alone, they became separated from those who didn't and if let's say my father wanted to go to, first he had to go to a secondary <span class="building">school</span> before he went to <span class="building">University</span> and those <span class="building">schools</span> were at that time Hungarian language, there was only Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="75">And then came the war and the place became, <span class="country">Hungary</span> was divided up and the part where we were became <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> eventually, so there were these different nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="76">Some Jews consider themselves Hungarian because they spoke Hungarian and they just thought they were Hungarian and some just considered themselves Jewish and would say if there was a census, they said they are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="77">Some Jews consider 01:12 themselves Czechs, but as I told you they would have considered themselves Czechs but they were really not accepted by the Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="78">And on the same thing, my father was more or less encouraging me to be friendly with Czech boys and I felt comfortable with them but there was this conflict that you speak in different language at <span class="building">home</span> and you speak a different language with us, so what are you really? </sentence><sentence id="79">And then he wanted me to joina Czech gymnastic society which was called <span class="populated place">Sokol</span>, which was very nationalistic. </sentence><sentence id="80">It has a long tradition in <span class="region">Bohemia and Moravia</span>, the <span class="region">Czech lands</span>, and they admitted me for the exercises, but they kept forever postponing, giving me membership certificate or a membership booklet or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="81">And all kinds of excuses, but they wouldn't give it to me. </sentence><sentence id="82">And the other thing was lots of the Czechs did not like Jews, but the big difference was that the Czechs did not persecute us. </sentence><sentence id="83">That's one thing not to like Jews and that's the next step is to hate Jews, then the next step is to kill Jews and so there was a big  difference, but already by the age of maybe five or six, I knew that some people hated me just for being Jewish and that's the kind of world 01:14 it was. </sentence><sentence id="84">Let's say I knew about <span class="country">Germany</span>, I knew about Nazis before I was even six and possibly I knew more than kids in the <span class="populated place">villages</span> because I was exposed to more things and we had a radio and we had newsreels, newsreels in the movies, and more contact with things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Were these things a topic of discussion in your family constantly, too, because . . </sentence><sentence id="100">.Did your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Not constantly, but it was. </sentence><sentence id="104">Things were talked about and let's say maybe I had bigger ears than some other kids and I overheard many things and I listen in on things and the word Nazi was in the <span class="spatial object">dictionary</span>, I mean in our <span class="spatial object">spoken dictionary</span> and I knew that word, I did not know it's full meaning, but I knew that word you might say as early as six. </sentence><sentence id="105">When I went to <span class="building">elementary school</span>, <span class="building">Czech elementary school</span>, one of the courses which they were teaching us was Civil Air Defense and they showed us films of gas bombings, fire bombings and things of that sort and how to defend against those kinds of things, so let's say maybe at an age of eight or nine, I was already exposed to those kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="106">Children at that same age in <span class="country">America</span>, they never heard of things like that. </sentence><sentence id="107">| remember film where they were showing us the effect of a certain poison gas and the person was vomiting like a white foam was coming out of his mouth, I mean I knew about the effects, I mean like simulating things and things of that sort so I couldn't understand how they made that person vomit or how they could make that white come out of his mouth but they were showing films of that sort and so it was war time even before there was a war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: You had a sense of being vulnerable because you were Jewish or just that there was something out there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Getting back to the Sokols, the Sokols were not fond of Jews, but they let me exercise there, whereas once I was participating in something at <span class="building">school</span> and part of it was putting up a dance, a group of us kids had to dress up in a certain way and we were doing some Czech national dance or Slovak national dance and I wanted to change clothes to get into that special outfit and some Czech boys were there in <span class="building">scout tents</span> and my father was with me so one of them, with great reluctance, let me change in his <span class="building">tent</span> and told us we don't want Jews in our scouts, and Czech scouts did not admit Jews, so I was aware of differences and I was aware that certain things were not accessible to me because of my religion. </sentence><sentence id="116">And in the same time I had to learn to read Hebrew for the services in <span class="building">Temple</span> and how will you be ready for Bar Mitzvah if you don't learn it and this and that and my  grandmother was religious and all four of my grandparents were religious so I was brought up in that tradition, I had great difficulty in reading Hebrew, to read Hebrew and it was just, I mean as a kid, the letters are different, the words don't mean anything and it was not taught as a living language at that time and it just for me was very difficult but somehow the kids in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, they learned it and they could read it like fast and recite the prayers fast and 01:19 I never managed to acquire that, so they were way ahead of us on that front. </sentence><sentence id="117">And then, I'd say our first contact, I mean first thing which affected us, which we noticed was when the Germans occupied <span class="country">Austria</span>, there were some refugees came to live in our <span class="populated place">town</span> and if you look on the map of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, it changed suddenly, suddenly the whole <span class="region">Bohemia</span>, <span class="region">Moravia</span> was surrounded by <span class="country">Germany</span> and it was just foreboding and we sort of knew, we had the idea that we would be next, but nobody wanted to believe and everybody was hoping that it wouldn't happen somehow. </sentence><sentence id="118">Plus <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> had treaties, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">France</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="country">England</span>, so we thought we were safe, that the French would protect us and the British would protect the French and the Czechs also had some kind of treaties with the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> but there were catches in that like the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> would come to the help of <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> if <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> was attacked. </sentence><sentence id="119">I think, the catch was only if <span class="country">France</span> first came to our assistance. </sentence><sentence id="120">The second problem was that <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> had no direct <span class="dlf">border</span> with the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="121">The direct, closest <span class="country">country</span> was <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Poland</span> would not permit the passage of <span class="spatial object">Russian units</span> across it's <span class="region">territory</span> to 01:21 help <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, under no circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="122">So it was a weird situation. </sentence><sentence id="123">And backtracking a little bit, for some weird reason about two weeks ago or so, I had a nightmare which brought back that experience. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was just put away out of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="125">In "37 or "36, we were in <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> on the <span class="env feature">Adriatic</span> in the summer for a short vacation and we met there some German people. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was a German couple and they had two sons and I was there with my mother and with my cousin, my father stayed <span class="building">home</span>, he had to work and earn money. </sentence><sentence id="127">And somehow these people did not know that we were Jewish and they were using our, sharing our <span class="building">cabana</span> at the <span class="env feature">beach</span> and on one occasion the man took me to the <span class="env feature">water</span> and washed off my feet and then he was going to bring me to the <span class="building">cabana</span> so my feet wouldn't get sand on them and I don't know how, which supposedly was not my habit, but I let my pants down or something and he noticed that I was Jewish and that ended our relationship or our contact and the next day or maybe that same day, the two boys beat me up for no reason, they just slapped me and slugged me and my face was burning red from the beating and I'd say that was my first beating I got for being Jewish and I was at that time maybe seven or eight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Do you remember what your mother said, or what she did? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: She wasn't with me, she was up in the <span class="interior space">room</span> and they sort of caught me while I was near that pension or something on the <span class="dlf">pathway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">There was nothing she could do, I think she 01:24 complained to the man and the man just shrugged it, oh that's just kid stuff or just nothing and , don't worry about it, but after that we had no contact with them or they had no </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Do you remember when he left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: No, I don't remember when he left, but I remember that he was gone and I remember when he came back <span class="building">home</span> and I remember that our <span class="populated place">town</span> had a <span class="building">garrison</span> to start with, a large <span class="building">garrison</span>, it was traditionally a <span class="populated place">garrison town</span> and there were many military <span class="building">barracks</span> there and going way back, probably to the day of the Austra-Hungarian times and the Czechs continued that tradition and there were many military units in our <span class="populated place">town</span> all the time and our <span class="building">home</span> happened to be on a main <span class="dlf">street</span> of the <span class="populated place">town</span> and we could always see the soldiers either marching or rolling on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, or the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> moving and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and the whole <span class="building">building</span> was shaking when those <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> were going by on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> so and they were very proud of them, they were, we kids were proud of the Czech army and we had confidence in the Czech army, in the Czechoslovak army and our weapons, I mean we knew we were well equipped and the whole <span class="country">country</span> was that way, we had what I suppose the Americans would call spunk, we had self confidence and we had determination and that's when, during the mobilization, the <span class="building">garrison</span> was increased. </sentence><sentence id="149">There were many, many soldiers and what, the day a mobilization is carried out, let's say, people from <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span> were assigned to <span class="building">units</span> in <span class="region">Moravia</span>, people from <span class="country">Bohemia</span> were assigned to units in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> and so forth, everything is mixed so it would, people from <span class="region">local areas</span> would be in different <span class="region">areas</span> and our <span class="populated place">town</span> was full of let's say soldiers from let's say <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, Bohemia and <span class="region">Moravia</span> and training and going by on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> were modern, some of them had 10 wheels on them, <span class="spatial object">terrain vehicles</span>, for all kinds of <span class="env feature">terrain</span> and the <span class="spatial object">trunks</span>, the <span class="spatial object">cabs</span> had <span class="dlf">holes</span> in them for emptying out the <span class="spatial object">machine guns</span>, so it 01:31 was, equipment was contemporary, modern and the troops couldn't move and some, many of the troops were also Cavalry and the artillery were <span class="spatial object">horse-drawn buggy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">But much of it was mechanized, much of it was motorized, so it was a modern army. </sentence><sentence id="151">And that's when this <span class="populated place">Munich</span> came, it was a horrible let down for the whole <span class="country">country</span>, for us and in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: What happened in the <span class="building">schools</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: It was the sadness, a horrible sadness and people, some of them, people were from, the teachers were from Bohemia and <span class="region">Moravia</span> and some of their <span class="populated place">towns</span> were being taken over, after <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, by the Germans and one blow followed another. </sentence><sentence id="160">This was, the <span class="populated place">Munich</span> took place at September 30th. </sentence><sentence id="161">And then the Hungarians kept, started pressuring for the return of <span class="region">territory</span>, what they call return, which were Hungarian population . </sentence><sentence id="162">And our <span class="populated place">town</span> happened to have a sizable Hungarian population and there was,  <span class="dlf">border line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="163">And on the evening of November 2nd, a <span class="spatial object">radio</span> was in the <span class="interior space">living room</span>, so we were having supper in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> so we could be near the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> and hear the news and they started reading off the <span class="populated place">towns</span>, going from west to east, which <span class="populated place">towns</span> will be turned over to the Hungarians and he's reading <span class="populated place">Kosice</span>, which is already <span class="region">eastern Slovakia</span> and then <span class="populated place">Uzhgorod</span>, which is in <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span>, 43 kilometers to the west of us and <span class="populated place">Mukatchevo</span> and then Baranog(ph) and when he said <span class="populated place">Mukatchevo</span>), which is our <span class="populated place">town</span>, my father virtually choked on his food, because he, let's say, put, in old expression, all his money on the Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="164">He was trying to bring us up as Czechs, we were trying to be Czech and he knew the Hungarians from experience he had before, after World War 1, during World War 1, and it was a total shock for him and he changed and our whole life changed as a result of that, let's say, the Hungarians called it they are liberating us. </sentence><sentence id="165">To us it was they are occupying us and that took place on November 10th, eight days after what was called the <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> arbitrage. </sentence><sentence id="166">The last <span class="spatial object">Czech units</span> pulled out around two in the afternoon, it was a beautiful, sunny day, mild and the last to leave were the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and it was just, to me, to us, it was a heartbreaking scene. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: My father was shaking like, I supposed that they might taken him because he was friendly towards the Czechs and now the Czechs are gone and they're going to get even with anybody who was friendly towards the Czechs and who was not a loyal Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="196">If you're a local person, you should be loyal to the Hungarians, you had no business kowtowing to the Czechs and they didn't take him, but we heard rumors and all kinds of things that the people were badly beaten, that they were tortured and there was one name whom I remember, who vanished. </sentence><sentence id="197">And he was later, some drunk Hungarian gendarme said, oh he had a tough skull, but we cracked it never the less. </sentence><sentence id="198">And nobody spoke about it and nobody knew about it and in some places later on, we heard that, behind what they called the <span class="building">gendarmerie(ph) barracks</span>, there were people buried. </sentence><sentence id="199">There were no arrest warrants, there were no records or anything and so they could do most anything. </sentence><sentence id="200">That was a word which may be strange to you, <span class="building">gendarmerie</span>, well in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, there were police, in the <span class="region">rural areas</span> they called them gendarmerie and they had different uniforms and different customs and that's what they were called and again, it was tradition in Europe, all the way maybe, entire 01:40: central and <span class="region">eastern Europe</span> and even <span class="region">western Europe</span> and even in <span class="country">France</span> there were <span class="building">rural police</span> and there were <span class="building">in-town police</span> and they were different. </sentence><sentence id="201">And it was just a completely new world, it was terror and fear and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Did your father continue to have his <span class="building">medical practice</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: There was a man in our <span class="populated place">town</span> who was the leading Hungarian during the Czech regime, while it was <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and he sort of kept, did the equivalent of what the Sudeten Germans did in the <span class="region">Sudeten area</span>, in other words, the resistance to the Czechs and agitating towards the Czechs, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and when the Hungarians came in he became, let's say king. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: What was his name, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Oh, yeah, his name was Vazari, Vazari, Aladar and he and my father were enemies, so naturally as soon as the thing changed, it was extremely bad for my father. </sentence><sentence id="217">All the doctors had to report to king Vazari and explain their misdeeds during the Czech occupation and sort of show, I'm guessing, let's say what you might call show cause why you should be permitted to continue practice as a doctor, why you should be admitted to  0 be a Hungarian or something of that sort, why you should still have your license or something like that, and I don't know how many doctors from our <span class="populated place">town</span> got called in, maybe 20 out of 50 or, I don't know, but my father was among them. </sentence><sentence id="218">Let's say 19 of the 20 were certified, the only one who wasn't was my father, out of the whole <span class="populated place">town</span> and there was, as far as I can remember, there 01:43 was no appeal or there, maybe he tried some appeal and tried to drag out something, but the final word came down, you are not permitted to practice, take off the signs from outside your <span class="building">house</span> and my father continued practicing illegally, clandestinely or secretly, I don't know which way you want to phrase it or put it. </sentence><sentence id="219">And it was stress, it was stress on him and stress was passed on to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Before you go on, do you have any idea what kinds of activities your father was engaged in that could have caused this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Just being, trying to pass as a Czech, having sent his children to <span class="building">Czech schools</span>, when there was a good <span class="building">Hungarian school</span> available, I mean quote, unquote, good. </sentence><sentence id="228">The <span class="building">Czech school</span> was the best <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">Why did you send your children to <span class="building">Czech schools</span> and again, in the <span class="building">Czech schools</span>, we had, at the end of the year we had what in <span class="country">America</span> is called a report card, but over there it was a sheet of paper, on which was the name of the student and I believe that among other things which was written at the top was name, date of birth, was also the nationality and I think that I was entered there as Czech and the Czechs did not protest, you say you're a Czech, fine, put him down a Czech, but when the Hungarians came in and I had to transfer to <span class="building">Hungarian school</span>, I had to show the certificate from the previous year, at which year I was, at which level I was, so I would be placed in the <span class="building">Hungarian school</span> and the person who was in charge there was again, a very loyal Hungarian, loyal from the Hungarian point of view, who saw to it that the certificate is turned into the hands of Vazari(ph) and it's, clearly it says here that this child was declared as <span class="country">Czech</span> and not only that, my younger brother, he had a middle name, a Czech middle name, in addition. </sentence><sentence id="230">His name was Robert, but to make it Czech-er, my father added Milan, which was not common over there, nobody had middle names, it was very uncommon. </sentence><sentence id="231">And so it wasn't enough for him to be listed as a Czech, he even gave him a Czech name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Was he, to your knowledge, involved in any kinds of political activities or outspoken in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: He was not? </sentence><sentence id="244"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No, he was, to my great surprise, he told me once, years later, during the occupation, I got to talking to him about the Czech parties, political parties. </sentence><sentence id="248">In 1934 there were elections in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and the strongest party was the Agrarian, the number one and I remember the name social democrats and the name of maybe one other party and there was even a Zionist party and they managed to get one man into the <span class="building">Czech parliament</span>, so I said, did you vote for the Agrarian? </sentence><sentence id="249">He says, no, they were crooks. </sentence><sentence id="250">I said, did you vote for the social democrats, he said no. </sentence><sentence id="251">So I was at the end of my list, I said, well what did you vote for? </sentence><sentence id="252">The Communists, they were the only honest ones. </sentence><sentence id="253">And later on I found out that he cooperated with the Communists, when the Communists were beaten up by the Czech police in some kind of a demonstration or something, they used to take him clandestinely through back <span class="dlf">streets</span>, to the <span class="region">hiding places</span>, where he was treating them, giving them first aid or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="254">But far as I know, that was secret, nobody knew about that. </sentence><sentence id="255">You asked me about early memories and going back, backtracking, probably one of the earliest ones, again looking out from our <span class="dlf">windows</span>, where the first of many demonstrations, thousands and thousands of people were marching every first of May. </sentence><sentence id="256">And just marching with banners and on both sides, Czech police with nightsticks, escort, but it was just amazing how many people were, I don't know how to phrase it, let's say loyal to that cause, how many people identified with that cause and every year people in clean clothes and spruced up and people on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> and all the <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> had red paper ribbons in the wheels and the spokes and red banners and bands and marching bands. </sentence><sentence id="257">The bands from the <span class="building">tobacco factory</span> workers and all those and it was just interesting, I don't know how else to put it and it was, it was accepted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: It was tolerated by ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: No, it was not tolerated, it was part of the life of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">The Communist Party was outlawed in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">Soon as the Hungarians took over, they got hold of those people who were leaning Communist and they went after those and they beat them, they arrested them and then the first chance they had they tried them and they imprisoned them, when they already got to that stage. </sentence><sentence id="274"><span class="country">Hungary</span> had, see I'm jumping back and forth, it's impossible to keep everything in chronological order and sequences. </sentence><sentence id="275"><span class="country">Hungary</span> had an interesting way, it had a regular army and it also had an 01:50: army like an SS army. </sentence><sentence id="276">It wasn't SS, it was like an army of volunteers which went on attacks against <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> when it was still, originally <span class="region">Czech territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">They used to infiltrate across the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">They tried to kill Czech soldiers, they tried to blow up things and they tried to, various sabotage acts and things of that sort, but where as they had, the Germans did identical things in the <span class="region">Sudeten area</span>, they blew up <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, they killed people who were, let's say German socialists or Czechs or stuff like that and they attacked <span class="dlf">Czech border posts</span>, they attacked <span class="building">Czech customs posts</span>, <span class="building">Czech gendarmerie stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">Well the Hungarians tried to do the same thing except they were not successful  2 and the Czechs intercepted them, captured them and imprisoned them and held them and tortured them and who knows what they did to them, but once the <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> Arbitrage came and the Hungarians took over, they had to turn them loose, they had to release all these prisoners, but they continued their activities even during a time of war, there were organizations which let's say -- one day our <span class="populated place">town</span> was, I don't know what to call it, raided or something. </sentence><sentence id="280">You look out from the <span class="dlf">windows</span> as always, it was a custom then, always looking out from the <span class="dlf">windows</span> to see what's going on and the <span class="dlf">street</span> is blocked off. </sentence><sentence id="281">Hungarian soldiers with rifles and bayonets and some kind of people are going from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span> and searching. </sentence><sentence id="282">And they come to our <span class="building">house</span> and they search like bandits, I mean like robbers or like police here, I mean police are same in every <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="283">Pulling out all <span class="spatial object">drawers</span>, turning over the <span class="spatial object">drawers</span> and there were some, always used to go into all the <span class="interior space">closets</span> in my <span class="building">home</span> and always looking for things and pictures and this and that. </sentence><sentence id="284">My father or my mother had a stack of postcards, picture postcards and I always used to go through those, but there was some <span class="interior space">drawers</span> which they wouldn't let me in and now everything was tossed open, everything was lying there. </sentence><sentence id="285">And it was like bandits coming into your <span class="building">house</span> and tossing things about in front of your own eyes, with absolute authority and we had, you didn't know what was coming out of it and my younger brother had a small <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and he outgrew that too, so the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> was just put into an empty <span class="interior space">room</span>, thinking of empty <span class="interior space">rooms</span> again, sidetracking, the <span class="interior space">room</span> became empty because we sold the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>, hoping to come to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">So we sold the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> from two <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, one with a big <span class="interior space">dining room</span> and fancy one which we only used on state occasions, when the American family came to visit us, we had dinner there and the other one was the <span class="interior space">living room</span> and so the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> was in there and for some reason, my father kept that math book from the <span class="building">Czech school</span> and he stuck it into that <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and when they came searching, they tossed everything apart and they came on the book. </sentence><sentence id="287">Says, what is this? </sentence><sentence id="288">And he says, it's a math book. </sentence><sentence id="289">Says, but it's not Hungarian, what is it and I says it's Czech. </sentence><sentence id="290">Are you hoping that the Czechs will be coming back here? </sentence><sentence id="291">So, I mean it was a hostile world, it was a, it just, very, very bad place and 01:55: I don't know, they couldn't find anything else so they found we had too many bars of soap, toilet soap. </sentence><sentence id="292">Says, what is this? </sentence><sentence id="293">Toilet soap. </sentence><sentence id="294">And this? </sentence><sentence id="295">Says, what do you need so much toilet soap for? </sentence><sentence id="296">Says, pack up these two <span class="spatial object">boxes</span> and turn them in to us. </sentence><sentence id="297">And they went through other <span class="building">homes</span> the same way, taking away this, taking away that and the next day, people from the <span class="populated place">town</span>, who had bigger mouths than my father or who had better positions or more, let's say, just one comparison, saying Doctor is still practicing, or  3 authority or who pulled it or what. </sentence><sentence id="298">So it was a, as I said, it was a government in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and there was a quasi-government or something, which could do all kinds of things and get away with it and be tolerated and be funded. </sentence><sentence id="299">I mean, they were drawing their pay and all that stuff from certain secret funds, let's say the <span class="building">Ministry of Defense</span> and the <span class="building">Ministry of Interior</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: This searching of your <span class="building">home</span>, did that happen fairly soon after the Hungarians came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="334">No? </sentence><sentence id="335">Not right away? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: No, that happened, I can't place it exactly, it might have been, it might have been "40 or "41. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Immediately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="345">Oh, another thing, the Hungarians came in, as soon as they came in it was already, a law was debated in <span class="building">Parliament</span> which was called the anti-Jewish law, I mean they didn't call it anti-Jewish, they called it the Jewish law, but it was an anti-Jewish law, which would deprive Jews from being, it was similar to the Nuremberg laws in <span class="country">Germany</span>, Jews could not be in this aspect of public life, Jews could not be that, Jews could not be here, they could not be journalists, they could not be university professors, if they wanted to go to a <span class="building">university</span> there would be a quota, like six percent, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="346">Jews could not have licenses to have <span class="building">stores</span>, it's just, all kinds of restrictions and depriving people of a livelihood, expropriating <span class="building">stores</span>, <span class="building">shops</span>, property, means of trade and all kinds of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="347">And it was a different world. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: At the end of the last tape, you were beginning to describe how the Hungarians laws, as they pertained to Jewish people, affected your family and would you please go into that in more detail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Well, let's say for one thing the Hungarians had a similar thing to the Hitler Jugend_, which was called Leventer(Ph) and everybody was all, any kid over 12 year old had to be in it, it was like a pre-military training, but did not involve any weapons or anything at that point yet, it was mainly sort of to be in a group, be in an organization, be under command, be drilled, perform together, march together and things of that sort and again, let's say I should say that I went to <span class="building">Hungarian Gymnasium</span>, which is <span class="building">secondary school</span>, and I became, in 1939 I was 10 and it was, for me it was a big step in life, going from <span class="building">elementary school</span> to this,big, <span class="building">middle school</span>, which was an eight year <span class="building">school</span> and I went there for the first two years and my father had the notion that I should do very well in <span class="building">school</span> so I could get into a <span class="building">university</span> and in that respect he was quite unrealistic and quite, just wouldn't accept the world as it was because no matter what kind of grades I would have gotten in that <span class="building">school</span>, the chances of my getting into a <span class="building">university</span> with my father being not on the top, on the accepted list or preferred list was virtually nil. </sentence><sentence id="363">Second, we should have, 02:04: in "38 when the <span class="env feature">clouds</span> were coming in over <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, we were thinking of coming to <span class="country">America</span> where my mother had four brothers and they were willing to send us, they did send us what they were called, affidavits, which could, might get us visas to come here, immigration visas, but my father was reluctant to leave his <span class="building">home</span> which meant so much to him and leave his practice, I'm still talking about 1938, he didn't see into the future, none of us did and he did not know that it would become <span class="country">Hungary</span> and he thought it would stay <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> forever. </sentence><sentence id="364">And his main argument was that he didn't want to work in a <span class="building">hospital</span> as an orderly until he could get his board certification or whatever was needed in <span class="country">America</span> to become a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="365">And so he was hard on me to excel in <span class="building">school</span> and study hard and I mentioned that we had a class of about 35 or 40 students in that <span class="building">class</span> which I entered and out of those there were five or six of us Jews. </sentence><sentence id="366">And four out of the five were leading students, I mean we were hustling and we were working hard and getting the grades. </sentence><sentence id="367">This was, I entered in "39 and in 1940 I entered the second class and before I finished the second class rumors started circulating that Jews will not be permitted to continue in this <span class="building">Hungarian state gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">There was a <span class="building">Hebrew gymnasium</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span> and from now on, any Jewish boy who wanted to go to <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, will go to <span class="building">Hebrew gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">And came 1941 and my father came in to register and they said yes, well, but you knew that we were not admitting any more Jews to our <span class="building">school</span>, so my father pretended he didn't know that, that's all? </sentence><sentence id="370">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="371">So during that time when I had this warning, I started learning Hebrew, the modern Hebrew, which was the official language of the <span class="building">Hebrew gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">So he had another new language for me and I already had  5 Latin, was studying Latin and this and that and again Hebrew was again very hard for me, I don't know why, it just was hard and I had to learn it from beginning, we had to get hold of books which covered the elementary Hebrew and to get up to this level which was the <span class="building">gymnasium</span> Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="373">And not only was Hebrew being taught as a language, physics was taught in Hebrew, Algebra was taught in Hebrew, so it was a new ballgame as they say and it was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="374">And we had to join this Levnter_ and if you went to <span class="building">school</span>, you participated in it at your <span class="building">school</span>, so I was now in the third year of <span class="building">gymnasium</span> and I was part of Leventer_ and the instructor came to the <span class="building">school</span> and all over 12 were put into a separate <span class="interior space">classroom</span> and were lecturing to us about, let's say about nothing and we were going down into the <span class="interior space">schoolyard</span> and doing calisthenics there and stuff like that, but they didn't last long. </sentence><sentence id="375">After a while they decided that there will be no more Jews in the Hungarian army, they will all be in <span class="building">labor units</span> and instead of having Hungarian military uniforms, they will be wearing their own civilian clothes and they will be wearing a 10 centimeter wide, yellow armband, to make sure that everybody knows that they are Jewish and maybe in the beginning they still had military caps, but that was the only thing on them, the cap and the yellow armband. </sentence><sentence id="376">Same way, no more Jews in the <span class="building">Leventer</span>, from now on yellow armband on anybody from 12 years up and you will be in <span class="interior space">pre-labor units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">So in all case it meant on a certain day of the week, the whole unit from the <span class="building">Hebrew gymnasium</span> would march off to the agricultural, I don't know what you would want to call it, <span class="building">professional school</span> or <span class="building">technical school</span> and work there with manure and things like that, help the kids who went to <span class="building">school</span> there and with the dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="378">And my father managed to get me out of that. </sentence><sentence id="379">He managed to switch my urine with a patients urine and, or give me the patients urine and I poured it into the <span class="spatial object">test tube</span> and submitted it as my own and they saw that I had kidney disease and so I managed to stay out of that <span class="building">paramilitary work unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="380">But that was how it affected me personally, so I got out of that and my classmates did not appreciate that, my Jewish classmates, it's a funny thing it was, let's say my, not my first experience, but one of my many experiences with Jews against Jews, the total, the animosity between, among Jews, the hostility for different things, one reason or another. </sentence><sentence id="381">I think the first hostility I ran into was when I went to, during that first <span class="building">school</span> I went during the Hungarian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="382">Why the <span class="building">Hungarian school</span>, not too far, couple of <span class="dlf">blocks</span> from where I lived, it was a very old <span class="building">building</span> and most of the students were poor Jewish kids and they hated me from the word go because I was middle class and they were lower class and as I found out later on in the <span class="populated place">camps</span> there was no bigger hatred than a poor Jew had towards a Jew who was not poor. </sentence><sentence id="383">So these kids used to tell me things like, "geh in d'r'erd arine", which I couldn't quite understand and I did not have that good a communication with either my father or my mother, but I had excellent lines of communication with my grandmother and my grandmother knew Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="384">So did my father, so did my mother. </sentence><sentence id="385">I took it to my grandmother, grandmother, what does this mean? </sentence><sentence id="386">She said, drop dead or you should be buried or something, well, literally. </sentence><sentence id="387">So she says, tell them this, next time they tell you that, tell them this, so I went back and I told  6 them that and they were surprised, where did you get that? </sentence><sentence id="388">So after that I was a little bit more accepted, since I could talk back to them, it lent a certain kind of a recognition or something, I don't know what you want to call it, I was on their level now. </sentence><sentence id="389">So I am, getting back now to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, it was again a completely different ball game, for one thing, during the Hungarians, the word Jew was a derogatory word, I mean, I learned, that was a new thing to me, any one of my classmates, there was only one classmate who used to come by and he was the number one or the number two student in the <span class="building">class</span>, real strong too. </sentence><sentence id="390">He never laid a hand on me, he never hit me or anything, but any time he went by me he said Zido(Ph), Jew and he could have said, what the Hungarians would say, like in <span class="country">America</span> then in the <span class="region">south</span> they never say Yankees, they always say damn Yankees, so in Hungarian it was never zido, it was always bido Zido, stinking Jew, stinking Jew and always when I heard that, it's, for a time, eleven, twelve year old, it's I don't know, you hear it all the time and still it irks and it's not something you get used to and it still, you don't build up a thick skin to it and it just, so that's how it affected me personally and when I went to the <span class="building">Hebrew high school</span> there was no more of it, nobody could call me Zido because everybody was Zido 02:15 there, everybody was Jewish, but again there was this, there were fellows from different socio-economic levels and there was friction, there was much friction, there was much hostility and there was no, no solidarity, no cohesion, no, there was never among Jews, it's really sad, it's really, they're always, two poor Jews have a stronger bond than just Jew and Jew. </sentence><sentence id="391">I mean it was always mattered to them, let's say you are from a <span class="populated place">village</span> and this fellow is from a <span class="populated place">village</span> so we have something in common and already we have more in common with, we have common with each other was we have nothing in common with that kid from <span class="populated place">Mukachevo</span>, was called <span class="populated place">Munkacz_</span> during the Hungarian (occupation), so I lived in a weird world. </sentence><sentence id="392">I can't say at this point it was schizoid, it was schizoid before, it was just weird. </sentence><sentence id="393">And my father got drafted into the <span class="building">labor unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">First of all he was in the Austro-Hungarian army, he was a lieutenant in the <span class="building">medical service</span>, as a kid fresh out of, after one year of <span class="building">med school</span> that had rank of an officer. </sentence><sentence id="395">When the Czechs mobilized they made him a private because he was a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army. </sentence><sentence id="396">So I thought now we are in Hungarian and he used to be a lieutenant, so he'll be a lieutenant again. </sentence><sentence id="397">No, (he was) not recognized, so eventually no Jew was any more recognized anyway, so he was drafted in the <span class="building">labor unit</span> and somehow he managed to get into a <span class="building">labor unit</span> which had a commander with whom he managed to get along all right, so he didn't have to work there. </sentence><sentence id="398">And the other ones who were there had to work and there was not a good <span class="spatial object">unit</span>, but somehow he managed to get along there and eventually he got discharged and then got back <span class="building">home</span>, but during that time we were <span class="building">home</span> without him and again jumping things, my father, after awhile, found it, no more practicing secretly, he was, he tried to get a front man to work with, another doctor with whom he could, to whom he could take the patients across the <span class="dlf">street</span> and sort of share and split the fee or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="399">And through that doctor we met other people and we had, it improved our social life. </sentence><sentence id="400">So that's just an aside, as far as that goes, was a minor improvement in my existence,  7 because I was among more people now and again my father was a living terror with us and it was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: How was your father a living terror? </sentence><sentence id="444">You started, you referred to that earlier, you said it was hard on you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: He was extremely hard, he was, for things which he considered, I don't know, too many things were punishable in his mind and other things for which I expected to be punished I was not punished. </sentence><sentence id="448">So if there was disorder in my <span class="interior space">room</span>, which seems to be my nature, I got a horrible beating. </sentence><sentence id="449">If I was raising hell with my younger brother, we were arguing or fighting and screaming and yelling, that was enough reason for him to fly out of his <span class="building">office</span>, which was inside the <span class="building">house</span> with a belt, a heavy belt in his hand and just hit wherever, first, last, without looking, just as long as he hit body. </sentence><sentence id="450">And schoolwork. </sentence><sentence id="451">I was lazy, I could study, but I didn't like to study. </sentence><sentence id="452">Sometimes he used to say, are you prepared, are you prepared for the lesson, you have the lesson, you studied? </sentence><sentence id="453">Are you ready to recite it? </sentence><sentence id="454">Because in <span class="building">school</span> it was always recitation, written exams were given like maybe just four times a year or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="455">All right, come into the <span class="building">office</span> and give me the, recite this assignment and turned out I didn't know nothing, I didn't, I just wasn't prepared, I was hoping to bluff my way through it or something and so I got horrible beatings, but I got beatings already as a kid, on one occasion we carried on, we raised hell or something and it ended up both of us were in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> after we got such a beating and so as I said, when he was under more pressure himself, passed it on, we got more beatings. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="472">And my mother, if she interfered, he just shoved her out of the way across the <span class="interior space">room</span>, she went flying. </sentence><sentence id="473">And on that one occasion when it was a Latin lesson and I didn't learn it and I didn't know it and it had to be known, it had to be known, learned and exactly and he took me and he started beating me and study it and beat it and beating and studying and beating and, and so finally my mother got either the maid or somebody to run to my grandmother who lived a kilometer away, get her up in the night, this was already dragging into the night and get my grandmother to come and rescue me from him. </sentence><sentence id="474">He wouldn't lay a hand on my grandmother, he had more respect for her than for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="475">And, but I told her not to interfere and I learned a lesson and to him it justified it. </sentence><sentence id="476">I mean, I can recite it today, 56 years later or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="477">To him things like that meant much, that they were very important and once I was, I hit a small pebble somewhere on the <span class="dlf">street</span> when I was still in <span class="building">Czech elementary school</span> and I was just going along in the  8 <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> and kicking it and kicking it and every time it rolled off, I kicked it back and I was going with it all the way <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>, which was a good long, maybe a mile or I don't know how far away. </sentence><sentence id="478">And it rolled off a place and I kicked it back, it went through a <span class="dlf">store window</span>, so I was horrified that I was going to get a horrible beating and I ran from the place, but they spotted me and I was a lone kid in <span class="populated place">town</span>, I mean they knew me, I was Dr. Havas's son, so they 02:24 went after him, the kid broke our <span class="dlf">store window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">And he came looking for the kid and the kid was hidden behind a <span class="dlf">door</span> and he went by and I figured if not now, I'll get it later, but that was a normal thing for a child, by him, so I didn't get a beating for that. </sentence><sentence id="480">There were inconsistencies like that, so it was a confusing, confusing world for this kid. </sentence><sentence id="481">And all right now, we go back to the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, the <span class="building">Hebrew gymnasium</span> and by then the load was bad and eventually the Germans came in, which was March, 1944 and from then on, everything was already just going, not going downhill, it was just avalanching downhill, fast. </sentence><sentence id="482">And first thing, we had a shortwave radio which, somehow inconsistently, Jews were permitted to have radios and some Jews, to show that they are totally innocent had the shortwave band sealed on their <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, so nobody could ever accuse them of listening in to forbidden foreign broadcasts and so they could not be accused of that and they could not be punished for that, whereas we had shortwave and we were listening to it, regularly, every day, to <span class="populated place">London</span> and on good days to <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">It meant a lot on some days, when there were good news, but on too many days, there were no good news. </sentence><sentence id="484">All you have to do is look at the history of World War 2 and see how it went for the Germans, how it went for the Japanese and took a long, long time before it started turning and the <span class="region">front</span> was very, very far from us to do us any good when it started to turn in our favor. </sentence><sentence id="485">And in March, 1944, Russians were the closest and they were hundreds of miles away, far, too far. </sentence><sentence id="486">So the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> got taken away and it was just, you can't imagine the difference between having access to the world and suddenly having no access whatsoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: Did you .... This information was only available on the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, there was nothing left that was printed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="507">A: What was printed was lies, what was printed was full of legal words, let's say, you had to read between the <span class="dlf">lines</span> and even so, let's say, our heroic forces are conducting defensive battles in such and such <span class="region">area</span>, so we already knew that if they were in that <span class="region">area</span>, they were so many kilometers from the <span class="region">area</span> where they were before, so obviously they are retreating and they have been, they have been retreating, <span class="dlf">lines</span> were broken through and they are doing great wonders but they are 80 kilometers to the rear, or 40 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="508">Sometimes advances were measured, let's say five kilometers, very small, but still. </sentence><sentence id="509">And  9 after that, the next step was, all Jews must wear a 10 centimeter diameter yellow star sewn on their clothes, not just attached and on the penalty of such and such not to remove that star, not to hide it and then Jews could not be out on the <span class="dlf">street</span> after a certain hour in the evening and it was Passover and we went to grandmother's as always for the Passover seder, but this time it was very short and we had to get back <span class="building">home</span> and it was like state of siege. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Couldn't be out, you couldn't be out after dark? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="516">And look out on a Saturday in the <span class="populated place">town</span> and everywhere you see is Hungarian soldiers again with rifles and fixed bayonets and it was just horrible being at <span class="building">home</span> with all this external pressure, internal pressure and my father had the good fortune on January 6 of "44, he had a heart attack, so he was just recuperating when the Germans came in and he was not yet completely and he said let's get to Grandmother's, it was always get to Grandmother, I mean if there was a beating in <span class="building">store</span> or some trap or something, always to Grandmother's, it was like <span class="building">asylum</span> and everything else, it was just a place where I could get understanding, a 02:30 place where I could have love and security and safety. </sentence><sentence id="517">So we sneaked out and somehow we got by the soldiers who were on the corner, my brother and I and we said we're just going to Grandmother's or something and they let us by and then we go down the next <span class="dlf">street</span> and we go down half the <span class="dlf">street</span> and we get intercepted by Hungarian soldiers again and these were draftees, they were older guys, well older, let's say they were like 32 or 33 or which, 35, compared to other soldiers they were older. </sentence><sentence id="518">And we tried to talk to them, he said look, I'll let you through, but suppose you get to the next <span class="dlf">corner</span>, what's going to be there, I mean suppose the guy there stops you and what are you going to say? </sentence><sentence id="519">That I let you through and this and what, said, little kids, go back <span class="building">home</span>, it will be simpler. </sentence><sentence id="520">So, all right, I could, I was then not quite 15, but I could tell a decent man when I saw one and I took his advice and we went back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: At the, in the, away from the center and my mother and my Grandmother in the next <span class="populated place">town</span> also lived at the edge of the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">But he had many patients in the <span class="populated place">villages</span> and somebody, even our cleaning woman could have hidden us, but I don't know, I hate to lose time on somebody else's story, but the cleaning woman told me in "89, when I went back there, that there was a Jewish man in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, a shopkeeper, who had a two year old daughter and he wanted to hide, let's say palm off that daughter to somebody's <span class="building">home</span>, anybody's <span class="building">home</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="626">He knew the villagers, the villagers shopped from him, the villagers knew him and he knew them and he went to them and begged them, because he knew the two year old would be a hindrance, no matter what happened, we did not know what would happen, but a two year old would be a problem and nobody wanted to take in the kid and my cleaning lady said, why should they, I mean the kid will stick out, the kid didn't speak Hungarian, the kid didn't speak Russian, the kid could only speak Yiddish and if one takes it in, somebody's going to inform on that person because everybody had enemies, that's the kind of world it was, everybody had enemies in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, everybody had enemies in the <span class="populated place">town</span> and at first opportunity they informed on other people like that and I said well they could have hid the child somewhere, so, no, nobody wanted the kid. </sentence><sentence id="627">So, naturally the kid got killed in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and so did it's mother. </sentence><sentence id="628">I, coming back to my story, it was just, I was never a boy scout, I never lived in the <span class="country">country</span>, I never did any hiking, I never did any camping, I couldn't live in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> alone, where would I get food? </sentence><sentence id="629">The first peasant who bumped on me in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> would turn me in. </sentence><sentence id="630">Even if they didn't hate Jews, they didn't like Jews and there was just, the only way would have been it, as I said, if I would have been taken out on March the 20th or 19th and given to some place in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and if that person would have been 100 percent loyal and if that person could have gotten me into his <span class="building">house</span> or into his <span class="interior space">cellar</span> without my being seen, our being seen, my brother and I.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="648">A: In <span class="populated place">town</span>, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="649">And one hid by himself in a <span class="interior space">cellar</span> which he had built and he was discovered, but he was discovered after they took away all the Jews already, so as far as I know they took him to an <span class="populated place">interment camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>, but I'm not sure about it. </sentence><sentence id="650">It doesn't matter, really. </sentence><sentence id="651">But anyway, then we were just horribly tired on that April 19th when we arrived at that <span class="building">brick factory</span>, it was already dark, it was night and we haven't eaten all day, but that was a minor point, who cared for eating at a time like this, or who could eat anything at a time like that? </sentence><sentence id="652">At most you were just very thirsty. </sentence><sentence id="653">So we stretched out on the straw, I mean the hay and I finally got up in the morning, there were already <span class="building">guard towers</span> are being built around the <span class="building">brick factory</span>, the <span class="dlf">fence</span> is already being completed, the three meter high <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="654">The one night during which we could have escaped, again, I don't know where to, but we could have escaped, was gone and there was no more after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="665">Tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="666">Tomorrow we'll figure out something. </sentence><sentence id="667">It's something which haunts me to this day, it will haunt me to my dying day, but it could have been done, it wasn't done and then my father started working, he'll do everything to get us out one way or another and started making friends with an SS lieutenant who was in charge of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="668">Stumpfer(ph) or something like, either a captain or the next below the captain in the SS ranks. </sentence><sentence id="669">And he managed to be friends and then he kept us telling, I'll get you out, I'll get you out, so he going to get us out, I started nagging him, I said, you said yesterday you're going to get us out, he said I'm working on it. </sentence><sentence id="670">I says you going to get us out when, when are you going to get us out? </sentence><sentence id="671">And this point I hated him like I have never hated anybody probably and I was just nagging him and he was nagging us, he nagged, when he couldn't beat, when he decided that I was too old to be beaten, he used psychological terror on me and he continued to do that even in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, in the <span class="building">brick factory</span>, he said, I don't know how you two kids will survive, I don't know how you two kids will survive, you are the most unsurviving kids, un, I don't know the English word, I never could figure out the equivalent word for it. </sentence><sentence id="672">Unviable or something like that, you just, you'll just never manage, you'll just never manage and who needs to hear that kind of stuff, I mean? </sentence><sentence id="673">And it certainly doesn't build up your morale, it doesn't strengthen, it doesn't add to your stamina, it doesn't anything and then one day he says run to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, there is a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> going back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, jump on it as soon as you can and you are going out. </sentence><sentence id="674">And that was May 11th, after having me in the <span class="building">brick factory</span> from April 19 until May 11, we jump on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, which used to carry either food or bread or something between the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the <span class="building">brick factory</span> and we got to the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the driver said, these three have permits, my mother and my brother and I and the police who was standing at the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> entrance says okay and through <span class="interior space">back yards</span> and back ways we got to the <span class="building">house</span> where Grandmother was and, which was across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from our original <span class="building">home</span>, but our original <span class="building">home</span> was outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the <span class="dlf">road</span> was the separate <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="675">And this was  4 11th, which was Thursday, I think. </sentence><sentence id="676">Some days one remembers and it was a different world, people were still sleeping in <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, all the <span class="dlf">fences</span> between the <span class="building">houses</span> were torn down, had to be torn down so people could go from one <span class="building">house</span> to another without going out in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and in the <span class="dlf">yard</span> there was a <span class="dlf">trench</span> dug, like maybe two meters deep, <span class="dlf">anti- aircraft trench</span> or <span class="building">shelter</span>, or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="677">All kinds of things just to keep the Jews busy, just to harass them, just to be on their backs all the time and somebody found a <span class="spatial object">sofa</span> for me to sleep in, somebody found a place for my mother and somebody for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="678">And you wouldn't believe this but there was, in that same <span class="building">building</span> there was 02:51: a <span class="building">patisserie</span>, a Jewish woman and she was making ice cream, she still was making ice cream and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> had two sections which were divided by a <span class="dlf">street</span> and people could run across that <span class="dlf">street</span> from one <span class="region">section</span>, <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> one to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> two let's say, with the good will of the police guard and my classmates from <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, the girls were running in on Sunday to this lady who was making the ice cream and Mrs. Such and such, Mrs. Such and such, are you going to make ice cream?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: You couldn't go around, the idea was to keep as low as you can, I stayed in that, just the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="745">I stayed in the <span class="building">home</span> where I was given that <span class="spatial object">sofa</span>, where I could be and it was across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from my own <span class="building">home</span> and I could look out, but I couldn't look out, because they told me, those people, don't go near the <span class="dlf">window</span>, because they have orders that anybody who goes near the <span class="dlf">window</span> will be shot, they will shoot through the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="746">So I didn't want to endanger their lives and they were very nice to me that they gave me a <span class="spatial object">sofa</span> on which to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="747">The only other thing I could mention that, during my stay there in  6 the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, during those four nights, one of my classmates showed up. </sentence><sentence id="748">It turned out he became a messenger in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and it was good to have any position, I mean as long as you had a position, any position was better than no position at all, so he was important, they could send him here and there and he didn't have to dig those <span class="dlf">air raid ditches</span> and he didn't have to be around on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and being beaten and all kinds of things, so he came to me to get my Leventer cap, 02:58 the army cap because they were collecting them, so Jews should not have military caps and there should be no way for them to melt into outside and pretend to be non-Jews and trying to get away. </sentence><sentence id="749">So I told him, the <span class="spatial object">cap</span> is at <span class="building">home</span>, see? </sentence><sentence id="750">Across the <span class="dlf">street</span>? </sentence><sentence id="751">I've no way of getting to it and he told me things. </sentence><sentence id="752">He told me what was going on in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="753">He told me the horrible things which I didn't know about, there was no communication between the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the <span class="building">brick factory</span> and I've been trying to find him and to this day I haven't been able to find him. </sentence><sentence id="754">But he was a soccer player, muscular boy, a lively boy and a go-getter and what anybody would call a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="755">In other words, a hustler, the Hungarians have an expression, he could survive on an <span class="env feature">ice floe</span>, but. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: At the end of the last tape, you started to describe to me the fact that you and your family were taken away from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and driven to the other, the second <span class="building">brick factory</span> on the outside of the <span class="populated place">town</span> where there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> waiting, you could see that there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> waiting, but before you tell me what happened with your father, mother and brother, tell me what you knew at that time about the fate of other Jews that had been either from your <span class="populated place">town</span> or in the <span class="region">region</span>, so what could you imagine might be awaiting you at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="777"> 03:02: </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Hungarian troops were fighting on what was called the <span class="region">eastern front</span> in <span class="country">Russia</span> and so were Jewish labor units were assigned to that <span class="region">front</span> and they were being used there to dig up mines planted by the Russians or dig <span class="dlf">trenches</span> or any kind of work and sometimes the Hungarian troops used to come <span class="building">home</span> on sick leave or something like that and they talked and they told us things which were going on in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span>, mainly in the <span class="country">Ukraine</span> because that's where these troops were. </sentence><sentence id="779">And there were people sometimes coming over from <span class="country">Poland</span> into our <span class="region">area</span>, civilians and they talked and they told us, again, they told somebody and word got around and these were people whom you could trust, in other words, these were, we knew that these were fact, that these things were true. </sentence><sentence id="780">They told us that in <span class="country">Poland</span> the Jews were massacred in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, that they were dumped into <span class="dlf">mass graves</span> and that the <span class="env feature">earth</span> was moving on top of the <span class="dlf">grave</span> for weeks after the shootings, after the killings, that not all of them were completely killed and the ones who came back from the <span class="region">Russian front</span>, they apparently must have met Einsatztruppen or saw them in action, they said the Jews were taken out from the <span class="populated place">town</span> to a <span class="dlf">field</span> outside the <span class="populated place">town</span> and they were rounded up and all of them were brought together and they were surrounded and then the Germans mounted the machine gun on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and they were circling around these surrounded people and they were machine- gunning them and as long as they kept on circling them and firing into them until they assumed that everybody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="781">So we knew about this. </sentence><sentence id="782">Then, one of the things which the Hungarians started early, was this stuff about citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="783">And that was, in all case, we had to get the papers so we could get passports, and we were trying to get passports so we could come, even still in 1940 we were trying to get somehow to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="784">It was war was in Europe, but <span class="country">United States</span> was not yet at war. </sentence><sentence id="785">So we were rounding up our ancestors papers, birth certificates of great-grandparents and going back to the middle of the 19th century or early 19th century so we could prove that we lived, 03:05: our ancestors lived in that <span class="region">area</span>, that we did not infiltrate from <span class="country">Poland</span>, that we were local Jews and we got Hungarian citizenship, we got passports, but they got us nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="786">But there were other Jews who did come in from <span class="country">Poland</span>, probably, I'm not sure how it was, but I'll presume that during the <span class="country">Austro-Hungarian empire</span>, at which time <span class="region">Galicia</span> was part of the empire, there was no <span class="country">Poland</span>, it was partitioned, people from there, probably for to improve their lot economically or somehow, moved from <span class="region">Galicia</span> into <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span> or maybe even into  8 <span class="country">Hungary</span> proper and naturally these people could not prove their citizenship and the Hungarians knew who they were, they always knew who it was, who, I didn't mention to you that already at age 12, the same as I had to belong to the Leventers(ph), I had to have an ID card and since I was Jewish, on it was in red letter Z, for Zido, so they had track of everybody and they knew who these people were who didn't have citizenship and one day, again backtracking, the war broke out in 1941 with <span class="country">Russia</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span> attacked <span class="country">Russia</span> and <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and the Hungarians, which were closely tied to <span class="country">Germany</span> and the military especially, the officers and higher ranks, the staff, they were all completely pro-German. </sentence><sentence id="787">They found an excuse, they created an excuse, it was a phony bombing raid on <span class="populated place">Kosice</span>, which was carried out by <span class="spatial object">German planes</span> and they said that it was bombed by <span class="spatial object">Soviet planes</span> and immediately <span class="country">Hungary</span> declared war on the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and attacked. </sentence><sentence id="788">And Hungarian army units, let's say an entire army was assigned to move in to the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="789">So once <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> was attacked, vast <span class="interior space">spaces</span> became <span class="dlf">killing grounds</span>, where nobody counted for anything, I mean they could murder Russian civilians, Ukranian civilians and was the start of the extermination of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="790">It was, while they were reluctant to do something like that in <span class="country">Germany</span> proper, didn't want to have the German people see things like that, once they were in the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, there were no more holds, no holds barred and there were just, they had complete freedom to murder and do anything they wanted and in any way the wanted, and that's how these so-called Polish Jews who were in our <span class="region">area</span> were loaded up onto <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span> and shipped into <span class="country">Poland</span> and eventually word got back that they were all murdered. </sentence><sentence id="791">Years after the war, when I started doing research, I found where they were murdered and how and what and it was a place called <span class="populated place">Kamenetz Podolsk</span>, the <span class="populated place">Kamenetz Podolsk</span> massacre. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: Were these people all known to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="810">A: To me and to my family, but there were thousands of other Jews who never knew about this, the Jews in the <span class="populated place">villages</span> did not have access to all this kind of information. </sentence><sentence id="811">Some of the Jews in our <span class="populated place">town</span> did not have access to it and you just, more or less you had to be in the know. </sentence><sentence id="812">There was a dentist in our <span class="building">building</span>, he rented his <span class="building">offices</span> and his <span class="interior space">home apartment</span> from us and he got drafted. </sentence><sentence id="813">When he got drafted they were still taking Jews into the army, the Hungarians and again it was inconsistent, some Jews were taken into the Hungarian army and others were immediately put into the labor battalions and the labor, forced labor units and somehow he was in <span class="country">Poland</span> and when his <span class="spatial object">unit</span> was rotated, he came <span class="building">home</span> and he brought back 03:10: some things, among them were miniature Torahs. </sentence><sentence id="814">In Europe there are such things and it's, I had one when I was a child, my Grandmother gave me one, it was a small one and he says, the Jews were being taken away in the <span class="populated place">town</span> where he was in <span class="country">Poland</span> and he says that <span class="dlf">streets</span>  9 were just littered with all kinds of things which they couldn't carry any more and where they were being taken, we didn't find out the details until later. </sentence><sentence id="815">What happened to them, but they were just rounded up and chased, driven like stampede and taken away and then there were other inklings, like somebody had a relative in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> and the Jews from <span class="country">Slovakia</span> were taken away and for a while there were letters and then there were, in the letters there were words which we could understand, but the censors missed them. </sentence><sentence id="816">And from that, oh let's say, oh everything is fine, we're living fine, only the "moveth" [death] is with us, which meant that, things of that sort, or they threw in a Hungarian word which meant bad, very bad. </sentence><sentence id="817">And then there were no more letters. </sentence><sentence id="818">Same way I had, through marriage we knew some people, we were close with them, my mother's sister was married to a man whose relatives were in <span class="country">Poland</span>, lived in <span class="country">Poland</span> and somehow they used to get letters from there. </sentence><sentence id="819">I imagine the letters had to be smuggled out and mailed, remailed by some Christian, Polish friends, because there was no mail coming out of <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="820">And then the letters stopped. </sentence><sentence id="821">And then you had these rumors and words coming in from troops, who came on leave, as I said and things were sort of, one thing was corroborating another. </sentence><sentence id="822">And then in 1943, there was some Jewish holiday, maybe it was Rosh Hashanah or something like that and there was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> again, a long <span class="spatial object">train</span> at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, of <span class="spatial object">freight cars</span> and they were Jews from <span class="country">Italy</span> and they were being shipped to <span class="country">Poland</span> by the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span>, whole loads of them and you can look at the map, see where is <span class="populated place">Munkacevo</span> and where is let's say <span class="populated place">Rome</span>, from where these people were being taken away and how long they been on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and it was warm, it was September and it was very warm and they were crying and screaming for <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: No, but I know from people. </sentence><sentence id="840">I'm giving you second hand information, but it's reliable. </sentence><sentence id="841">I wouldn't repeat it if it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="842">And girls from my <span class="populated place">town</span> were, one ought to have his hat off to them, they were running all over <span

holiday and it was not a day to cook food, but some nevertheless relented and these girls did everything possible and they took it out in cans and pitchers and whatever and the guards wouldn't let it on, the guards wouldn't let them give it to the people in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, they wouldn't open the <span class="dlf">door</span>, they wouldn't let them give water, they wouldn't anything. </sentence><sentence id="843">And there was, all you had to do was say <span class="country">Poland</span> and we knew what it meant, I mean to us it meant extermination of Jews en

about the shootings in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and I should mention this one, in "43 a Slovak boy appeared in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, a young boy about barely 12 at that time, I was 14 and rumor had it that he was rescued from <span class="country">Poland</span>, that he was taken from <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, with the whole <span class="populated place">town</span>, with all the people, together with his family and everything and the way the story was that the Germans tied them together by fours and they fired one shot through the four <span class="spatial object">bodies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">And the kid was shorter than the ones in front of them and the bullet went over his head or grazed his head and they all keeled over and they brought in some <span class="spatial object">burial units</span> to bury them and the kid was the only one alive in that whole people, the whole group(?)_ </sentence><sentence id="846">were murdered. </sentence><sentence id="847">And somehow Hungarian soldiers or Jewish labor units hid him and somehow they found  0 out that he had a grandmother or a grand-aunt living in <span class="populated place">Munkacz_</span> and they smuggled him into <span class="populated place">town</span> and the 03:17 Hungarians found out about it and somehow they didn't extradite him and they didn't arrest him and they let him stay there and I heard this and I was a very nosy or curious kid and I used to walk all over <span class="populated place">town</span>, one of the things my father insisted on, I should go on walks to get exercise, to be on fresh <span class="env feature">air</span>, so I knew the whole <span class="populated place">town</span>, every <span class="dlf">street</span>, every <span class="building">house</span>, every <span class="region">section</span> and I knew where the kid was, so that day I went walking to the <span class="dlf">street</span> where the kid was and I was trying to get a glimpse of him, even behind his <span class="dlf">fence</span>, there was a <span class="dlf">fence</span> which you couldn't see through it, somehow and I kept loitering there until I got a glimpse of him that I could say that I saw the kid. </sentence><sentence id="848">When were taken to the <span class="building">brick factory</span>, the kid was arrested and taken to the <span class="building">brick factory</span>, he didn't go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with the grandmother, he was taken to the <span class="building">brick factory</span> and just saying this doesn't illustrate anything, point, but I don't know what happened to him after that. </sentence><sentence id="849">So getting back to, the two <span class="building">brick factories</span> were called, one was belonged to the Kaloush(ph), a person named Kaloush(ph) and the other one belonged to his father-in-law named Shyowitz(ph), so we were originally in the <span class="building">Kaloush(ph) factory</span>, which was at one end of the <span class="populated place">town</span> and we were taken to the Shyowitz(ph), from where there were, that Hungarian police captain handed us over to this police officer, the Hungarian told him to give us a going over, for which purpose he had a, favorite beating instrument in <span class="country">Hungary</span> is a <span class="spatial object">bull's penis</span>, which is, which they dry out and it cannot be broken, in other words they can beat and beat and beat a person with it and it will not split like a piece of wood or a stick and that was their favorite, so this one had one of those and he started beating us, for any odd way and we were standing there and like 20 feet from us was the <span class="dlf">railroad siding</span> and the <span class="spatial object">freight train</span> and we knew that we were going to be loaded on that <span class="spatial object">freight train</span> and probably to <span class="country">Poland</span> and probably shot and massacred or something. </sentence><sentence id="850">But there were all these rumors, there were all these rumors circulating and spread deliberately that the Jews from <span class="country">Hungary</span> would be taken to inside <span class="country">Hungary</span> for labor. </sentence><sentence id="851">But nobody knew where, or what. </sentence><sentence id="852">So 03:20 we were being beaten there and beaten and then SS, who were inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the whole <span class="building">brick factory</span> was supervised by maybe four SS. </sentence><sentence id="853">They were able to handle 4,000 prisoners and one of them came by and gave my father a beating and he had a walking stick, which was diameter this thick and he just used that for beating. </sentence><sentence id="854">And we were already waiting to get away from all this beating and be put on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="855">And finally the hour came and they put us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and then of course they locked the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, it was one of these rolling <span class="dlf">gates</span> and I don't know how much time went by there and they opened the <span class="dlf">gate</span> and they shove in an old, white haired woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: My mother knew her, I did not know her and she said, Wazari(ph) is my son-in-law, he will get me out. </sentence><sentence id="888">So we sit there and we sit there in the dark and warmth and it was a sunny day and the sun burning on this locked up <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> and then late afternoon, noise outside, screaming, yelling, shouting and you could hear beating and they open the <span class="dlf">gates</span> to our <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> and they put a <span class="dlf">ramp</span> through it and people are running in, mobs and running and pushed in, I mean they are beating the ones behind who are pushing the ones in front and the man is yelling, but there are people here already, we're supposed to be 80 in the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> and three others came in addition, because they wanted to be with us because of families and there are already five people here, we are 88. </sentence><sentence id="889">Shut up. </sentence><sentence id="890">And they told him, you are in charge and you make sure that nobody escapes and everybody gets to their destination all right. </sentence><sentence id="891">So he said, I'm in charge and he accepted that and he thought he was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="892">So when it started getting dark somebody came to the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, to the <span class="spatial object">freight car</span> and we are just sitting there all crowded up, 88 of us in this small <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span>, I mean it was not meant to hold 88 people or 80 or 8, it was, during World War 1, they used those <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> to carry 40 soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="893">At that time it was 40 soldiers or eight horses. </sentence><sentence id="894">Now it was like the Germans could shove in like anything from 80 to 100 Jews into one of those, half suffocated them or what, didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="895">So, and there was one 03:24: other clue. </sentence><sentence id="896">My father was frisked before he was taken from the <span class="building">Kaloush</span> to the <span class="building">Shyowitz</span> and they gave him a beating there and they took away his watch and he was protesting that he has need the watch to take pulse of, he's a doctor and he need it for that. </sentence><sentence id="897">He says to him, where you going, you won't be needing that watch. </sentence><sentence id="898">So again, indecipherable clues and then somebody came by after it got dark and got to the, where there was a little <span class="dlf">gap</span> in the <span class="dlf">door</span> that's gaped and he said, are the Havas's in this <span class="spatial object">car</span>? </sentence><sentence id="899">He says, yes. </sentence><sentence id="900">Says I saw you when you were brought in, do you need anything? </sentence><sentence id="901">Because we were just like they grabbed us off the <span class="dlf">street</span> or out of anywhere, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="902">So we whispered to him, can you get us a coat or two, extra coats or something and most important for my father, toothbrushes, toothbrushes and toothpaste and there was one other thing. </sentence><sentence id="903">My father had one sensible idea when we were still at <span class="building">home</span> and they were going to kill all of us, the morphine. </sentence><sentence id="904">He got together what he considered would be a lethal dose for the four of us and injections and he kept it in a <span class="spatial object">steel case</span> in which doctors usually keep instruments and stuff like that, but he kept postponing it, kept postponing it. </sentence><sentence id="905"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Did he tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: Yeah, we were all in on it and we all had to agree to it and when they were taking us away, when we didn't know where on April 19th, when we were being taken to the <span class="building">brick factory</span> but we didn't know where, I said make sure you get the morphine, make sure you take it with us. </sentence><sentence id="933">So he grabbed that <span class="spatial object">box</span> with all the stuff in it and then of course we got separated from it, because they grabbed him from the <span class="building">Kaloush factory</span> and they frisked him and beat him up and they put him in that <span class="spatial object">car</span> with the police captain, that was the end of the morphine, so I said, we said to him, get them from the <span class="building">medic station</span> to get your morphine. </sentence><sentence id="934">So they did not know what it was for, they figure it was for pain killing and they brought a cassette for injections, I mean syringes and morphine ampules and said how much did you get, he said, not enough even for one person, to kill one person. </sentence><sentence id="935">So, that was that. </sentence><sentence id="936">And so and this guy did bring us and when we asked for something else he said, wait until it gets darker because I'm afraid to come by and I'll get caught, I'll be badly, I'll get it badly. </sentence><sentence id="937">So then he brought one thing at one time and another thing at another time, I mean that's what we had and it was all and two of the things he brought us from somebody, he got two raincoats, which were light, lightweight, what we used to call balloon coats and that's how I recognized myself on that picture in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, in that raincoat and it's light, it's like off-white, or beige color and it sticks out among all those other people who are in black or dark clothes. </sentence><sentence id="938">And so we are all in this thing, in this <span class="spatial object">shut-up wagon</span> and now we are waiting, when is the <span class="spatial object">train</span> going to be starting to pull out and sometime during the night, it started to pull out and then watch which way is it going. </sentence><sentence id="939">We knew all the names of the <span class="populated place">villages</span> in the <span class="region">area</span> and we watched and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was going from <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> to a <span class="dlf">railroad junction</span>. </sentence><sentence id="940">I think it was <span class="populated place">Chop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="941">So we knew that we couldn't go, we could be heading anywhere from <span class="populated place">Chopt</span> because it was a <span class="dlf">junction point</span>, but we knew by then that we were not going north, directly to <span class="country">Poland</span> where the killings took place, so next thing we see was somebody, a <span class="dlf">crack</span> in the <span class="dlf">door</span> where it's not closed completely, you could see that name, I think it may have been <span class="populated place">Kosice</span> which is_ to the <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="942">The next thing we know, we're in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, which is odd, because all the Slovakian Jews were taken away already, why would they take the Hungarian Jews to <span class="country">Slovakia</span>? </sentence><sentence id="943">And then people in the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, putting their heads together, or quote unquote heads, nobody had a head and at this point in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped and the SS came in and the SS took over the guarding of the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, so I presume that, although we didn't see them, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> up to that point was guarded either by Hungarian armed gendarmes or Hungarian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="944">And at that point, this is unbelievable, the SS permitted, opened all the <span class="dlf">gates</span> on all the <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> and it said, from each <span class="spatial object">car</span> one person out with a bucket for water. </sentence><sentence id="945">And then they did it again, it was a <span class="dlf">line-up</span>, it was a <span class="building">railroad station</span> with a <span class="spatial object">pump</span> and they could pump just so much and maybe four or five <span class="spatial object">cars</span> got water, all right, that's it, everybody back in, up, up, get into your <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and <span class="dlf">gates</span> being shut and locked up and off we go. </sentence><sentence id="946">And then we were watching, which way now, which way now and this was already <span class="region">foreign territory</span>, we did not know the names of  3 the 03:31 <span class="populated place">Slovak villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="947">And then we keep on watching and the we're in <span class="country">Poland</span>, crossing from <span class="country">Slovakia</span> into <span class="country">Poland</span>, we recognized some Polish names, <span class="populated place">Polish village</span>, but now knowing whereabouts it is and then we started saying, now are we going to go east to the <span class="dlf">killing grounds</span> or <span class="region">west</span>? </sentence><sentence id="948">So we keep on watching, and these are <span class="populated place">foreign towns</span>, but we later, one way or another, by the lay of the sun or what, we figured out we are going west. </sentence><sentence id="949">The relief, I mean they are not taking us to the <span class="dlf">fields</span> where they are shooting them and burying them in <span class="dlf">mass graves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="950">And we left on Monday the 15th and during the night on the 15th and it had to be on the 17th, we arrive at a <span class="building">station</span> in the middle of the night and from the <span class="dlf">cracks</span> we could see out, <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>, which was in <span class="region">western Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="951">So it was, why <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>? </sentence><sentence id="952">We did not know anything, we had no idea what was going on or where or why and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stands there and then it's being shuttled from one <span class="dlf">track</span> to another <span class="dlf">track</span>, to another <span class="dlf">track</span>, to another <span class="dlf">track</span> and shuttled back and what was front is now moving back. </sentence><sentence id="953">In the morning we end up someplace and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stops and there's no more movement and I should add this, that the ride and the thirst, without water, the crowding, the people crowded together, squeezed together, you couldn't lie down, you could only sit on your haunches and people more or less urinating in front of each other, defecating in front of each other, the smell, horrible feeling, it just, kids crying and little ones and I was in the middle of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> with a woman, I don't know maybe in the forties and she didn't have a nose, just horrible looking. </sentence><sentence id="954">I asked my father what it was, he said she had TB of the nose. </sentence><sentence id="955">A horrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="956">So we are at the place, at an unknown place and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is stopped there and there's no more movement and we don't know where we are and then the sun is coming up and daylight and the <span class="dlf">train gates</span> are being opened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1118">Is that going to make a difference to you? </sentence><sentence id="1119">Says, well they told us that they was going to take it away anyway, they're going to take away our shoes anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1120">So most of us told him then, gave him the answer, he says, will they take it away? </sentence><sentence id="1121">Until they take it away, I'll have it. </sentence><sentence id="1122">I'm not trading with you. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And they were asking us for news from the outside world and we told them they took away our <span class="spatial object">radios</span> a month and a half ago and we didn't know anything what's going on and until then what we knew, the news was not that great. </sentence><sentence id="1124">The Soviets, the <span class="dlf">Red Armny</span> is just barely touching <span class="country">Romania</span>, they're nowhere anywhere near. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1126">So and we were in formation there all day, just standing there and standing there and standing  8 there. </sentence><sentence id="1127">There were <span class="interior space">space</span> between the, these <span class="building">buildings</span> or <span class="building">sheds</span> or <span class="building">storage buildings</span> and in the morning they counted us, an SS counted us and in the evening they counted us. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Now it was very important how many there are. </sentence><sentence id="1129">By the way, it didn't matter to anybody if there were 88 of us in that <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> when we arrived and I just couldn't understand them because it was so important that 88 people should be in it, that nobody should escape and here it didn't matter any more, no not at all. </sentence><sentence id="1130">It was just one absurd thing after another, it was like a world completely topsy-turvy, it was just. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And when we were standing there naked, waiting to be processed or whatever, the women run by naked, screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1132">The same, our women who got separated from us and who didn't have children and who were selected for labor, but my mother told me many a year later, she says, I saw you, but I was naked and you were naked so I wouldn't say anything, _-?_-- or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And then eventually an SS who was processing them and who was chasing them to the <span class="interior space">shower</span>, he pulled down the curtains for them so they wouldn't have to be there, exposed, naked. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Which again, so unlike an <span class="spatial object">SS</span>, that he had some consideration. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1202">A: We arrived there on Thursday, the 18th and we stayed there until Friday, which was the 26th, I believe and during that time we were like, my brother and me among total strangers or since, I didn't mention before that by being rushed to this Shyowitz(ph) <span class="building">brick factory</span>, I got into a <span class="spatial object">train</span> which was like 99 percent people from the <span class="populated place">villages</span> were brought in, so I did not know anybody there and they didn't know me. </sentence><sentence id="1203">There were very few people actually from <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> itself on that <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So, as my father's group got moved out, others moved in, then somebody else got again moved out, so it was rotation and mixing and all that and then on Friday they emptied our entire <span class="building">building</span> or <span class="building">barracks</span> and they marched us to the same <span class="dlf">railroad platform</span> or <span class="building">station</span> where we were unloaded except now we were on the other side of it, there were three <span class="dlf">tracks</span> there and we came in on the, facing outward on this side and now we were lining up on this side and in front of us was a <span class="spatial object">train</span> of <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> and again we were just standing in front of them and this time they were counting 50 of us in <span class="building">prison</span> uniforms into each <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span> and they gave us bread and water for the trip and the guards this time were soldiers like I've never seen before either in life or in pictures. </sentence><sentence id="1205">They were what the Germans call Marine Soldaten, in other words like marine soldiers, but they were older and we were very glad that they were not SS because we just feared the SS very much, we knew them from reputation, what they were. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And we saw them, what they did in the <span class="building">brick factory</span> too, it was real bad. </sentence><sentence id="1207">So anyway, you think that getting into these <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span> only 50 of us would be a little more spacious, whereas compared to 88, but it wasn't, because the guards decided to divide, well they didn't decide it, but it worked out that that was the arrangement, the guards were in the middle, they had one-third of the <span class="spatial object">car</span> to the two guards and one third to 25 prisoners and the other third to 25 prisoners, so you can figure out the, and we were sitting again, all pulled up on our haunches and as it was getting dark at night, we started finally inching out our legs to see if the guards will react or if they're going to let us stretch out a little bit and they did let us stretch out and as soon as it was daylight, started yelling and, get back, get back and so we had to pull back and again crowd into each other's stomachs and against each other and just sit there and sit and sit and on late Saturday night, somewhere on Saturday, we arrived again 04:05 someplace and <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped and next morning they opened the <span class="dlf">gates</span> and now SS men, wild looking SS get into the <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, the Marine Soldaten are going away and these are young, vicious looking ones, with submachine guns on the shoulder, not rifles like the Marine Soldaten had, these are armed for close shooting and making a massacre of anything if there's any trouble and I knew what those kind of weapons were, that's all, maybe somebody else didn't, but I knew what they could do. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And eventually they unload us, everybody out of the <span class="spatial object">box cars</span> and then I see on the <span class="building">stationhouse</span> there's <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Again I use some mmemonic device to memorize that name. </sentence><sentence id="1210">It was <span class="building">seed distributor</span> in <span class="country">Hungary</span> and it was called <span class="building">Mautner</span> and everybody knew the <span class="building">Mautner</span> seeds and they were in existence for  1 generations, so <span class="populated place">Maut</span> and <span class="populated place">hausen</span> like in <span class="populated place">Muenchhausen</span> or something, so could remember that name. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And then they started marching us and it's a long march on pebbly <span class="dlf">roads</span> and <span class="dlf">secondary roads</span> and first through a <span class="populated place">village</span> and then through a <span class="region">countryside</span> and <span class="dlf">roads</span> and turned out that, I found this out already in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, that my brother had a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in the sole of his shoe and while we were waiting to be loaded onto the <span class="spatial object">train</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I saw piles of empty cartons or cases from lamps, light bulbs, which, they were always changing the light bulbs in the <span class="dlf">electric fence</span>, the lighting so nothing would ever burn out or get disconnected or something, but and there were piles of these so I put some of those in my pocket for future use and to put my margarine into it and so I stuffed several of those into my brother's shoe so there would be something between the pebbles of the <span class="dlf">road</span> and the sharp stones and his feet, but it didn't help much and he was just in pain and crying and he was hot, it was warm, very bright sun and we were thirsty and it was a long march and hard and SS on both sides and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1212">So finally we got to the camp <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, which was a very, I don't know, forbidding looking place, the whole, the <span class="dlf">walls</span> again, they're not temporary, they were made, built from granite stone and they were like maybe two and a half meters high or three meters high and on the top of the <span class="dlf">stone fence</span> there were strips of <span class="dlf">barb wire</span> again, like maybe five strips and again with the insulators to let you know that they were electrified and it took the better part of a day to get processed there and again somebody came, a German prisoner and picked out the younger ones and you go, you stay over here and among those was my brother and I tried to yank him back to the group where I was and the guy spotted it and he pulled him out again. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And then I tried to go, I tried to sneak into that group and he spotted me and pulled me back and I tried one more time and he said, you try it one more time and you'll get it. </sentence><sentence id="1214">So that was the last time I saw my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And the other thing I was curious about, they were doing <span class="spatial object">showers</span>, we were taking into the <span class="interior space">shower</span>, which was underground at <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, into a <span class="building">building</span>, a <span class="building">stone building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I was very curious to see if anybody's coming out of those <span class="spatial object">showers</span> or if those are the <span class="spatial object">Auschwitz type showers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1217">And I didn't want to go in, I was waiting, again it was odd that they should have taken us that far by <span class="spatial object">train</span> just to kill us now, but at this point there were so many inconsistencies and so many irrational, one thing after another, that I wasn't sure any more about anything and when I saw them coming out I went in and then the <span class="spatial object">shower</span> could hold, I guess maybe 25-30 people, it was not a big <span class="interior space">room</span> like some places, like <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> had for example, or some others. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And they were yelling and somehow I managed to stay through two or three showerings, you know, was new groups came in and others went out and I was mixed in with the rest and I enjoyed the hot water and when I came out, our shoes were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1219">They were good shoes, so a fellow, brother Jew stole them and left in their place their worn out, horrible pair. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Made a good deal. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And then some of us were taken together and marched into a separate <span class="building">barracks</span>, which was separated from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, again by this very high <span class="dlf">stone wall</span> and the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> on top of it and we had one <span class="interior space">room</span> in that <span class="building">barracks</span> and we were sleeping on maybe straw <span class="spatial object">sacks</span> on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and they were lining us up like sardines, head to foot, head to foot and squeezing, there were 500 of us. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And we were in that <span class="building">barracks</span> a whole week, or let's say from Sunday until Friday afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1223">On Friday afternoon, they marched us  2 to the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and loaded us, not into <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>, but into a regular <span class="spatial object">civilian train</span>, which again, I never met anybody who was taken anywhere in <span class="country">Germany</span>, I mean a prisoner, on <span class="spatial object">civilian train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And this was one of those where every <span class="interior space">compartment</span> had a <span class="dlf">door</span> opening to the outside, where the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> which we are used to in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and in <span class="country">Hungary</span>, had a <span class="dlf">corridor</span> from which the <span class="interior space">compartments</span> opened in to and one SS gets into each <span class="spatial object">train</span>, each <span class="spatial object">car</span> and he says, nobody move because I'm going to shoot without warning. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And we're sitting like five across the <span class="spatial object">wooden benches</span>, like normal civilians, unbelievable, no crowding, nobody sitting on top of anybody else and you can sit and he said sit at attention and don't try to move, don't talk and the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went through one <span class="populated place">town</span> and stayed there in the <span class="building">railroad station</span> for a long time and then got going again and we arrived at a place and there on the <span class="building">station</span> it said Ebensee(ph), again I never heard of Ebensee(ph) today before, never heard of <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> before. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And they unload us, again, new SS get on, pick us up, take over and march us a good distance into, up <span class="dlf">hill</span> into another place, a <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1227">We get into this <span class="populated place">camp</span> and it's like virtually hidden in a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1228">The <span class="building">barracks</span> are surrounded by <span class="env feature">trees</span> and there are cut down <span class="env feature">trees</span> tossed on the tops of the <span class="building">barracks</span>, on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span>, to conceal them further. </sentence><sentence id="1229">And just enough <span class="interior space">space</span> 4:14 cut down for the <span class="building">barrack</span> and <span class="env feature">trees</span> on either side, <span class="env feature">trees</span> all around and again processing and sorting and you go here and the two men with whom I became friendly or one man with whom I became friendly a <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, we stayed together somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And he was an attorney in <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> and was a very nice person. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And again that was fortunate for me that I met him and that he was that nice. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And after sorting and being checked by an SS doctor, again undressed naked and a floodlight on you to see what shape you are in and he picked out I don't know how many of us and we got assigned to one <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1233">We find out when we are there that we are working in <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> on a rotating shift and eight hour shift and our shift happened to start on Sunday night at 11. </sentence><sentence id="1234">So it would be from 11 until 7 in the morning working in the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> work was, we had no idea what it's for or what weird looking thing, a <span class="env feature">mountain</span> and into it are cut <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>, one after another, like maybe seven or eight <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> and they told us, you are working in <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> seven, remember that and the outfit for which you are working is Holtzmann-Polanski(ph) and those same <span class="building">firms</span> are still existing in <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1272">Q: , these were tall <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>? </sentence><sentence id="1273"> 3 deeper and there's one section of </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1276"> 04:17 the <span class="dlf">rail</span> which is a <span class="dlf">switching point</span> where there are two <span class="dlf">tracks</span> and you can switch from one <span class="dlf">track</span> to another and that weighed a ton, it was steel and it was grabbing all around it and lifting it up and as always in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, nobody was, somebody was always getting out from carrying his load, so the next one carried twice as much. </sentence><sentence id="1277">That was the hardest part in it and the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> was cold and damp and the <span class="env feature">water</span> was coming in between the <span class="env feature">rocks</span> at some places and it was night and noise and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1278">I worked there for a week and a new <span class="spatial object">transport</span> of Jews came to Ebensee(ph) and they got picked through and I got out of that <span class="building">barracks</span> and I got to a day time job and others got assigned to the night time shift. </sentence><sentence id="1279">So another 500 transported, 500. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And so I did all kinds of work in Ebensee(ph) and when we come back in the evening from the work, there's a command yelling out, all Jews out, in other words in the evening they used to have head counts and in the morning the head counts and the formations standing and standing until everybody got counted and after everybody was counted then we could go to the <span class="building">barracks</span> and get supper, or a loaf of bread, I mean a section of bread and some margarine or something, whatever came with it, you know, sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And then this time, all Jews out, stay on the place and you're not going back to the <span class="building">barracks</span> and suddenly we are surrounded by what I call the beaters, these were the way some people earn their living by being barbers in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> or being block chiefs, these are, earn their living by beating other prisoners and turned out that there was a huge pile or several huge piles of pre-fabricated barracks sections and we were supposed to take those <span class="dlf">sections</span> and carry them on our shoulders to the back of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> where a new <span class="building">barracks</span> would be built. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And these sections weighed a ton and they were beating us with heavy hoses and sticks until we picked it up, like they used to beat horses in <span class="populated place">Munkacz</span> until they started pulling their load, they beat them. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And again the same thing, the little guy up front made like he's carrying, but he was walking under it, fellow Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And then when we got near his <span class="building">barracks</span>, he just bolted and dashed away and the rest of us got for sure stuck with a whole section of that thing. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And then some of these sections had <span class="dlf">holes</span> in them for <span class="dlf">windows</span>, so again it was impossible to carry the even load, one section was heavy as a ton and the other ones was just a frame of the <span class="dlf">window</span> and as it turned out, the <span class="building">building</span> was supposed, turned out to be later on, the <span class="building">Jewish hospital barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1286">So just again coincidence and irony or whatever you want to call it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1298">Q: In the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, was it majority Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1300">A: No, that was another thing, let me get to that, we were the first Jews in <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> who were kept for labor, who were not killed within three days. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Up to that point, all Jews who reached <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> were murdered within three days. </sentence><sentence id="1302">If they were not dead by the third day, the SS started to make jokes at them, he says, you like it here, how come you're still alive, this place agrees with you? </sentence><sentence id="1303">This I only find out later, but anyway, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was full of all kinds of nationalities, there were at that time when we arrived there, maybe 5500, there  4 were Russian POW's, Soviet Red Army POW's, there were Polish civilians, Russian civilians, there were Frenchmen. </sentence><sentence id="1304">There was a handful of Spaniards from the civil war, who the Germans captured somehow, one way or another from <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">France</span> turned them over to the Germans and there were Italians and there were a handful of Czechs and maybe one or two Greeks and that was it, so we were the first Jews in <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> [not correct] and the first Jews in Ebensee(ph) and getting back to these <span class="interior space">building sections</span>, when we finally reached the bottom one, under it was snow, in the middle of June. </sentence><sentence id="1305">In other words, these shipments arrived in the winter, Ebensee(ph) was being, they started building it in November "43, we got there on the second of June and these piles of sections, of pre-fabricated sections were there since November or December and the winters were such that there was still snow on the <span class="env feature">mountain</span> across from Ebensee(ph) when we got there and it was not until July or August when it finally melted, so it was a cool place. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And one thing I definitely want to mention is the stealing in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, stealing of the food by the ones who distributed it and the stealing of the food by fellow prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And I would say the Jews were probably, if not the worst, very close to it as far as stealing. </sentence><sentence id="1308">My bread got stolen many times until (finally ?) </sentence><sentence id="1309">and I cried and some of the other fellows told me, he said look, it's not such a big piece of bread that you couldn't eat it in one sitting, so why don't you eat it in the evening as soon as you get it and that way it will be in your stomach and not in somebody else's. </sentence><sentence id="1310">So I finally learned my lesson, from then on I did it that way, but there again was one so called good advice from my father, always save some for the next day, which in this case, like so many other of his advices turned out to be not quite suitable for the place and the time. </sentence><sentence id="1311">It just was not that type of a world and as far as stealing by the chiefs, it was like this, the <span class="building">barracks</span>, in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> they knew for each <span class="building">barracks</span>, how many prisoners were in each <span class="building">barracks</span> and they filled the, I don't know what you want to call it, the <span class="spatial object">containers</span> that, some of them could hold 25 liters, some of them could hold 50 liters and they filled them accordingly so everybody would get one liter of soup and the soup was mostly vegetables, but were vegetables, it's not like green beans and stuff like that, there was turnips beets and related things. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Occasionally you were lucky if you find a small, found a small piece of potato and sometimes, very rarely, you found some piece of meat in there, but very rarely. </sentence><sentence id="1313">And anyway, there was, in addition to the number of liters, they always gave some extra for the chiefs in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, so they would have more food than the peons or ordinary prisoners, but it was not enough for them, the extra what was being shipped to them, they used to, first of all, as soon as the <span class="spatial object">containers</span> arrived, the block chief went in with the <span class="spatial object">ladle</span> and got from the bottom of it, where the good stuff settled and gave one for myself, one for you, one for the clerk and one for the Kapo and one for this and take them inside. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And then he says, oh here's one more for this one and one more for that one and then he started ladling out and then he stirred it up a little bit, what was left. </sentence><sentence id="1315">So what we were getting was already thinner, because he picked out the best from the bottom and then again, he watched your face and if he liked you, he dipped into the bottom and he gave you that way, if he didn't like you, he just put in from top and you got broth or you got very few floating vegetables or something like that and it was just, every bite meant a lot and you were being robbed by this one,  5 you were being robbed by that one and it was just a very, very bad world and a very bad situation. </sentence><sentence id="1316">And one of the things with the shoe, when I got the bad shoe, when we got to Ebensee(ph), we got assigned to a <span class="building">barracks</span> right away, happened to be a friendly Polish guy there, a young one, who did not have a <span class="building">prison</span> uniform tailored to his body and was just a regular <span class="building">prison</span> jacket, but he had a black cap, which was another sign of rank, which they all loved to wear. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I don't know how they managed to get them, or where they got them, but anybody with any rank has to have a black cap, a black hat with a visor. </sentence><sentence id="1318">So he said, you need shoe, I'll get you a shoe. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So he gave me a wooden shoe, I mean a shoe with a wooden sole and kind of strong, I don't know what you want to call it, plastic material or something on the top and I don't know at which point I got them, either in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or at Ebensee(ph) or <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> where I got a pair of foot rags to wear inside the shoes and we all had those in place of socks, nobody had socks, we had rags, you wrapped your feet in rags. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And these shoes which he gave me were lined with felt and I thought the felt would be good enough, I wouldn't have to need the rags and I wore them that way and they started rubbing against my skin and they abraded the skin and it wouldn't heal and it just kept opened and opened and wound and finally found out that there was a <span class="building">hospital</span> or <span class="building">infirmary</span> and I went there and I got it bandaged, the bandage was crepe paper and the cleaning was with peroxide, they just sloshed it with peroxide and I don't know if they put any ointment on it at all but they wrapped it up in the white crepe and that was it, off you go. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And then I found out that if the wound is bad enough that you might get a day off from work, <span class="building">barracks</span> rest, they let you stay inside and I learned all tricks as much as I could, I mean I kept my eyes opened and my ears opened because otherwise my father said I was not survival material and I was trying to, I wasn't trying to prove him wrong, I was just trying to get by. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And find out as many tricks as I could use to get by. </sentence><sentence id="1323">So one day I did get a <span class="building">barracks</span> rest and one day while I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span>, I see somebody with diarrhea and they shove him a <span class="spatial object">pan</span> and tell him prove it, so he goes in to the <span class="spatial object">pan</span> and fine, you go into the <span class="building">infirmary</span>, stay here. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So again, it was chance, in some cases, people who had diarrhea were killed, were beaten to death, in some cases they got admitted to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, so it was all kinds of inconsistencies. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Who are you running to, when, what time of the day? </sentence><sentence id="1326">Going on a sick leave, it was a murder, I mean there was a guard there who was beating the sick ones and there was, you had maybe five minutes to get in there or something like that and then before you had to get back into formation. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And anyway, I did get diarrhea and I did get into the <span class="building">hospital</span> and surprisingly they had good food for the ones with the diarrhea, I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And I managed to stay in there, like one way or another I managed to stay in there like eight or nine days, which was a fantastic break. </sentence><sentence id="1329">I didn't </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1330"> 04:31 have to work, the wound healed by itself from not being abraded all day and from getting a slightly different food and from being at rest. </sentence><sentence id="1331">And then I got back to the same <span class="building">barracks</span> where I was before and we were all working in all kinds of different units and one unit and this and that and the next day in a different unit and some, what we considered best was working inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> because then we didn't have to march a long march out to the worksite and a long march back to the <span class="building">worksite</span> and we could go to the <span class="building">barracks</span> and get our food, and the  6 the soup at noon in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, which again was folly, because the ones who worked out there were distributed by different people who were not as greedy as the block chief and was more equitably distributed. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So I'm working out in the big worksite where the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> were, but outside the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> and we were shoveling gravel from where the <span class="spatial object">gravel crusher</span> is tossing it and from there it's being loaded, spread out all over the place, so the whole <span class="building">worksite</span> will be covered with it and dust, stone dust all over and this was in maybe August. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I have it written down, but I didn't memorize the date and the white dust is falling all over and the boys are in a good mood, because the job is easy and there were no close supervision. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1334">The Kapo was not nearby, the SS wasn't nearby and they are all talking and by that time I had a very bad reputation that I'll eat anything, that I'll eat breadcrumbs from the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, that I'll eat potato peelings which others throw away and only that I'm just a pig and I went to the <span class="interior space">latrine</span> and when I come back, we all had our soup bowls with us, we always carried the soup bowl and the spoon which was assigned to us, which we kept and they tell me that a civilian was there and gave them a milk soup and would I like it? </sentence><sentence id="1335">I said, why didn't you eat it, they said, well we ate already and we left some for you, so I was kind of leery about it, but I start eating, being like I said a pig and greedy and all out for any bite of food and it doesn't taste right to me. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And I had put away maybe four or five tablespoons of it and it just doesn't taste right and finally one of them opened his mouth, pitch it, throw it out. </sentence><sentence id="1337">It turned out they got the white dust from the <span class="env feature">rocks</span> and they poured water into it and they told me it's a milk soup for , well it's <span class="country">Germany</span>, so it doesn't taste like the <span class="building">home</span> milk soup we had at <span class="building">home</span>, we  7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1338">A: One of those times when my bread got stolen, he gave me some of his, which was a rare thing in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, I mean there were times, not many times I mean, I used to think to myself, I wish I had a father like him, I wish I had a father like him, that's how he was to me, he was kind and he was, he always had the news. </sentence><sentence id="1339">Somehow where he worked, there were civilians and somehow those civilians were not unfriendly and somehow they all read the Nazi paper, which was Voelkischer Beobachter, but even the Voekischer Beobachter, like I told you, you could read between the <span class="dlf">lines</span>, I mean there are, we knew within a day from when the allies landed in <span class="populated place">Normandy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I knew where the front was when I'm working the <span class="building">SS barracks</span> and the <span class="dlf">windows</span> were opened and one of the SS had a map on his <span class="dlf">wall</span>, which he took from the newspaper on which was the <span class="dlf">front line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1341">So I knew that the promised always we shall push them back into the <span class="env feature">ocean</span>, they did not push them back in the <span class="env feature">ocean</span> because the <span class="dlf">red line</span> was in <span class="region">northern France</span> and I knew that maps. </sentence><sentence id="1342">So one way or another, Montsy(ph)Basci, I called him Uncle Montsy(ph) was always a source of news and we knew when, how far they were from <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, how far this or that, it was very slow going, for us it was a hundred times too slow, but it was hope, somehow and the news meant an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="1343">And in the <span class="building">hospital</span> I met a Czech medic who was also very nice and I would say that guy too, had an influence on me for the rest of my days, I mean that guy could laugh and joke in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in the middle of death, like and again that meant something which I didn't grow up with that, there was no joking in my <span class="building">home</span>, in my father's <span class="building">home</span>, there was nothing to be happy about or stuff like and this guy like, I would say, had that influence on me, but I can laugh at things and I can make jokes out of things and comes in a kid and he had dog bites, somebody sent a dog on him and come to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and just happens at that time, I come into the <span class="building">hospital</span> with a swollen eye, because we took shelter in a <span class="interior space">dugout</span> for an SS guard, from the rain, I mean <span class="building">shelter</span> from the rain in an SS guard's <span class="interior space">dugout</span> and the chief, the Lager Fuehrer came by in his rain poncho, what are you doing down there and the whole <span class="spatial object">work unit</span> was down there. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Get out of there this second and he had always with him a whip and he was hitting as we were coming out and I happened to catch it across the eye, so happened to be in the <span class="building">hospital</span> at there, in the evening after work and they said, oh you must have done something bad that you got that whip across your eye and that wasn't too funny, but still, 1 mean he was trying to do whatever to cheer you up somehow and take your mind off the things and so every one of those little things meant, it was out of proportion to what it was in value. </sentence><sentence id="1345">I mean it's value was out of proportion to the one single word which was uttered it meant, just morale, for the morale and for, in a sense you could feel, you could lean on that word or something, it's hard to put it into words, hard to really describe it, but I think I'm coming close.,..... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1378">Q: But you heard about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1380">A: No, not until I was, years after the war I heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="1381">They got drunk and he and another SS or two other SS men and a work detail was returning from work and they just pulled out their pistols and started shooting into them and they were all written up as having died in the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1382">But this one was a, <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> work was in his blood, I mean he was a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> guard from the year maybe and, this too I only found out when I read his write up or biography, which I obtained from, of all places, from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, from that <span class="spatial object">archives</span> which they have there and that was maybe in "37 already was a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> guard. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And then he was at one place and another place and as he moved, each time he got higher and he knew the ways how to handle the stuff and he was tough on the guards and 10 times as tough on the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1384">So by the time he got to Ebensee(ph) he was the Lager commandant or Lager Fuehrer as they called him and he was maybe a captain, Haupt Sturm Fuehrer, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And as far as brutality, the brutality was the beaters, the prisoners themselves, who were there to do the beating and again there was one incident which, once I was in a fairly decent work detail, I mean, everything was chance and luck and if you tried to get into that again, sometimes you get pulled out of it and what --?, </sentence><sentence id="1386">so this work detail was working near the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, near the <span class="building">Krema</span> [<span class="building">crematorium</span>] on the other side of the <span class="dlf">wire fence</span> and <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span> had it's own <span class="populated place">Krema</span> after a while and we were digging huge <span class="dlf">pits</span> 04:45 for storing potatoes and beets for the winter and the SS who was in charge was probably a farmer in civilian and he was not so young, he may have been, I don't know, in the 40's and he was not particularly mean. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And the couple who was in charge of the work detail was a German, a redhead, freckled, with a horribly low number. </sentence><sentence id="1388">You knew that he was there an extremely long time, like I had a number 68,308 and the next 500 Jews came into <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span>,  9 they were already 70 thousanders. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Two weeks later there was another <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, they were already 72,000. </sentence><sentence id="1390">In October came the Poles from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, who were captured during the Polish uprising, or crushed out, when it was crushed, they already had number 93,000 or 98,000. </sentence><sentence id="1391">So when somebody has a number with four digits, he was there a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Then they started bringing the potatoes for those <span class="dlf">pits</span> and we were pouring them in and as we put, we store one here or one there and there all potatoes, they bring them in to the <span class="building">barracks</span> in the evening after work and sort of snuggle to the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, everybody was crowding around the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> and put them on the top and bake them or burn them or whatever, so they wouldn't be raw. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And one evening, this must have been in late November, it was dark already and we are coming back from work and at the <span class="dlf">gates</span> we are counted and the SS is relieved and the <span class="dlf">gate</span> is being opened and the SS around are watching that everybody goes in and ahead of us is standing another work detail and they are being frisked one by one by one, by a row of maybe four or five SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1394">They are just going through everybody for anything, I mean bringing in an empty paper bag was sabotage and punishable be a good beating, plenty beating and when we saw what's coming, we started reaching in for our potatoes, into the pockets and hiding them and where will we put them, but we were in the flood lens and the SS who were searching the ones in front of us said, oh, they are tossing away the potatoes already, don't even bother searching them, in they go as soon as they cross the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, 10 for everybody, 10 whips or 10 lashes, including the <span class="building">Kapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1395">So as soon as we get in, the <span class="spatial object">beaters</span> grab us and they have there these huge <span class="spatial object">barrels</span>, just for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="1396">They grab you, toss you onto the <span class="spatial object">barrel</span> with the face down and beat on the rear with sticks and rubber hoses. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And I was screaming because he wasn't hitting my rear, he was hitting my coccyx and when we all got our beatings, the couple was still standing by and he says, if you want to come by to my <span class="building">barracks</span> after supper, we'll just have a little get together. </sentence><sentence id="1398">So, and this other guy who was in my <span class="building">work unit</span>, from my own <span class="building">barracks</span>, a Jewish guy, a tall one, says to me, why were you yelling? </sentence><sentence id="1399">Said because he was hitting in my bone instead of my tail. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Well did it do you any good to yell, said why yell? </sentence><sentence id="1401">So about five of us Jewish kids or 10 from that unit, after supper, we went to his <span class="building">barracks</span> and it was Kapos only in that <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And he told them to let us in and that was a completely different class, I mean the <span class="dlf">walls</span> were painted, I mean, many <span class="building">barracks</span> had whitewashed <span class="dlf">walls</span>, but this one was homey looking. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And they had all kinds of things and we were standing around the <span class="spatial object">fireplace</span>, I mean the <span class="spatial object">stove</span>, it was just the camaraderie on part of this Kapo, what I would call the fellowship of the beaten ones. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Again he was unique, he was remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="1405">And he had a, it was a pink triangle, which was, the Germans trusted criminals and German criminals and even pink triangles over any other foreigners and if you were German, you were 10 foot higher than a Polish prisoner or a French prisoner and you could be trusted to be assigned as a Kapo or a block chief or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And on one of those mornings when we were marching out, we were going by the <span class="dlf">perimeter fence</span> and on it was a person hanging, dead. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Either tossed on it, or jumped on it. </sentence><sentence id="1408">We never knew, when somebody was dead, if somebody killed him, or if he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1409">There was a man in my <span class="spatial object">transport</span> of 500 in <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, from <span class="country">Hungary</span> proper. </sentence><sentence id="1410">In other words, some of us were from <span class="populated place">Carpathia</span>, some were from <span class="populated place">hungary</span>, some were from <span class="populated place">Transylvania</span> and as things got, they got mixed, sort of and this guy, I don't know what he was, he may have been an attorney and he was very intellectual and he looked down on everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I mean a prisoner, but everybody to him was dirt compared to him and then he  0 was king, King Shit, in plain English. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And when we got to <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span>, within one day we have, one evening we come back from work and there is the head count, Appell as they called it and one is missing and whenever one was missing, there was circus, everybody had to stand, remain standing, all formation and it was, it should have been so easy to find who was missing because every <span class="building">barracks</span> had a book on which the clerk wrote how many hour in the <span class="building">barracks</span>, you know, and the SS counted them already, how many were and checked off that yeah, there were so many, so one of them didn't count properly and he should have known which was. </sentence><sentence id="1413">So anyway, a recounting again, this time for sure and checking the numbers and they found which <span class="building">barracks</span> is one shy, so beaters, Kapos, everybody, go into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, into the <span class="region">camp area</span>, this was a, the head count was in a <span class="dlf">square</span>, like a <span class="dlf">plaza</span>, which was open and the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was, I mean it was to one side of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, so into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, find them. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And they go through the <span class="building">barracks</span>, first of all go to the <span class="building">barracks</span> where he is supposed to be and he's not there, so go all over the place, maybe he's hiding in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, hiding here, hiding there, we'll beat all over with the sticks, look for, so finally they come back laughing. </sentence><sentence id="1415">The Jew was hanging on the <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So he says, next time one of you Jews decides to kill himself, let us know in advance so we won't have to do all this searching and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1417">So for long months after that, I always said to myself, that man was a smart man, he was the only one with brains among us that he killed himself on the first week, before he went through so much suffering. </sentence><sentence id="1418">But, and that's how it entered in the book, in the register that he was, he committed suicide or something like that, they had funny words for everything, but then I started thinking about it and it occurred to me that this guy 04:55 was arrogant and it's not impossible that he might have incited a block chief or a Kapo or somebody who just strangled him on the spot and hanged him. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So you never know, I mean the dead ones don't talk and the ones who killed them wouldn't' talk, so, and with this guy I'll get to, I'll tell you my philosophy and the suffering which got me through it, because when we carried those pre-fab sections, it was horrible, real back-breaking work, I thought, it'll kill me and I couldn't believe that I survived it and I didn't want to die the next day, because I said if I survived that, I don't want to die now and then it was again some very hard work and somehow managed to survive and then just didn't want to kill myself, but it would have been a way out, so it just, one hardship after another hardship, sort of just kept me going. </sentence><sentence id="1420">If you survived that, you're not going to kill yourself now, I mean this is very bad, but not quite as bad as that was.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1468">Q: ... kind of an interesting story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1470">A: I had an accident on the <span class="dlf">work site</span> on February 28. </sentence><sentence id="1471">It was one of those days when I felt very depressed and disgusted and I was pushing one of these <span class="spatial object">lorries</span> on the <span class="dlf">work site</span> and the  1 <span class="spatial object">locomotive</span> came up behind, pushing another <span class="spatial object">lorry</span> and the fellows were yelling at me to jump, get out from there and I didn't realize they were yelling at me and they were not, apparently make too much effort to yell at me or get me out of there, I got caught between the two <span class="spatial object">lorries</span> and broke my wrist. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And immediately I was taken off the <span class="dlf">work site</span>, taken into the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, report to SS, count one off from this work detail, they'll be coming in one short because he's coming in now and went to the, my clerk, block clerk, <span class="building">barracks</span> clerk, who was a Pole who hated my guts because I always went to <span class="building">hospital</span> and he hated that. </sentence><sentence id="1473">He hated me for trying to get out of bad work details, so anyway, he walks me to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and he says, oh now you have it made, he says, the was will be over pretty soon and you can stay there until the end and this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1474">So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made, but what was the thing was I was in the <span class="building">Jewish barracks</span>, the only place which was segregated inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was the <span class="building">hospital</span>, they had one <span class="building">barracks</span> for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And I showed you the ID badge, which I had here when I went into the <span class="building">hospital</span>, by end of April I could pull it up here without, I mean if I didn't adjust it. </sentence><sentence id="1476">And I was just losing weight something awful. </sentence><sentence id="1477">You could see it that my bones were sticking out, my ribs were sticking out and I saw people around me who looked like, I've never seen humans look that way. </sentence><sentence id="1478">I mean their <span class="spatial object">chests</span> look like they are sticking out like this, but it wasn't their <span class="spatial object">chests</span> were sticking out, it was their abdomens were completely sunk in and the pelvic bones were sticking out and the pelvic bones were sticking out in the front, on the side and the back and it was just frightful sight, I mean, I could figure that you could almost time yourself how soon you will be in that stage and they just used to grab them and toss them to the <span class="dlf">corner</span> where there were the dead bodies and every day there was <span class="spatial object">pile</span> there, in every <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And it was just, the soup was just a broth and so much of it, maybe half liter, which is nothing and the bread was inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span> they used to get one-third of a bread and eventually they got cut down to one-quarter. </sentence><sentence id="1480">In the <span class="building">hospital</span> they used to give us like less than one-eighth and after awhile it wasn't bread any more. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Instead of flour, they put into it sawdust, instead of flour there was like a potato and it taste like a and it was nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1494">Q: . </sentence><sentence id="1495"> 2 Tape #5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1498">A: I was telling about the first American soldier whom we saw, it was on May eighth", somewhere early afternoon and he was walking toward the <span class="building">Krema</span>, in front of the <span class="building">hospital</span> and as many of us as we could, we jumped to the <span class="dlf">window</span> to get a glimpse of him and he was just surrounded be prisoners who I suppose were, I don't know what you want to call them, ranking guys or guys from the resistance, or within the organization within or something like that and like three or four of them are talking to him at the same time, everybody was trying to talk to him, tell him how horrible the place was and everything and he was just going silently and walking towards and you asked me about foreign news, we had access to a Swiss magazine" and in that Swiss magazine we could see things and if it was blacked out, we were able to wipe the black off and that was where I first saw American soldiers, what they looked like, I never seen one before, pictures of them or, saw pictures of them there. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And this guy looked just like any one of those from the pictures, he had a helmet on and the short field jacket and he was alive and we just stared and nobody said a word, nobody screamed, nobody shouted, nobody cheered or waved, anything, we just were, by that time we were just numb, emotionally worn out and physically just like also very close to the end, also just 05:03 about worn out. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And I mean I can see him right in front of my eyes, the guy just walking in. </sentence><sentence id="1501">I don't remember if he was an enlisted man or an officer, but I mean, just walked calmly and all, only one, one that managed to get from, there were more of them probably, at the upper part and where they came in, they might have to get one to come to look at the <span class="building">Krema</span> and the dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And it took two days before the Americans got organized enough to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="1503">So slow we thought it's forever. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And then, we were begging them for food and of course they didn't, were not carrying food with them when they came into the <span class="populated place">camp</span> to look at the thing, to see the sights. </sentence><sentence id="1505">And it was like almost you might say a horrible anti-climax, a horrible let down, I mean we expected that as soon as the <span class="dlf">gates</span> opened, we would all be free and we would be getting food and it would be just wonderful and it was nothing of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="1506">And one thing I wanted was to get out of the <span class="building">hospital</span> as soon as I could because even after the Americans came in, I just hated those people with whom I was locked up there, it was like a, I was imprisoned with them, I was a captive audience to their stupid, endless bullshit, their endless yakking about empty things, about nothing and I just, on and on and on and on and I wanted to be away from them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1525">A: The sick ones with whom I was in the same <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1526">I was, we had four prisoners in one <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, lying head to foot and there was nothing to do all day, so nothing else, talk about food and talking about stupid things at <span class="building">home</span> and I wanted out of there and Americans finally processed us, the <span class="interior space">hospital unit</span> on eighth of May, two days after the liberation, that's when they came in, that's when they swarmed into the <span class="building">hospital compound</span>, in came the photographers and in came the <span class="interior space">hospital units</span>, which later I found out was called a  4 Americans or the prisoner committee managed to talk the cooks into staying on and cooking food for the rest of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1527">They felt the war is over and they don't have to work any more and there is no reason why, everybody's free and why they shouldn't be free. </sentence><sentence id="1528">So anyway, the food was sloshing from these <span class="spatial object">containers</span> and I got my bowl under it and I was collecting it and then I ate that soup and it was, to me it was at least something I could eat. </sentence><sentence id="1529">There was only one catch, the same <span class="spatial object">cart</span> on which they were hauling the food was used the day before for hauling the dead bodies and some of the dead bodies were, maybe had, feces were coming out of them, nobody washed the <span class="spatial object">cart</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1530">In other words, what I was getting was maybe excrement from dead bodies and I got the shits and it wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="1531">I was free and I was closer to death than ever before. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And I got as far as <span class="populated place">Prague</span> and I still had the diarrhea and even the Czechs couldn't cure it, nobody could cure it, it took a long time, until a friend of the family got me some cocoa and that stopped it. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So, there's another one to whom I owe quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="1534">He's still alive today, he's in <span class="country">Canada</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1549">Q: Off the <span class="dlf">top</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1551">A: That's one of the photos, which the American Signal Corp. photographers took in <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span> when they came into the <span class="building">Jewish Hospital barracks</span> and I happen to be on this one, the second one from the right. </sentence><sentence id="1552">As you can see, some of us had, were skinnier than I and my knees were sticking out, my ribs are visible and both my legs and my arms are rather skinny. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And I turned to the side, facing to the right, for what I would call positive identification, because I have a scar from an operation over the left ear and I always wanted to show that and for let's say someday it will be seen somewhere and I could definitely be sure that it's, prove it that that's me, that is I. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1557">Q: Physically you were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1559">A: And my memory is not infallible, I can't tell you exactly when this picture was taken, it may have been taken in 1941 or "42. </sentence><sentence id="1560">On the left side is my brother, the middle is my mother and the right side am I, I am and I can tell you for sure that at this point I was already in the <span class="building">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> because each <span class="building">school</span> had a cap, sort of like a uniform cap and my brother is wearing the one from the <span class="building">secondary school</span> and I already am not wearing the one from the <span class="building">Hungarian Gymnasium</span> and there was not yet <span class="building">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> cap so it's somewhere in between, it's definitely 1941 or later. </sentence><sentence id="1561">This is after I recovered, after the war, I believe in, late in "46. </sentence><sentence id="1562">It took me awhile before my hair started to grow again, it was probably one of the reasons, I mean vitamin deficiency, it took my body a good number of months to get back to, let's say, in condition or anything, or normal and to put on some weight. </sentence><sentence id="1563">On the Ebensee photo, I weigh about 30 kilograms, on this one I suppose it's around 60, 65 kilograms. </sentence><sentence id="1564">Many, many decades after <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span>, like around 1978, when I lived in the <span class="region">Washington area</span>, I found out that the <span class="building">Ebensee</span>, the Mauthausen register of prisoners is in the  5 <span class="building">national archives</span> and I went to look at it and it's in numerical order, so I'd no problem finding my entry on it, we all know our prisoner numbers, mine happened to be 68,308 and when I came upon it, it was just kind of earth shaking or whatever, I don't know, very upsetting and it was like, later on I got a copy of a page for a friend on which his name was and he says to me that it was like a page out of <span class="region">hell</span> and I think those words are about as apt as you can find and the ones who perished or were killed are crossed out with a <span class="dlf">line</span>, with red ink and those who died after a certain date are no longer crossed out because the book was kept only up to perhaps the last week in April, 1945, so anybody died the last week of April or the beginning of May, it seems that he's still alive, but he isn't. </sentence><sentence id="1565">Because they didn't get the chance to cross out his name and this one is my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1566">As I found out, the day after the liberation, from another prisoner who happened to be in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> where he was, he was sent to a <span class="populated place">sub camp</span> called <span class="populated place">Gusen</span>, which was near <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> and as you see, most of these are youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="1567">You can see there his date of birth is entered as 1930 or actually it was 1931.You can see there are dates are also young ones there, like 1929, 1930 and they probably were also lying about their ages so they might have been even younger than that. </sentence><sentence id="1568">And again, these names of <span class="populated place">camps</span>, same way we didn't know about <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, we never heard about <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>, we never heard about <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span>, I never knew about <span class="populated place">Gusen</span> and the way this guy pronounced it, I thought it was <span class="populated place">Kuszen</span> or something like that and many years later I saw it in print and it's <span class="populated place">Gusen</span> and there is the date on which he died and, but I managed to obtain that date about a year, or two years after the war when I came to this <span class="country">country</span>, somebody told me about an international refugee organization and they gave me the date then, which again, I did not know until then. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I had no idea if he's still alive somewhere or not. </sentence><sentence id="1570">These are my maternal grandparents, who were so dear to me and who were so nice to me and who's <span class="building">home</span> was like a refuge to me, many a times. </sentence><sentence id="1571">And with whom I could talk even more at ease or more closely that with my own parents. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Fannie Moskowitz and Samuel Moskowitz, David Samuel Moskowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1573">This is the <span class="building">prison</span> bracelet which I have from <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> and <span class="populated place">Ebensee</span> and bears my number, 68,308 and as I explained, when I went into the <span class="building">hospital</span>, I could wear it on my wrist and then as I lost weight, I could bring it up all the way to my, virtually upper arm, I mean to the top of my forearm. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And the <span class="dlf">wire</span> on it is from a <span class="dlf">blasting wire</span> from the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span>, the <span class="dlf">tunnels</span> project. </sentence><sentence id="1575">Conclusion of interview. </sentence><sentence id="1576">
