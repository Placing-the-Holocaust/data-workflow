<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Can you describe what sort of anti-Semitism he noticed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Well -- well, what I do remember, his telling me about the complaint that too many Jews were trying to get out of serving in the army. </sentence><sentence id="46">So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="47">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="48"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 German army. </sentence><sentence id="49">When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented in the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s. </sentence><sentence id="50">But -- so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews. </sentence><sentence id="51">I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the <span class="dlf">transportation system</span>, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main <span class="spatial object">vehicle transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">So, I remember these things, I'm sure, not when I was -- before going to <span class="building">primary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">But I had always someone, a -- a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle's <span class="building">house</span>, who had a child my age. </sentence><sentence id="54">So this is how I lived in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, but I do not recall having any non- Jewish German friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: What sort of <span class="building">school</span> did you attend? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: What sort of <span class="building">elementary school</span> did you attend? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, I went to a <span class="building">parochial school</span>, of which -- of the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">We lived there, nearby, walking distance, and I do remember being attacked sometimes by other kids, ger -- who didn't like Jewish kids, and you had to fight. </sentence><sentence id="74">And so I went to this <span class="building">school</span>, which was not a very good <span class="building">school</span>; we had, I would say, very poor teachers. </sentence><sentence id="75">And I was kind of a rebellious, problematic child. </sentence><sentence id="76">I would talk back to the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="77">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="78"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 teachers sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="79">And at one point, a teacher called me a donkey. </sentence><sentence id="80">And so I said, well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey. </sentence><sentence id="81">And the teacher was so upset. </sentence><sentence id="82">And finally my parents bribed me to apologize, even though I -- they agreed I -- it was justified for me to talk back. </sentence><sentence id="83">But as soon as -- after four years, I went to <span class="building">high school</span>, <span class="building">gymnasium</span> as in -- they call it in German. </sentence><sentence id="84">And in the middle of that year, that was in 1933, the government decided that no Jewish child should be allowed to go to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, and so I was notified that I could not continue, in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Let me step back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="100">Before "33, how aware of you what -- were you of the political unrest that was going on in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>? </sentence><sentence id="101">Did you witness any political rallies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Well, strange is, I do remember being very interested in what was going on, and reading the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="106">Now, of course, I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="107">So certainly I have very vivid memories of 1932 and 1933. </sentence><sentence id="108">But I do not recall ever feeling frightened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: When the results of the plebiscite were announced in "32, and they announced that Hitler had won, what was the immediate reaction in your family? </sentence><sentence id="114">Did people take it seriously? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="117">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="118">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="119"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="120"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton " May 27, 2010 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the <span class="building">company</span> for which he w -- he had to give up his business because of the depression. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was based in -- a lot on export of shaving brushes to other <span class="country">European countries</span>, and he had traveled a great deal to different <span class="country">countries</span>, and as a result I became a stamp collector. </sentence><sentence id="123">But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn't enough, so he worked for a <span class="building">company</span> selling their c -- shaving brushes. </sentence><sentence id="124">And he lost the job. </sentence><sentence id="125">And I remember in 19 -- you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn't think it was a catastrophe. </sentence><sentence id="126">It wouldn't last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it. </sentence><sentence id="127">And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to announce that he was making men's suits to -- for measure. </sentence><sentence id="128">He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made clothing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn't have the mass production. </sentence><sentence id="129">And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of <span class="building">school</span> or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into <span class="spatial object">mailboxes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">My first job. </sentence><sentence id="131">So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, in 1934 -"35, he effectively ceased having an income. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Now, did you witness any of the <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> rallies in the first year? </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1351">There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being taken prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So I decided I would make myself an officer. </sentence><sentence id="1353">That was a risky thing to do, to impersonate an officer in the army. </sentence><sentence id="1354">But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir -- in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the <span class="dlf">front lines</span>. </sentence><sentence

that this might take, we put up the general in the <span class="building">hotel</span>, and my job, I was in the same <span class="interior space">room</span> with him, was to take him for walks, see

problems with this man, and I don't know what's going to happen, but it doesn't look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower's <span class="building">headquarters</span> are concerned over the fact that you took this general in <span class="region">Third Army territory</span> and brought him to <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, when according to army rules, which you didn't

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1475">A: Nothing, it wasn't used. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Apparently, there was enough fear among the upper level staff that Patton would get furious if someone that was captured in his <span class="region">area</span> was not -- did not -- he did not have the opportunity to handle the whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And for that reason, rather than get into another controversy between Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower -- and there had been many controversies between them, I mean, they -- Patton was very egocentric -- the decision was made to return the captain to where we had taken him prisoner and then to notify the French, the free French, who had been asked to move into Treya(ph) as the Third Army was advancing, to come up and arrest him. </sentence><sentence id="1478">So my job, they says -- an-an -- and -- and -- and they said, we decided you should do the job. </sentence><sentence id="1479">So here was my -- I-I was given another driver, and it was my job to find the place where I had taken him prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
