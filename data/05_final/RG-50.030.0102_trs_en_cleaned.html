Like if I would be buried alive. </sentence><sentence id="395">They looked and they looked and they looked, and they walked on me. </sentence><sentence id="396">They never found me. </sentence><sentence id="397">So anyway, my lawyer was not a good lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="398">He found that I have not enough reasons to get, uh they call it... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: What else do you remember from those two years? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: These two years were very hard, for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="401">Because my "Aunt"--the woman, Raphaele's aunt--and [her] husband didn't live very good. </sentence><sentence id="402">And I was very naive. </sentence><sentence id="403">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="404">He was an intellectual, and he was sorry that the only child they have was retarded. </sentence><sentence id="405">So they didn't get along so well. </sentence><sentence id="406">And Il used to take the part of her and of him, to make shalom b'bayit [Heb: "peace in the <span class="building">house</span>"; and not always did I succeed. </sentence><sentence id="407">And it was aggravating me, because my parents never spoke a loud word to each other. </sentence><sentence id="408">When they would like discuss, they would go to the other <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="409">My brother and I wasn't, uh, there. </sentence><sentence id="410">And I wasn't used to see people, who live together and loved each other, [who] shouldn't talk for days. [ </sentence><sentence id="411">Who] should eat together, and make like was a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="412">I wasn't used like that. </sentence><sentence id="413">I wasn't brought up like that. " </sentence><sentence id="414">Cause I was brought up in a very warm and loving family my parents had. </sentence><sentence id="415">So it was hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="416">And [ all the time thought, "When my parents come back, I'll appreciate them more. </sentence><sentence id="417">And if my brother comes alive, I'll never get married. </sentence><sentence id="418">Never. </sentence><sentence id="419">Take care of him all my life, as long as I live." </sentence><sentence id="420">But it didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="421">It didn't happen, so I can't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="422">And it's still... when people are with their children, are complaining, it hurts me. </sentence><sentence id="423">Because, thank God, they have normal children and parents. </sentence><sentence id="424">They have old mothers, old fathers. </sentence><sentence id="425">My mother was 43 and my father 41 when they died. </sentence><sentence id="426">So it's very young. </sentence><sentence id="427">And my brother was 17 or 18. </sentence><sentence id="428">He had nothing from life. </sentence><sentence id="429">So it's very painful. </sentence><sentence id="430">And sometimes, you'll remember...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="958">A: The problem was that I lived day-to-day. </sentence><sentence id="959">Because sometimes the man called me, wanted to know my real name. </sentence><sentence id="960">But I was not stupid. </sentence><sentence id="961">I told him that's my name. </sentence><sentence id="962">But one time, I had a very big problem. </sentence><sentence id="963">And my "Aunt" that kept me was very angry. </sentence><sentence id="964">I went to a girlfriend to play. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="965">And I shouldn't have gone; because in the front of the <span class="building">house</span> of that girlfriend was a big <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and they had just picked up Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="966">And that boy who was sitting in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> knew me. </sentence><sentence id="967">He wanted to go with me to my "Aunt" Paulette--her name. </sentence><sentence id="968">And "Aunt" Paulette didn't want to accept. </sentence><sentence id="969">When he saw me, he told the Germans, "She is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="970">Put her in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with me." </sentence><sentence id="971">But when the German went down, I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="972">I was very fast. </sentence><sentence id="973">I was gone; but for three days, I was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="974">Like shock. </sentence><sentence id="975">I was so nervous. </sentence><sentence id="976">I was so afraid. </sentence><sentence id="977">How a person can.... "If 1 am in a problem, I want you to be." </sentence><sentence id="978">He shouldn't have done that. </sentence><sentence id="979">And he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="980">But he told the German; and I was maybe not far away, and that's what happened. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="981">I disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="982">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="983">I had the courage to stand up in a second; because he just had to go down from the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and he showed . </sentence><sentence id="984">And they looked and they looked in all  1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: The man who kept the...who kept the identities cards. </sentence><sentence id="986">The identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="987">He called me to his <span class="building">house</span>; and he told me, "Give me your card. </sentence><sentence id="988">I'll give it back to you next week, "cause I have to change the age, or the time or something." </sentence><sentence id="989">And I had a feeling that I shouldn't give it. </sentence><sentence id="990">And I had not discussed it with my "Aunt," but I had a feeling not to give him. </sentence><sentence id="991">And I say, "No, she'll give you next week." </sentence><sentence id="992">And next morning, at six in the morning, he was killed with the papers from 25 or 40 people that he had. </sentence><sentence id="993">And all these people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="994">And I thank God.... Must have been a will from God that, uh, that I wasn't taken; because he didn't have my papers. </sentence><sentence id="995">If he would have my papers, it would be the same as my papers. </sentence><sentence id="996">So that's all. </sentence><sentence id="997">And, uh, I had a lot of little events; events that I would feel bad if...like Germans would go in the front of the <span class="building">house</span>, and go and look for something or what. </sentence><sentence id="998">So instinctively, I thought it's for me. </sentence><sentence id="999">I got nervous that they're looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="1000">But I think when you are in the situation, you are stronger and braver. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I could pay attention myself you see. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I knew when to let go, because like when he ...they looked for me when I was like buried. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I knew I have to breathe my nose, my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I have to keep up "til they come to save me. </sentence><sentence id="1005">When they came, they were happy that I was breathing; because it was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="1006">So, problem is that uh the closest from my aunt's, my uncle's--twenty-four people the closest--were taken all to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So sometimes I say, if people complain, people should be happy. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It is a too narrow <span class="dlf">road</span>, people set in <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, came from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But there is no one day that I forget my parents or Raphaele. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Because she...really did a lot for me. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And if not, I wouldn't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="1012">So that's the reason I always want her to feel good, to buy something special for her, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1013">That's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
