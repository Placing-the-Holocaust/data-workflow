<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: The problem was that I lived day-to-day. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Because sometimes the man called me, wanted to know my real name. </sentence><sentence id="1068">But I was not stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1069">I told him that's my name. </sentence><sentence id="1070">But one time, I had a very big problem. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And my "Aunt" that kept me was very angry. </sentence><sentence id="1072">I went to a girlfriend to play. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And I shouldn't have gone; because in the front of the <span class="building">house</span> of that girlfriend was a big <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and they had just picked up Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1074">And that boy who was sitting in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> knew me. </sentence><sentence id="1075">He wanted to go with me to my "Aunt" Paulette--her name. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And "Aunt" Paulette didn't want to accept. </sentence><sentence id="1077">When he saw me, he told the Germans, "She is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Put her in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with me." </sentence><sentence id="1079">But when the German went down, I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I was very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I was gone; but for three days, I was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Like shock. </sentence><sentence id="1083">I was so nervous. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I was so afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1085">How a person can.... "If 1 am in a problem, I want you to be." </sentence><sentence id="1086">He shouldn't have done that. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="1088">But he told the German; and I was maybe not far away, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1091">I had the courage to stand up in a second; because he just had to go down from the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and he showed . </sentence><sentence id="1092">And they looked and they looked in all the <span class="building">houses</span>; but I put a scarf over my head, and he didn't look at my face. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And when he came in, he didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="1094">He didn't know who | am. " </sentence><sentence id="1095">I was looking for that girl, but..." You understand. </sentence><sentence id="1096">So it was very hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1128">Q: Did you have other escapes like this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1130">A: I had a few escapes that I told you. </sentence><sentence id="1131">That he took my papers at night. </sentence><sentence id="1132">He said.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Which he? </sentence><sentence id="1137"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: The man who kept the...who kept the identities cards. </sentence><sentence id="1141">The identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="1142">He called me to his <span class="building">house</span>; and he told me, "Give me your card. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I'll give it back to you next week, "cause I have to change the age, or the time or something." </sentence><sentence id="1144">And I had a feeling that I shouldn't give it. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I had not discussed it with my "Aunt," but I had a feeling not to give him. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And I say, "No, she'll give you next week." </sentence><sentence id="1147">And next morning, at six in the morning, he was killed with the papers from 25 or 40 people that he had. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And all these people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And I thank God.... Must have been a will from God that, uh, that I wasn't taken; because he didn't have my papers. </sentence><sentence id="1150">If he would have my papers, it would be the same as my papers. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And, uh, I had a lot of little events; events that I would feel bad if...like Germans would go in the front of the <span class="building">house</span>, and go and look for something or what. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So instinctively, I thought it's for me. </sentence><sentence id="1154">I got nervous that they're looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="1155">But I think when you are in the situation, you are stronger and braver. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I could pay attention myself you see. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I knew when to let go, because like when he ...they looked for me when I was like buried. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I knew I have to breathe my nose, my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I have to keep up "til they come to save me. </sentence><sentence id="1160">When they came, they were happy that I was breathing; because it was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="1161">So, problem is that uh the closest from my aunt's, my uncle's--twenty-four people the closest--were taken all to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So sometimes I say, if people complain, people should be happy. </sentence><sentence id="1163">It is a too narrow <span class="dlf">road</span>, people set in <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, came from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1164">But there is no one day that I forget my parents or Raphaele. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Because she...really did a lot for me. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And if not, I wouldn't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So that's the reason I always want her to feel good, to buy something special for her, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1168">That's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
