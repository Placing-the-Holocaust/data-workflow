<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in translation or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Well, you could get everything you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="6">I read mostly Polish translations of French, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original. </sentence><sentence id="7">In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized. </sentence><sentence id="8">Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he was subject to the general mobilization. </sentence><sentence id="9">He reported to his regiment and was lucky that he didn't become a POW. </sentence><sentence id="10">He was able to escape capture as a POW and return <span class="building">home</span> six weeks after he left. </sentence><sentence id="11">Of course, we didn't know what had happened to him throughout this period. </sentence><sentence id="12">Subsequently, he had become a very active member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, and our <span class="building">home</span> became the contact place for couriers from <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">Polish ladies, as well as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, came. </sentence><sentence id="14">Mordecai Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, who perished in 1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="15">He stayed in a furnished <span class="building">room establishment</span> in our <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> during a mission to <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, having traveled on Polish papers from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> via <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and <span class="populated place">Czestochowa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">He didn't look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish papers. </sentence><sentence id="17">While in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I didn't know who was in the leadership of the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> Ghetto uprising. </sentence><sentence id="18">Even those rounded up from the ruins of the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, who came to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> via <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> in the early summer of 1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page, that I found out about his role. </sentence><sentence id="20">There were other people from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> who came to our <span class="building">house</span> who were involved in the first armed action in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span> in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them. </sentence><sentence id="21">My brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28" of April 1942 and executed. </sentence><sentence id="22">I was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="23">My entire family was put under house arrest and I had to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="24">By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the neck. </sentence><sentence id="25">I was taken to <span class="building">headquarters</span> of the <span class="building">security service</span> and put into a large <span class="building">shed</span> that was full of Jews from our <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> who had been there since the early morning hours. </sentence><sentence id="26">We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> past midnight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: What went on between "39 and "42? </sentence><sentence id="50">What were you doing? </sentence><sentence id="51">Were you still working or ---? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="57">Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60, had to work at least one day on assigned <span class="building">places of work</span> that the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, and later on the ghetto community government, administered. </sentence><sentence id="58">They had to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various <span class="dlf">posts</span> that the Germans had designated; <span class="building">military posts</span>, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of 3  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection work -- unloading, loading, digging <span class="dlf">ditches</span>, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="59">There was hardly any kind of work that we weren't assigned to do. </sentence><sentence id="60">Being the youngest, I took the place of my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost two or three days a week. </sentence><sentence id="61">I didn't mind, I'd rather do it than have my father, who was in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="62">My oldest brother had to help my father so I took his place as well. </sentence><sentence id="63">In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all able-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> on the <span class="dlf">German-Soviet border</span> in the district of <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> to dig anti-tank fortifications. </sentence><sentence id="64">I was the only one in the family who was caught in the <span class="spatial object">net</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">It turned out that if you didn't report, you simply didn't go; they didn't come after you. </sentence><sentence id="66">But if you did report, you were trapped. </sentence><sentence id="67">Several hundred of us left <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, perhaps four or five hundred men. </sentence><sentence id="68">Altogether there were thousands of young Jewish men from various parts of the <span class="country">country</span> congregated in several <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span> stretched along a section of <span class="region">frontier land</span> that ran between two <span class="env feature">rivers</span>, the <span class="env feature">Bug</span> and the <span class="env feature">San</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">Our <span class="populated place">camp</span> was in <span class="populated place">Cieszanow</span>, where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of <span class="dlf">frontier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="70">That was my introduction to forced labor under SS rule. </sentence><sentence id="71">We left dead inmates at the <span class="building">work site</span> every day. </sentence><sentence id="72">They were simply shot at random and buried in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and covered up with moss, so that one couldn't even find their <span class="dlf">graves</span>, for there were no markers left. </sentence><sentence id="73">This went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out of <span class="populated place">Cieszanow</span> and taken to <span class="populated place">Belzec</span>, from where, by <span class="dlf">rail</span>, we were transported to <span class="populated place">Krasnik</span>, in the District of <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">We spent the whole night in a <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> where the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>'s <span class="building">council</span> was located. </sentence><sentence id="75">I will never forget the kindness of the <span class="populated place">town</span>'s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink. </sentence><sentence id="76">In the afternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Annapol</span> and handed over to a <span class="building">German private firm</span> to build <span class="dlf">highways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were not under any military supervision, but just worked as civilians. </sentence><sentence id="78">We discovered soon that if you go away and don't come back, you're not missed, Several of us decided to start on our way <span class="building">home</span> the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="79">We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to get a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip. </sentence><sentence id="80">We marched 16 kilometers that morning and crossed a guarded <span class="dlf">bridge</span> that spanned the <span class="env feature">Vistula River</span>, and within two hours were in the next <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">We spent the rest of that day going from small <span class="populated place">town</span> to <span class="populated place">town</span>, riding in <span class="spatial object">horse-drawn carts</span> belonging to Jews engaged in either transporting people or goods. </sentence><sentence id="82">After darkness, we found ourselves as "passengers" on such a <span class="spatial object">cart</span>, sharing the <span class="interior space">space</span> with a load of grain that the owner smuggled into the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, traveling through <span class="env feature">forests</span> all night. </sentence><sentence id="83">Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting on "contraband". </sentence><sentence id="84">Had we been stopped, it would have meant the end of us all. </sentence><sentence id="85">We arrived in <span class="populated place">Radom</span> the next morning after an absence of two and a half months. </sentence><sentence id="86">That was my introduction to <span class="populated place">camp</span> life, and in a way it helped me later on. </sentence><sentence id="87">When I arrived at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what awaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> was uniquely evil. </sentence><sentence id="88">In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can state without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was <span class="region">Nazi-occupied Europe</span>, there was no place that could match the hell of <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> in it's first year of existence. </sentence><sentence id="89">We walked the three kilometers from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> on 4  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection May 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Within one month most of them were dead. </sentence><sentence id="91">By the end of about two months, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the <span class="populated place">camp</span> -- there were fifteen of us. </sentence><sentence id="92">Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for doing so. </sentence><sentence id="93">In early 1942 I came down with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="94">There were many typhus cases in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even without any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can't eat anyway in a state of very high fever. </sentence><sentence id="96">I had developed some complications and hemorrhaged all night. </sentence><sentence id="97">We lived in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> under strict curfew conditions and had no access to <span class="building">doctors</span> or <span class="building">drugstores</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">My brother risked his life to go outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to an <span class="building">apothecary</span> in order to get some medication, which turned out to be the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me. </sentence><sentence id="99">The doctor who attended me was sick and he didn't know the seriousness of the problem. </sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, together with one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found one. </sentence><sentence id="101">He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in <span class="populated place">town</span> that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the hemorrhaging. </sentence><sentence id="102">He plainly said, "There's nothing I can do, if you have some cognac, give it to him." </sentence><sentence id="103">He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I remember the stupidity of his suggestion. </sentence><sentence id="104">This was a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> in 1942 and he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="105">In the morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to find a donor who had my blood type. </sentence><sentence id="106">I was supposed to be taken to the <span class="building">hospital</span> for the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn't possibly survive the trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely low. </sentence><sentence id="107">Instead, the <span class="building">ghetto hospital</span> sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers, including my brother Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="108">I remember the technician telling the surgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine. </sentence><sentence id="109">Nevertheless the surgeon decided to use my brother's blood for there was no time to lose and he told my parents that the risk must be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="110">Transfusions were given directly from donor to recipient via some <span class="spatial object">tube contraption</span> connecting their veins. </sentence><sentence id="111">My parents were standing over my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> knowing very well that any moment now, should my body reject the donor's blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes. </sentence><sentence id="112">The doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm. </sentence><sentence id="113">That's a good sign, he responded. </sentence><sentence id="114">He finished the transfusion and I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="115">He came back eight days later to take out the stitches and he couldn't believe his own eyes that I was alive. </sentence><sentence id="116">I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm. </sentence><sentence id="117">He suggested that I come to the <span class="building">hospital</span> after I get well to be examined thoroughly t find out how I managed to survive that ordeal. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was the same brother whose blood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">As it turned out, had I not had typhus at <span class="building">home</span> and developed immunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Can we ask a question, Susan did ----. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="190">5  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191"> (S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, after you had been in the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: When we were in the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>, i.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> yet in most of the General Government of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">The <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> there were formed in the spring of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="194">Except, of course, for the city of <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed in early 1940, because <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> was incorporated into the <span class="country">Reich</span>, (i.e. the city of <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and the entire <span class="region">province</span>) and the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was formed in October or November of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="195">Yes, it was a good question. </sentence><sentence id="196">Some people escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the <span class="dlf">border</span> which consisted of a simple <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> which wasn't electrified. </sentence><sentence id="197">Of course, if an inmate was caught before he reached the <span class="region">no-man's land</span> he would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="198">On the way to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the <span class="dlf">barbed wire fences</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">We saw the Soviet guards patrolling. </sentence><sentence id="200">Some officers came close to the <span class="dlf">fence</span> and talked to us. </sentence><sentence id="201">I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a Soviet Jewish captain. </sentence><sentence id="202">I wanted to escape, some of my friends did. </sentence><sentence id="203">They were all caught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them. </sentence><sentence id="204">Once you escaped across the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, you had to cross a stretch of <span class="region">no-man's land</span> of perhaps 50 feet of terrain to reach the <span class="dlf">Soviet fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">In most instances, the German guards couldn't see, when one forced the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands of wire and going through it. </sentence><sentence id="206">The guards were too thinly spread out. </sentence><sentence id="207">However, the escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral <span class="region">no-man's land</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">Since the guards couldn't shoot at them, they fired rounds in the <span class="env feature">air</span>, thereby alerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them. </sentence><sentence id="209">Even though, the Soviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of <span class="populated place">forced labor camps</span>, running for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies. </sentence><sentence id="210">Every single one of them was interrogated in the nearest <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Rava Ruska</span>, imprisoned and eventually sent to the <span class="building">northern gulags</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Ironically, through this act of callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police apparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet- occupied <span class="region">Polish territories</span>, they would have been killed a year later when the Nazis invaded the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span> and occupied those <span class="region">territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">I wanted to escape from the <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, no more than about 100 km south from our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">I had no notion under what ghastly conditions he lived in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span> as a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="214">However, I received a postcard from <span class="building">home</span> in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard <span class="building">home</span> from some <span class="building">rail station</span> on the old <span class="dlf">Polish-Soviet border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">In the card he told us that he is in <span class="spatial object">transport</span>, forcibly evacuated from <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, and going either to the <span class="region">Far East</span> or to <span class="region">the Caucasus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">Well, he wound up in the far <span class="region">North</span>, hundreds of kilometers north of <span class="populated place">Archangelsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">That postcard was dated July 1940. </sentence><sentence id="218">In the summer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees under their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped them to the <span class="building">northern gulags</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">That covered the vast majority of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="220">Once I found out that my brother was no longer in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>, I had no great desire to risk an escape attempt to face an unknown fate alone. </sentence><sentence id="221">I was too young then. </sentence><sentence id="222">Whether I would have been better off or not is hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="223">The chances are that I had as 6  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection good a chance to survive as to perish there. </sentence><sentence id="224">About half the people perished in the <span class="populated place">Soviet camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">However, I didn't escape and returned <span class="building">home</span> to face the real test of fending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">The last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="227">The liquidation of the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span> an the annihilation of the Jewish population there began in the summer of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="228">In some <span class="region">areas</span>, it started earlier. </sentence><sentence id="229">So about three or four months after I was shipped to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and my brother executed, my family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family were shipped to and annihilated at <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230"><span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> became the <span class="dlf">killing field</span> of the Jews from the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span> of the <span class="populated place">towns</span> and <span class="populated place">cities</span> in the districts of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and <span class="populated place">Radom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">In addition, of course, to devouring <span class="spatial object">transports</span> of Jews from all over <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">My personal saga began with my arrival at <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">My experience at the main <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for the conversion of civilians into prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="234">But <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> was hell. </sentence><sentence id="235">Time was not conceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days. </sentence><sentence id="236">If one survived the day, one achieved the unlikely. </sentence><sentence id="237">If one survived a month, one achieved the impossible. </sentence><sentence id="238">When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I had been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals, by the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a day or two, became aware of the fact that they won't survive too long. </sentence><sentence id="239">Later on, it became a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable hell. </sentence><sentence id="240">We didn't even know upon arrival that <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi killing machine of European Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="241">It took us several months to find out exactly what was going on right there. </sentence><sentence id="242">QO: Did you know that they were killing people in those places? </sentence><sentence id="243"> https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection The <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> were loaded at the <span class="populated place">Auschwitz railroad camp</span> and traveled the two miles to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>, passing the <span class="dlf">road</span> that surrounded the <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> <span class="building">camp complex</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">We sometimes saw the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> from inside the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and occasionally passed them by on the <span class="dlf">road</span> on our way to work. </sentence><sentence id="245">Most of my work, and the work of people around me, was involved in enlarging the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was an enormous universe of <span class="populated place">camps</span> which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a million prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="247">My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was digging the foundations for <span class="building">crematorium</span> one. </sentence><sentence id="248">By mid-summer of 1942, they had some crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from 16 to 25 years of age, and forming a <span class="building">masonry school</span> to teach us how to become bricklayers. </sentence><sentence id="249">I don't know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco. </sentence><sentence id="250">Not one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer. </sentence><sentence id="251">Many of the 800 did of typhus during the summer anyway, i.e., they were selected to go to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span> after contracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they didn't have to work outside in the heat of summer. </sentence><sentence id="252">With the rations that we received, compounded by the lack of <span class="env feature">water</span>, hard labor, sleepless nights and beatings, one did not last long. </sentence><sentence id="253">We were lucky that during a crucial period in the summer, we were indoors in <span class="building">barracks</span> receiving instruction on how to lay bricks. </sentence><sentence id="254">But it didn't prevent the <span class="building">SS</span> from performing selections among us. </sentence><sentence id="255">They took place every week. </sentence><sentence id="256">Those who looked weak or showed signs of illness or had abscesses or scars were selected to go to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="257">By the fall, the <span class="building">masonry school</span> (<span class="building">Maurerschule</span>) ceased to exist. </sentence><sentence id="258">Some of the remaining youngsters were sent to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> to work, and I was among those assigned to a work commando in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">The same kapo for whom I worked
