id="5">We cannot even walk." </sentence><sentence id="6">Somebody else said, "The guards may be hiding behind the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">They just wait for us to start running and they'll have an excuse to shoot us." </sentence><sentence id="8">So all day long we sat in that <span class="building">barn</span>, not knowing that the guards had run away. </sentence><sentence id="9">They escaped. </sentence><sentence id="10">You see we did not know whether the war was ending, where the positions of the armies were. </sentence><sentence id="11">We didn't even know that there were Allied forces. </sentence><sentence id="12">We didn't know a thing. </sentence><sentence id="13">In the evening, it was dark already, | remember it well, we heard footsteps of boots. </sentence><sentence id="14">Now up to this day when | hear boots marching, even on the beautiful parade, | get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said, "Oh, the henchmen are back." </sentence><sentence id="15">But we heard Russian language. </sentence><sentence id="16">Russian language, Russian soldiers, dear ladies, we didn't know you were here, we were, we are fighting the war, we found already a few other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">We cannot stay with you. </sentence><sentence id="18">We leave two, three people. </sentence><sentence id="19">Tomorrow there medics will come and help you. </sentence><sentence id="20">So all through the night we still stayed in that <span class="building">barn</span>, naturally we were free. </sentence><sentence id="21">Now what happened in that <span class="building">barn</span> the night of liberation? </sentence><sentence id="22">Some people applauded with their hands. </sentence><sentence id="23">They could hardly move them. </sentence><sentence id="24">Some people jumped up for joy.

now 50 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="28">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="29"> Nesse Godin 4 December 14, 1995 Page 4 years after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="30">And for 50 years, I'm trying to analyze, why did | cry? </sentence><sentence id="31">Did | cry for my family that was dead? </sentence><sentence id="32">At that point, | didn't know if anyone was alive because in that <span class="building">barn</span> | was alone. </sentence><sentence id="33">No one of my family. </sentence><sentence id="34">Did | cry for, because | didn't know what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="35">Did | cry for joy? </sentence><sentence id="36">But | came to a conclusion that | cried because | felt sorry for myself. </sentence><sentence id="37">| thought where am | going? </sentence><sentence id="38">There's no <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> to pick up and tell I'm coming <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">There's no <span class="building">home</span>, no family and sincerely, many kind people say, "Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don't see tears from you." </sentence><sentence id="40">| really cried that time the last time. </sentence><sentence id="41">So once in a while, | have a little tear in my eye. </sentence><sentence id="42">| learned to laugh and to love. </sentence><sentence id="43">But | never cry. </sentence><sentence id="44">So that was this night, the day of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="45">The following day, when the Russians came, they explained to us that the <span class="populated place">village</span> does not have a <span

</sentence><sentence id="49">They are going to try to take the little healthier women and bring them to the <span class="populated place">village</span>, put "em in the little <span

Russians. </sentence><sentence id="52">Some, in some <span class="building">homes</span> there were still some Germans that stayed. </sentence><sentence id="53">| know they spoke German, it was a <span class="region">German area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54"><span class="region">Pomerania</span>, mostly, Polish German, <span class="dlf">border</span> but this little <span class="populated place">village</span> was mostly German. </sentence><sentence id="55">They, so the Russians the next day came with little <span class="spatial object">carts</span>, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">| This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="57">It is

arms, and he carried me to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">| was nothing but skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="60">And he brought me to the <span class="populated place">village</span>, he put me in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> of that little <span class="interior space">room</span>, on a straw sack and he said that eventually somebody will come and help me and give me food. </sentence><sentence id="61">A little bit later, they brought another woman that they put next to me on the <span class="spatial object">straw sack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">This woman, I'm really sorry that | cannot remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="63">She was a teacher in one of the religious <span class="building">Yovna (ph) schools</span> and | knew her from before the war because | had friends that went to that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And when | saw her | was so glad that she was there next to me on that <span class="spatial object">straw sack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">At least | felt | had someone from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us. </sentence><sentence id="67">Also, some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="68">After | was there one day or two days, | really don't remember, one day, one of the women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, "What are you doing here with a dead person?" </sentence><sentence id="69">| didn't realize that the woman next to me was dead. </sentence><sentence id="70">They carried her out and | wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they're burying her or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="71">But | couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="72">So | thought let me look out and see how the <span class="region">free world</span> looks. </sentence><sentence id="73">Cause | hadn't seen the <span class="region">free world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">Could hardly get up. </sentence><sentence id="75">And there was a <span

freedom? </sentence><sentence id="79">What's outside? </sentence><sentence id="80">And what | saw was a monster. </sentence><sentence id="81">A reflection of a monster in that <span class="dlf">windowpane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">A person, eyes sunken in, really a skeleton covered with skin. </sentence><sentence id="83">That's what | saw. </sentence><sentence id="84">Like you see children for Halloween how they have these masks and | turned around to see who was behind me and there was no one there. </sentence><sentence id="85">And this is when | realized how | looked. </sentence><sentence id="86">How | looked. </sentence><sentence id="87">| did not really imagine that | looked that way. </sentence><sentence id="88">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="89">After a few days being in that <span class="building">house</span>, one, a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> or a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, | believe it was a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> that came and picked us up and took us to that makeshift <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">What | remember of that coming to the <span class="building">hospital</span>, | remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because | remember a burn of a, where they shaved. </sentence><sentence id="91">And then | didn't remember anything else. </sentence><sentence id="92">Not a thing. </sentence><sentence id="93">Next thing | remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that | shouldn't worry, I'm in a <span class="building">hospital</span> and he would love to know my name. </sentence><sentence id="94">Because they did not have time to register me when | became unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="95">According to what they told me | was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two different diseases. </sentence><sentence id="96">And him telling me that the most thing that he's worried about is that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn't have to be amputated. </sentence><sentence id="97">And as | started to tell him my age, people from down

Nesa that's you! </sentence><sentence id="100">We didn't know who this was. </sentence><sentence id="101">Everybody asked do you know this person?" </sentence><sentence id="102">And there were a few people from my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> that | knew and | really felt already more comfortable about it. </sentence><sentence id="103">So | was gettin" a little better. </sentence><sentence id="104">People started to leave from the <span class="building">hospital</span> and then | was transferred to another smaller <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="105">The main thing, the treatment was on my legs. </sentence><sentence id="106">And | don't even remember if | ever said that, if | gave this testimony or not but | really feel | should tell it now. </sentence><sentence id="107">| decided that | don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="108">After all this that | went through, the stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when | think back of it, it was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="109">| heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that <span class="building">hospital</span> there was a mother and a daughter and here | was all by myself. </sentence><sentence id="110">| thought what do you need to live for? </sentence><sentence id="111">So | decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a little food, | just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me. </sentence><sentence id="112">And she was, | thought of that, I'm terrible but now | think of her as wonderful, she told on me. </sentence><sentence id="113">So they wouldn't walk out from the <span class="interior space">room</span> until | finished the food. </sentence><sentence id="114">And | really recovered pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="115">My, what was at that point, | still had, you see at the very end on the death march | was beaten up severely. </sentence><sentence id="116">And | still had my face swollen. </sentence><sentence id="117">My toes had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like you see a snake change his skin?

there because | was alone for a while. </sentence><sentence id="122">And then one day they told me | have to go down to the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">The <span class="building">office</span> was like a little <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">And when | came down there, they said to me, "We are going to close this <span class="building">hospital</span> and you can go now. </sentence><sentence id="125">We feel you're in good shape. </sentence><sentence id="126">You can go." </sentence><sentence id="127">And | said to them, "Where should | go?" </sentence><sentence id="128">They said, "Well, you want to go up, where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="129">| said, "I'm from <span

years old. </sentence><sentence id="132">| don't know what to do." </sentence><sentence id="133">So they asked the lady that was next to me where she was from and she happened to be from <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Do you have her name? </sentence><sentence id="286">Do you remember her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: | don't, | remember her first name, Hannah, but | don't think | ever knew her last name. </sentence><sentence id="290">| don't think | ever knew it. </sentence><sentence id="291">She was very kind. </sentence><sentence id="292">She was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="293">She was more like a sister to me than a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="294">So we left, with the idea to go to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family. </sentence><sentence id="296">She was from <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span> and she really thought that maybe her child is alive. </sentence><sentence id="297">She wants to go back.

the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this hell, we have to make a meeting point, back <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="301">So okay. </sentence><sentence id="302">So this | had back in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="303">And | thought after all, we had a <span class="building">home</span>, we had a <span class="building">business</span>, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping. </sentence><sentence id="304">Maybe I'll find it. </sentence><sentence id="305">So that was my plan. </sentence><sentence id="306">So there we go. </sentence><sentence id="307">You couldn't go to the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, say | want to buy a ticket to go to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">Didn't work that way. </sentence><sentence id="309">See you are very young, | don't know if you understand that. </sentence><sentence id="310">That first it, it wasn't even, the war hadn't even ended yet, so a <span class="spatial object">military trucks</span> were going east and they were going west and they were going south. </sentence><sentence id="311"><span class="spatial object">Trains</span> were going back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="312">The Russians were looting <span class="country">Germany</span> and taking <span class="spatial object">machinery</span> back to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">So you hitchhiked. </sentence><sentence id="314">You hitchhiked on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, on a <span class="spatial object">freight train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit <span class="region">east</span>, they took you. </sentence><sentence id="316">They said, "You want to go up to this and this little <span class="populated place">town</span>, we'll take you." </sentence><sentence id="317">Then you have to wait for a next <span class="spatial object">train</span> and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="318">And this is the way we arrived in the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="319">When we arrived in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>, like through the <span class="dlf">grapevine</span> while we were traveling people were telling us that in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>, there is already <span class="building">shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">Christian relief, <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, Jewish relief, <span class="building">Hiyas</span> (ph), the <span class="building">Join</span> (ph), some kind of <span class="building">Jewish agencies</span> helping out refugees. </sentence><sentence id="321">All of a sudden we were called refugees. </sentence><sentence id="322">So, we were very glad to arrive in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">When we came This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

id="326">| remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big <span class="interior space">room</span>, we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that <span

by <span class="country">country</span> and divided each <span class="country">country</span> more or less by <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">And you, if let's

<span class="country">Lithuania</span> was called and surrounding. </sentence><sentence id="329">So | saw quite a few names there and | wrote down my name. </sentence><sentence id="330">That was in case somebody of your family comes. </sentence><sentence id="331">That's how you got connected. </sentence><sentence id="332">You see when | tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you

large <span class="populated place">cities</span>, they used to have a whole <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> maybe six, seven <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">And you had to go in through a <span class="dlf">gate</span> and it was closed for the night. </sentence><sentence id="336">And so we were assigned in that same <span class="interior space">courtyard</span>, a place. </sentence><sentence id="337">Now all that night | thought to myself, why didn't | write down my name within eyesight. </sentence><sentence id="338">| wrote it down kind of low in the <span class="spatial object">poster</span>, nobody's going to bend down and look for my name. </sentence><sentence id="339">| was 17, | wasn't too bright.
