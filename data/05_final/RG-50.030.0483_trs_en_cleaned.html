<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2376">Q: Tell me a little about it. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Let's move on to <span class="populated place">Speer</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn't like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this. </sentence><sentence id="2381">I mean, he got in touch with me having read, "Into That Darkness." </sentence><sentence id="2382">And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And Speer read, "Into That Darkness," which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights. </sentence><sentence id="2384">And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to. </sentence><sentence id="2385">Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically. </sentence><sentence id="2386">And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the <span class="region">western world</span>, tried to talk to Speer. </sentence><sentence id="2387">I mean, it would have been insane not to. </sentence><sentence id="2388">I didn't like him. </sentence><sentence id="2389">I saw him on <span class="spatial object">TV</span>, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books. </sentence><sentence id="2390">I thought he was an arrogant man. </sentence><sentence id="2391">His charm did not charm me. </sentence><sentence id="2392">| thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn't bear it. </sentence><sentence id="2393">So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed. </sentence><sentence id="2394">He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that's the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2395">I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2396">But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on "Vogue," and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2397">So it was all very interesting for him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Question"><p><sentence id="2422">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2423">A: But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don't know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from <span class="populated place">Speer</span>, all asking me, well when would I come to <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span>, and I mean wasn't I planning? </sentence><sentence id="2424">I was so often in <span class="country">Germany</span>, wasn't I -- blah, blah, blah, blah. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And finally I thought, what is the matter with me? </sentence><sentence id="2426">I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a <span class="spatial object">Stangl</span> on him, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2427">I'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="2428">You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him. </sentence><sentence id="2430">I've got to say, I mean really. </sentence><sentence id="2431">I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a <span class="populated place">Heidelberg</span> [indecipherable], and there was this humble man. </sentence><sentence id="2432">On the <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> he was just as arrogant as on <span class="spatial object">TV</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2433">So every tra - - telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility. </sentence><sentence id="2434">Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I'm all wrong about this. </sentence><sentence id="2436">What is this man, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2437">What is this? </sentence><sentence id="2438">And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our <span class="building">hotel</span>, I said, "Jesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn't think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?" </sentence><sentence id="2442">Don said, "Oh yes, you're crazy." </sentence><sentence id="2443">So -- so anyway, that's how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one's attitude changes. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Once -- as I told you, once -- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood. </sentence><sentence id="2445">I know that this is a -- a cliche thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it's not Freudian, it's -- it's purely human. </sentence><sentence id="2446">It doesn't apply to everybody either, I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="2447">Because you can have a rotten This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2448">It is not

in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections. </sentence><sentence id="2451">And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections. </sentence><sentence id="2452">He was extraordinary lonely as a child. </sentence><sentence id="2453">I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers. </sentence><sentence id="2454">He was very alone throughout his childhood. </sentence><sentence id="2455">And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. </sentence><sentence id="2456">So when he found Hitler, of course it must have been the most extraordinary experience. </sentence><sentence id="2457">And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son. </sentence><sentence id="2458">And a son who had never had a father, found a father. </sentence><sentence id="2459">It's as simple as that, really, except it's much more complicated. </sentence><sentence id="2460">But start with the simple things, and you find answers. </sentence><sentence id="2461">Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other. </sentence><sentence id="2462">They loved each other. </sentence><sentence id="2463">And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2464">And he never, never understood it really, until he was in <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>, and was alone, and could read. </sentence><sentence id="2465">You know, he read 5,000 books in <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And boy, he could read, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2467">And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="2468">He really did. </sentence><sentence id="2469">I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="2471">He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="2472">But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="2473">He could manage with anybody, actually. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

-- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2478">People, that it's not -- it's not where they come from, it -- but what they are. </sentence><sentence id="2479">Which is the only thing that counts. </sentence><sentence id="2480">I mean, it doesn't matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race. </sentence><sentence id="2481">I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race. </sentence><sentence id="2482">It's -- it's totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that's what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2483">So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And he did, I mean he -- he -- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him. </sentence><sentence id="2485">He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it. </sentence><sentence id="2486">He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And he was so right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
