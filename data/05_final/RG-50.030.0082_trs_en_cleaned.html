<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did it sharpen the will to live, knowing that that death could be so imminent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I think the will to live is something that does not need to be sharpened. </sentence><sentence id="242">I think it's there all the time and uh I think what happens is is they...the closer one feels that upon one's self, the the stronger the fight is. </sentence><sentence id="243">I've watched friends that had cancer and passed away and their will to live was so strong that uh one does not believe that death is around the comer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: So do you think that...of course, looking back because it would be hard to recall exactly what happened, but do you think that you you had to distance yourself or tuck it away in a part of your mind until you could deal with it and and just take the next step? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: I don't even think one thinks. </sentence><sentence id="258">I think or at least I felt that uh when danger is there you try to to stay...stay alive, stay out of it. </sentence><sentence id="259">I know one particular circumstance where I lost my mother, got separated in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">Didn't know where I was, nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="261">All I could hear was the Germans calling and shooting, and at that point... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Calling and shooting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Calling. </sentence><sentence id="270">Uh they knew people were around there. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were in the partisans at that time already and they were calling out give yourself up and you will survive, and, of course, spraying bullets over the the <span class="region">area</span>, and I remember going out to the <span class="dlf">clearing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">I forget...it's better to get shot than be lost in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and going out to the <span class="region">area</span> and watching the bullets hit the <span class="env feature">dirt</span> in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="273">It sort of makes a little puff when it hits the <span class="env feature">dirt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">Then I heard my mother calling me. </sentence><sentence id="275">It didn't take me (laughter) a split second to turn away and run, and that I remember very clearly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: When you thought about that decision, uh being lost and alone in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> or giving yourself up to be shot... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: No, not giving myself up. </sentence><sentence id="286">Sooner be shot than give myself up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: So you were going to willingly walk into... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="291"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="292">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="293"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Into a <span class="spatial object">bullet</span>..-yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: And...and why? </sentence><sentence id="297">Why... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Uh you have to understand that at that point we were very much aware of what Germans did to Jews and even though at that point there were no Jews alive that we knew of in any of the surrounding <span class="populated place">towns</span>, knowing that I'm Jewish and knowing what awaited me, don't you think it's easier to take a bullet at random than to have somebody point a gun between your eyes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Your family...you had a father and mother and a brother before the occupation and uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: There were uncles and aunts and grandparents... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: An extended family.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Let me go back chronologically a little bit in time and talk about how there became an awareness in your <span class="populated place">community</span> and in your family that the occupation was coming. </sentence><sentence id="311">Not everybody believed it, is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Uh you mean the German occupation? </sentence><sentence id="315">Well, once uh the Germans started to fight the Poles, once they declared war on <span class="country">Poland</span>, we knew that the Germans would be coming. </sentence><sentence id="316">Uh you must understand that we were already occupied by the Russian forces. </sentence><sentence id="317"><span class="country">Poland</span> was divided and it wasn't a matter of, you know, will they come. </sentence><sentence id="318">It was a question of when they will come, how quickly they will come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Did your <span class="populated place">community</span>...the Jews in your <span class="populated place">community</span>...you talked about toward the end knowing at that point what they did to Jews, but in the beginning you didn't really know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Stories filtered down. </sentence><sentence id="327">Uh stories filtered down about the fact that uh the Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> were being taken out of their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="328">Uh Jews from <span class="country">Poland</span> had run away uh because the Germans were coming in and occupying. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh some of them who came returned back because the conditions under the Russians were so bad too. </sentence><sentence id="330">Uh my family especially since we were called bourgeois (ph), rich Jews or rich people period, uh we were packed and waiting to be taken to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">That's what they did with with the rich people, uh resettling them. </sentence><sentence id="332">Probably would have been a blessing in disguise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: So you were a <span class="populated place">community</span> knowing that your fate lay either in the hands of the Germans or the Russians, and at that point, did...was there an awareness of what would be better or what would be worse, what your...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: There was an awareness of oppression under the Germans, but I don't think anybody uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="343">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="344"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection thought of being just shot to death, being eliminated or wiped off the face of the <span class="env feature">earth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="345">I don't think...as a child, of course, I didn't think about it, but I don't think the general <span class="populated place">community</span> was prepared for the type of holocaust that that happened and remember something else...all that did not start until a little later. </sentence><sentence id="346">The <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>...I mean we had no knowledge of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: But there was a ghettoization (ph) process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: Ghettoization process was not immediately. </sentence><sentence id="357">That was oh several months later. </sentence><sentence id="358">Uh the Germans came in in I think July and I know it was summer. </sentence><sentence id="359">And the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was not organizing... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: What year do you think that was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="367">That was 1941, and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> did not get established until the wintertime, so there were several months, maybe not...six months maybe, five months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: In the time between the time the Germans came in and occupied and the actual ghettoization, what was the transformation that took place in your <span class="populated place">community</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
