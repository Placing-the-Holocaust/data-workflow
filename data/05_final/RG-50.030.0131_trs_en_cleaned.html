<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: We were there for about a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="370">And then when the war started between <span class="country">Russia</span> and...and <span class="country">Germany</span>, that's when they liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="371">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="372">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Armny--to fight against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="373">Which my two brothers did. </sentence><sentence id="374">And we went to <span class="country">Kazakhstan</span>, which is a warm climate. </sentence><sentence id="375"><span class="country">Kazakhstan</span>, <span class="country">Uzbekistan</span> is near <span class="country">Iran</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; once you get out of the place that you don't want to be, you could always pick up something...did something different. </sentence><sentence id="391">So we got there in <span class="populated place">Tashkent</span>, and we worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="392">Which we didn't need any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="393">We didn't need any shoes. </sentence><sentence id="394">We didn't need anything. </sentence><sentence id="395">And we waited there for the war to be over and to go <span class="building">home</span> again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="408">You didn't just... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Well, there was also a big <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="413">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army. </sentence><sentence id="414">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much <span class="interior space">room</span>, so many shoes. </sentence><sentence id="415">Because my brother once worked in a <span class="building">bakery</span>; so he used to work at night. </sentence><sentence id="416">So we had only one pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="417">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older. </sentence><sentence id="418">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="419">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes. </sentence><sentence id="420">So...but I used to work. </sentence><sentence id="421">We used to cut <span class="populated place">saxaul</span> (ph) all day. </sentence><sentence id="422">Grows a certain <span class="dlf">branch</span> over there, it's called <span class="building">saxhaul</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="423">And this is like corn, you know. </sentence><sentence id="424">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="425">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive. </sentence><sentence id="426">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to <span class="country">Germany</span>, he would send a package to us. </sentence><sentence id="427">It was already after the war. </sentence><sentence id="428">So we should survive. </sentence><sentence id="429">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="430">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: You could save money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Well, we could...just for the <span class="spatial object">train</span> ride; because they wouldn't give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="454">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="456">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="457"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

It's...You cannot... But we had, because every time like... You know, every time my sister, she would have a dress. </sentence><sentence id="534">And then she would see--because she was the oldest--she would see that us kids that we were hungry or something. </sentence><sentence id="535">So she would take off that dress and go on the <span class="building">market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="536">And sell it, and get--sell it for bread, not money. </sentence><sentence id="537">And bring <span class="building">home</span> a little bread. </sentence><sentence id="538">So then, after a year and a half, there was nothing to sell no more. </sentence><sentence id="539">And she got... (Laughing) You know, she was left with her petticoat, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="540">But, Thank God, we all survived. </sentence><sentence id="541">I...my sisters and brothers live in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span>, and we are happy to be in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">What can I tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

You know, European people, they were not as old in years, but they looked older. </sentence><sentence id="596">It was...it was very hard, because they had to constantly take care of children. </sentence><sentence id="597">We were young children. </sentence><sentence id="598">But we tried to uh help them out as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="599">Because uh, you know, they couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="600">So we did work. </sentence><sentence id="601">We...my sisters ...my...whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="602">Even to go out to dig a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> or pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="603">We used to pick cotton. </sentence><sentence id="604">Or do something. </sentence><sentence id="605">Just to earn some money. </sentence><sentence id="606">And like the mother: you do have respect for your mother and father, you know. </sentence><sentence id="607">They were <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="608">Even though my father, when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish people, he would teach them Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="609">He would teach them Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="610">He spoke very good Russian, very good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="611">So he would [teach] the younger people...
