information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal =) trips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was Karliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> and we had wonderful times. </sentence><sentence id="140">It was like a <span class="building">resort</span> into the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> which was <span class="building">resort</span> was called <span class="building">Reinerts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">And I don't really know what kind of <span class="env feature">mountains</span> they were, but I do remember having a wonderful time up there with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="142">Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals on them telling you what <span class="populated place">city</span> you were in which I thought fascinating. </sentence><sentence id="143">And it usually was around my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="144">So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> so that they could surprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me. </sentence><sentence id="145">I surely didn't expect it because I mean we were so far away from <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">But they did that for me. </sentence><sentence id="147">And going back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said. </sentence><sentence id="148">And she was born in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">Our regular <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">We didn't have a <span class="building">house</span> in this case. </sentence><sentence id="151">But she was born and my cousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister. </sentence><sentence id="152">And she didn't tell her husband that she was going to have the baby that soon. </sentence><sentence id="153">So when he came <span class="building">home</span>, that's my uncle, uncle Herbert was his name. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was aunt Ruth's husband. </sentence><sentence id="155">He came <span class="building">home</span> and he said what are you doing in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="156">And she said oh nothing. </sentence><sentence id="157">I didn't feel that good. </sentence><sentence id="158">She says, go look at the <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>, the <span class="spatial object">doll carriage</span> that Margie has. </sentence><sentence id="159">And he said what. </sentence><sentence id="160">I've seen that <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> and the dolls a million times before. </sentence><sentence id="161">And she says go take a look and go look at it again. </sentence><sentence id="162">Well finally to get him to do that, I urged him on. </sentence><sentence id="163">So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy. </sentence><sentence id="164">And he looked in there and there was this child. </sentence><sentence id="165">My doll's name was Suzy so he didn't know that it was areal child. </sentence><sentence id="166">But it was so funny because he couldn't get over it, that this little baby was in my <span class="spatial object">carriage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">And he had no idea what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="168">And then my sister came a few, exactly two weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="169">One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19% of October. </sentence><sentence id="170">But my dad was out of <span class="populated place">town</span> as usual. </sentence><sentence id="171">And he did have an inkling that when he came This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="172">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="173"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal 6 back there would be a child there. </sentence><sentence id="174">And sure enough. </sentence><sentence id="175">In those days you didn't go to a <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">You had a midwife. </sentence><sentence id="177">And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were like my own doll. </sentence><sentence id="178">And I was able to hold them and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="179">So that kind of grew because when I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of taking care of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="180">And I would, I roll her up and down the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">But then being a young kid, you know you kind of forget about what you're supposed to be doing. </sentence><sentence id="182">And a girlfriend of mine would say hey let's play hopscotch. </sentence><sentence id="183">So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head over onto the <span class="env feature">cement</span>, screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">I thought oh my I'm going to really get it. </sentence><sentence id="185">| came <span class="building">home</span> because my, they could hear. </sentence><sentence id="186">I guess the whole <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> could hear my sister. </sentence><sentence id="187">She was really upset and a little hurt but not really drastically. </sentence><sentence id="188">And I came <span class="building">home</span> and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened what happened. </sentence><sentence id="189">And I said she fell kind of with the <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> on the cement. </sentence><sentence id="190">How could you. </sentence><sentence id="191">And my grandmother said what do you expect a child. </sentence><sentence id="192">She's still a child herself. </sentence><sentence id="193">You shouldn't punish her. </sentence><sentence id="194">So I got away with that one too. </sentence><sentence id="195">And later on we, where I was living they had always a fair once a year. </sentence><sentence id="196">And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these <span class="spatial object">house wagons</span> lined up along the <span class="dlf">plaza</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a <span class="building">market</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="198">and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair. </sentence><sentence id="199">They would have <span class="spatial object">carousels</span> and big <span class="spatial object">wheel</span> and that was a big treat for us. </sentence><sentence id="200">And because my sister was too small, we couldn't' take her and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age. </sentence><sentence id="201">And this was maybe when they were about three or four years old. </sentence><sentence id="202">And one night I remember very well, my aunt goes <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life. </sentence><sentence id="204">Where could the child have gone to. </sentence><sentence id="205">She was gone. </sentence><sentence id="206">We combed the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">Everybody was running around and finally we located her oh maybe a half a <span class="dlf">block</span> away. </sentence><sentence id="208">Somebody had seen her walking as a little This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="209">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="210"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal 7 kid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your mom will come. </sentence><sentence id="211">And sure enough she was sitting in the <span class="dlf">window</span> looking out and when my aunt came by she said oh there's my mommy. </sentence><sentence id="212">And that was one of the things I really remember. </sentence><sentence id="213">Very, very well. </sentence><sentence id="214">I went to the <span class="building">Jewish school</span> and that, that was a wonderful place. </sentence><sentence id="215">When I first got there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big <span class="interior space">hall</span> and you went from one doctor to the next. </sentence><sentence id="216">One was a doctor for general. </sentence><sentence id="217">Then there was a doctor for looking in the eyes. </sentence><sentence id="218">There was a dentist that looked in your <span class="interior space">mouth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">And of course they wanted us to be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals. </sentence><sentence id="220">Anyway, I wasn't about to do that. </sentence><sentence id="221">I was too ashamed to show my body. </sentence><sentence id="222">And they said it's ok, you can do that. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I said no. </sentence><sentence id="224">I took my clothes and ran down the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and I didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="225">So then the teacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from <span class="building">school</span> and my mother said no, why would she do that. </sentence><sentence id="226">And she said well she didn't want to undress. </sentence><sentence id="227">And my mother said, well of course. </sentence><sentence id="228">She's very shameful of showing her body you know. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I never lived that one down. </sentence><sentence id="230">Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it. </sentence><sentence id="231">The kids used to kind of snicker when they saw me. </sentence><sentence id="232">What are you ashamed of. </sentence><sentence id="233">You're not developed yet or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="234">But it's I was only about six years old. </sentence><sentence id="235">And I mean to me my body was kind of precious and I wasn't about to show it off to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="236">And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name is Eva Renart. </sentence><sentence id="237">I don't know if I mentioned it prior to this. </sentence><sentence id="238">She went to <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, also a <span class="building">Jewish kindergarten</span> and she had a wonderful time as well. </sentence><sentence id="239">And as I think back, we, my parents well that is my mother and father if he was in <span class="populated place">town</span>, and my aunt and her husband, they went to the <span class="building">temple</span> every Saturday faithfully. </sentence><sentence id="240">Of course in those days you didn't hire any baby sitters, you used the older child. </sentence><sentence id="241">That was me. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I would have to play <span class="building">house</span> and entertain the young ones. </sentence><sentence id="243">And that was kind of fun because we played <span class="building">house</span> and I was always the mother and they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="244">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked

the children. </sentence><sentence id="246">And of course they had to behave. </sentence><sentence id="247">Otherwise I would punish them and put them in a <span class="interior space">corner</span> or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="248">And those are really very, very good memories for me because I enjoyed what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="249">And then in see we lived in <span class="region">upper Silesia</span>, so we were protected by the <span class="populated place">Versailles</span> contract or however you want to call it. </sentence><sentence id="250">I'm not sure exactly the wording. </sentence><sentence id="251">But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us. </sentence><sentence id="252">But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to leave out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">So my dad couldn't go anymore to the in his business to the <span class="env feature">Polish forests</span> and to the <span class="country">Czechoslovakia Russia</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="254">So the Nazis took him for forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="255">And he was digging <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and they were there was water accumulated over there. </sentence><sentence id="256">And he got quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="257">So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our uncles. </sentence><sentence id="258">That is my grandmother's brothers who lived in <span class="populated place">Battle Creek</span>, <span class="region">Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="259">They posted an affidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don't know, he was very smart man. </sentence><sentence id="260">He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="261">So he decided rather than waiting in <span class="country">Germany</span> we should go ahead and go to another <span class="country">country</span> that's affiliated with the <span class="country">United States</span>, wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they would give it to us, then we could go to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">That was the plan. </sentence><sentence id="263">However, that wasn't exactly what took place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: Before we get to the to your leaving <span class="country">Germany</span>, I want to go back a little bit so I don't forget. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="403">Why don't we talk a little bit about what you remember about where you lived, what your parents were like, what it was like when your grandparents moved into the <span class="building">house</span> with you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke. </sentence><sentence id="405">They could not, my grandmother wasn't able to take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="406">So we had moved into a place that had three This is a verbatim transcript of

my parents. </sentence><sentence id="410">One was occupied by we rented out one and the other one was my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="411">And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful <span class="interior space">room</span> and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them. </sentence><sentence id="412">Oh let me tell you something else that happened. </sentence><sentence id="413">When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that. </sentence><sentence id="414">We had Passover and my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox family. </sentence><sentence id="415">So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn't get up. </sentence><sentence id="416">So he sat there and asked the children. </sentence><sentence id="417">Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of tiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a <span class="spatial object">playpen</span> exactly but something where they could contain them because they were just crawling around at that point. </sentence><sentence id="418">And all of a sudden I said you know dad, you look like a beggar. </sentence><sentence id="419">Oh, my dad got so upset at me. </sentence><sentence id="420">How dare I say you look like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he couldn't speak very well, start in his own way yelling. </sentence><sentence id="421">Well the women all were in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> trying to bring the food out. </sentence><sentence id="422">When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to yell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the <span class="interior space">kitchen floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">That was my mother, my aunt and my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="424">They came running. </sentence><sentence id="425">What in the world happened. </sentence><sentence id="426">And when we told them what happened, well it wasn't a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="427">But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so upset that I said that. </sentence><sentence id="428">Our <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="429">I think it was more like Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="430">So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> were all Christian kids. </sentence><sentence id="431">So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves. </sentence><sentence id="432">And they would call us and say come on and play with me. </sentence><sentence id="433">And I would go out and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="434">And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference. </sentence><sentence id="435">So to me I was accepted as their equal. </sentence><sentence id="436">There was no discrimination. </sentence><sentence id="437">The schooling had to be in, I had to go to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> because I guess maybe the others wouldn't accept us. </sentence><sentence id="438">I really don't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

fifth. </sentence><sentence id="442">Like I said before. </sentence><sentence id="443">And that's the only way there was. </sentence><sentence id="444">But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance. </sentence><sentence id="445">And do gymnastics. </sentence><sentence id="446">So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a <span class="building">school</span> for gymnastics and I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher. </sentence><sentence id="447">Or a ballerina. </sentence><sentence id="448">Anything that had to do with dance or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="449">And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much. </sentence><sentence id="450">And then we would put on plays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our

mother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes. </sentence><sentence id="453">One of the ones that I really remember is that I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower. </sentence><sentence id="454">So I could dance around a lot. </sentence><sentence id="455">And we, these are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is when <span class="building">school</span> would let out. </sentence><sentence id="456">I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls hada <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">Well I didn't have one. </sentence><sentence id="458">So she would let me ride the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="459">Well the first time I got onto the <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, I headed right straight for the <span class="env feature">rose bushes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">And I came out of there looking and a mess, scratched up from head to toe. </sentence><sentence id="461">You might say. </sentence><sentence id="462">But I didn't care because I had fun. </sentence><sentence id="463">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="464">I was learning how to ride the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="465">I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it. </sentence><sentence id="466">And let's see what else. </sentence><sentence id="467">The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best friend. </sentence><sentence id="468">And she didn't live all that far away but not in our immediate <span class="region">area</span>, so only time I could play with her was either right after <span class="building">school</span> or when my mother would take me over there and pick me up because we just didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="469">And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only know now the last name, Richar, was her name. </sentence><sentence id="470">And they went to <span class="country">Israel</span> as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="471">But I couldn't be very sure. </sentence><sentence id="472">People left you know, some had left already. </sentence><sentence id="473">The moment in 1935 they would leave and go. </sentence><sentence id="474">But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were in <span class="country">Germany</span> as long as I was. </sentence><sentence id="475">Now there was another girlfriend that I had.

</sentence><sentence id="481">I didn't even know she would be here. </sentence><sentence id="482">So but let me go, get back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="483">While I was in <span class="building">school</span> I learned English. </sentence><sentence id="484">However it was not the English that people in <span class="country">America</span> talk or in the <span class="country">Philippines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="485">It was <span class="populated place">Oxford English</span>. </sentence><sentence id="486">The eithers and the neithers and the looking glass and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="487">Well when I left <span class="country">Germany</span> and I went to another <span class="building">school</span>, the kids all made fun of me. </sentence><sentence id="488">Because I didn't speak like any of them. </sentence><sentence id="489">And they would snicker and laugh and like ridicule me. </sentence><sentence id="490">And I felt really bad about that because that's the only English I did know. </sentence><sentence id="491">But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa. </sentence><sentence id="492">My dad like I said kind of saw the writing on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> and he said we're now leaving. </sentence><sentence id="493">So in <span class="country">Germany</span> you hardly bought any dresses ready-made. </sentence><sentence id="494">Everything had to be made. </sentence><sentence id="495">By material and the <span class="building">dressmakers</span> and the <span class="building">dressmakers</span> were a few <span class="dlf">blocks</span> away of course. </sentence><sentence id="496">And so my mother had started putting things into <span class="spatial

you'd better get out now. </sentence><sentence id="498">They're going to be closing the <span class="dlf">border</span> to <span class="country">France</span> which is <span class="populated

things into the <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it. </sentence><sentence id="500">Once it was sealed you could not break the seal unless you were outside <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="501">So I remember us rushing through and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did.

bride and groom because we were always together. </sentence><sentence id="771">Like I said my grandma and I had a wonderful relationship and when I had to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> and leave her behind, that was really one of the hardest things I had to do. </sentence><sentence id="772">I didn't' care so much about my aunt and uncle that were there who I loved dearly too but my grandmother and I had a wonderful relationship. </sentence><sentence id="773">As a matter of fact, when my grandfather died, I moved into the <span class="interior space">room</span> with her. </sentence><sentence id="774">So the two of us shared a <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="775">And at night she would have some chocolate and of course I had to have it. </sentence><sentence id="776">And none of the others did but I got it. </sentence><sentence id="777">So when I would go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a girlfriend in <span class="populated place">Boyden</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="778">That was oh not that far away but it was far enough.

she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="781">And she loved those so whenever I went to <span class="populated place">Boyden</span>, I had a little money saved up. </sentence><sentence id="782">I would buy that for her so I could bring it back to her. </sentence><sentence id="783">And she appreciated it so much. </sentence><sentence id="784">Well, that's the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: No I think they tried to shield us from all that. </sentence><sentence id="901">No, I, I don't' ever remember them saying much of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to. </sentence><sentence id="902">And until the time we left there was really no major problems. </sentence><sentence id="903">In fact one of my Christian

we all were. </sentence><sentence id="905">Cause there was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it. </sentence><sentence id="906">And they kept it from us. </sentence><sentence id="907">They did not want to share because this was very disturbing and they didn't want to put us into that. </sentence><sentence id="908">My sister Eva, she was a very timid person. </sentence><sentence id="909">She was shy and but she loved to eat. </sentence><sentence id="910">Oh boy did she love to eat. </sentence><sentence id="911">And whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and

</sentence><sentence id="914">And before we left, my mother always gave us something to eat because she loved to eat. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact.

around like that. </sentence><sentence id="920">so that's why I guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the <span class="spatial object">squab</span> and all that stuff, veal

id="942">I think it was really something. </sentence><sentence id="943">Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem. </sentence><sentence id="944">When I walked with them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm's length. </sentence><sentence id="945">I couldn't even bring them together. </sentence><sentence id="946">But like I said my sister followed me

anything and her name was Margot Friedlander. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And his name was Heinrich Friedlander. </sentence><sentence id="1479">Well anyway so we get finally, the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> arrives. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And it was a great big <span class="spatial object">passenger ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Of course to us kids who had never seen a <span class="spatial object">steamer</span>, never seen anything. </sentence><sentence id="1482">We come from a very small <span class="populated place">town</span>, as I mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And oh in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, I saw my first black people. </sentence><sentence id="1484">I had never seen anybody but white people because there were, we were too far away from everything. </sentence><sentence id="1485">But in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> there were a number of other nationalities . </sentence><sentence id="1486">And when we finally got on board the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, we realized oh there are more children. </sentence><sentence id="1487">There was one was <span class="populated place">Margot Kassel</span> and Biata Zuskind and Biata was a smaller child. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And my sister was going to have a birthday on that trip. </sentence><sentence id="1489">It would have been October the 19". </sentence><sentence id="1490">All right. </sentence><sentence id="1491">so my mother bought a cake for her at one of the <span

class="spatial object">board</span> and we were going to have it for dessert. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Well we come across this beggar on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1510">My sister turns around, runs back up onto <span class="spatial object">board</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1511">We didn't know why she was running back and we called her and she was already up the <span class="dlf">gangplank</span> and already gone, comes back with the cake. </sentence><sentence id="1512">She's giving it to the beggar. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And my mother just having fits. </sentence><sentence id="1514">She just said this was your cake Eva, what are you giving away? </sentence><sentence id="1515">That poor man has nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1516">So my mother, what did she do. </sentence><sentence id="1517">She took some money. </sentence><sentence id="1518">Gave the money to the beggar and took the cake back which we had after all. </sentence><sentence id="1519">But that's how Eva is. </sentence><sentence id="1520">She will take off her shirt and give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Very, very soft hearted person. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Anyway so on board <span class="spatial object">ship</span> we met a lot of other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Like I said Margot Kassel was my sister's age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe three years old at that time, two or three years old. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And things were pretty good but I don't like, I didn't know any French food. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And for me to start eating French food when I'm used to the regular <span class="interior space">kosher German kitchen</span>, you know was quite a change. </sentence><sentence id="1526">So I said and I did say something to my dad. </sentence><sentence id="1527">I don't remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I'm going to write to my grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here. </sentence><sentence id="1528">You are treating me not well at all. </sentence><sentence id="1529">I told my dad. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Uh oh. </sentence><sentence id="1531">That was the wrong thing to say, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1532">So he said you This is a

more heavy than she already has. </sentence><sentence id="1536">I mean the poor woman has just lost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell her how miserable things are here. </sentence><sentence id="1537">You better not. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Well he was right. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Of course, I didn't but needless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way. </sentence><sentence id="1540">so I had to adjust to the food. </sentence><sentence id="1541">But you know I missed my tomatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1543">So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and I mentioned it to him. </sentence><sentence id="1544">They all spoke some German. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And I told him that I really missed having a fresh tomato. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Guess what. </sentence><sentence id="1547">At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato. </sentence><sentence id="1548">That was the best meal I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but the food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we went from <span class="populated place">Port Said</span>, we went over to <span class="populated place">Porti</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1550">Oh, <span class="dlf">Suez Canal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Let me not forget the <span class="dlf">Suez Canal</span> which was a very exciting experience. </sentence><sentence id="1552">You could see across the <span class="building">bank</span> and you could see <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1553">I mean <span class="building">buildings</span>, I would say more like <span class="building">pyramids</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And you see the Arabs and I mean it was so close. </sentence><sentence id="1555">It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you'd better remember this very well. </sentence><sentence id="1556">This may be your last time you're going to go through <span class="dlf">Suez Canal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1557">This is something that is very, very important for you to know. </sentence><sentence id="1558">So we really stayed on <span class="spatial object">board</span> and looked at everything. </sentence><sentence id="1559">And then we came to <span class="country">Djibouti</span> and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1560">They said oh she is so cute. </sentence><sentence id="1561">My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair. </sentence><sentence id="1562">I mean she was very adorable. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And they, the woman wouldn't give up. </sentence><sentence id="1564">She wanted to buy my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1565">My sister said no, she's not for sale. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her so we were always around her. </sentence><sentence id="1567">I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her every second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something. </sentence><sentence id="1568">And then we went to <span class="country">Singapore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1569"><span class="populated place">Singapore</span> was just beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1570">It was absolutely lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1571">But hot. </sentence><sentence id="1572">It was so hot This is a

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal 30 and we just came from <span class="country">Germany</span> and we are in autumn already in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And we come over there and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat. </sentence><sentence id="1576">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="1577">But anyway we did take a walk and strolled in a little bit on the <span class="dlf">pier</span> and then it was too much. </sentence><sentence id="1578">And we had to turn back to the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1579">So we never really got to see <span class="populated place">Singapore</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1580">And then from there my next recollection was getting to <span class="populated place">Saigon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1581">Now <span class="populated place">Saigon</span> my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet type things and he looked really chic and he wore that on <span class="interior space">deck</span> all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1582">But in <span class="populated place">Saigon</span> we stayed there two days. </sentence><sentence id="1583">We had French legionnaires on board. </sentence><sentence id="1584">And these poor guys didn't have wine or anything so the men at our <span class="spatial object">table</span> took the wine from our <span class="spatial object">table</span> and took it over there to these guys. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French. </sentence><sentence id="1586">You know how that, it is. </sentence><sentence id="1587">So they were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="1588">But before I even get that far. </sentence><sentence id="1589">Let me say something else. </sentence><sentence id="1590">For days, there were, the people, the officers on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> said "Keep an eye on the back of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1591">We have a <span class="dlf">line</span> out. </sentence><sentence id="1592">We hope to catch a <span class="env feature">whale</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1593">Oh boy. </sentence><sentence id="1594">With us kids, we were always checking the <span class="dlf">line</span> that was hanging out of the back of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And we'd see it trailing you know. </sentence><sentence id="1596">But nothing is happening, nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1597">One day finally there was a big thing, intercom and attention, attention. </sentence><sentence id="1598">We caught whale. </sentence><sentence id="1599">I want most, everybody on <span class="spatial object">board</span>, children first. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Let them see the <span class="env feature">whale</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1601">Before we cut the <span class="env feature">whale</span> open. </sentence><sentence id="1602">So oh boy. </sentence><sentence id="1603">I mean we were in the <span class="interior space">lounge</span> as a matter of fact, in the <span class="interior space">ladies lounge</span>, washing our hands and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And we run <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> to the <span class="interior space">deck</span> where the <span class="dlf">line</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And there was this long fish, dripping <span class="env feature">water</span> still, black fish, very impressive, big huge thing. </sentence><sentence id="1606">And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here. </sentence><sentence id="1607">There weren't that many children on board because this was a <span class="spatial object">luxury liner</span> really and was dropping off the legionnaires to <span class="populated place">Saigon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And so it was very, very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1609">So we all rushed up there and were standing with bated breath. </sentence><sentence id="1610">Now they're going to cut the fish open, going to see what's inside the fish. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And you know what This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1613">It is not the primary

not sure what exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1618">But it was so thrilling. </sentence><sentence id="1619">All these candies fell out and they were green and different colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the <span class="env feature">whale</span> or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1620">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1621">But it was so funny. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And, oh he said take all the candy you want. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Of course, we kids, candy. </sentence><sentence id="1624">We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too. </sentence><sentence id="1625">So this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Other than that I mean that was really nothing much happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1752">Q: I think you had told me that your parents had pre-paid for the entire trip while you were still in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1753">It was a kind of <span class="spatial object">package</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Why don't you tell me a little bit about that and how if you know anything, how they knew how to go about doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1755">And another question was how many immigrants and refugees there were on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1756">From other <span class="country">countries</span> besides <span class="country">France</span> and doing something similar to what you were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1762">A: No the only people were from <span class="country">Germany</span> and they were the only refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And like I said there was only this one young family. </sentence><sentence id="1764">And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with Zuskind. </sentence><sentence id="1765">That was the other one. </sentence><sentence id="1766">That I believe was all there was on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, as far as Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And the other ones, I don't, there were French people going to <span class="country">Singapore</span>, <span class="populated place">Saigon</span>, really not a whole lot of people but we only knew about ours. </sentence><sentence id="1768">And I did not mention this but the men slept separately from the women. </sentence><sentence id="1769">So we had in our <span class="interior space">cabin</span> was this young woman that was just married, my mother and my sister and I, four of us. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And in dad's <span class="interior space">cabin</span> there were also four men. </sentence><sentence id="1771">So they had for some reason, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I guess they didn't have the facilities to accommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1773">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1774"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal 32 <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And I believe the <span class="building">HIAS</span> was helping us. </sentence><sentence id="1776">But I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1777">I never did question them how, when and where and what. </sentence><sentence id="1778">All I know is that we had the money that we had to put down in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> to the <span class="building">American consulate</span> and vouch that we would never be a burden to any government. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1798">Q: Also I wanted to ask you, did you have a German passport. </sentence><sentence id="1799">Do you remember that? </sentence><sentence id="1800">When you left <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1804">A: We did and it all over <span class="populated place">Juden</span> ok. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And by that time we were stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1806">We did not have any more a <span class="building">home</span>, so we were considered stateless. </sentence><sentence id="1807">And in <span class="populated place">Singapore</span>, my sister and were always on <span class="interior space">deck</span> looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really. </sentence><sentence id="1808">There were no movies. </sentence><sentence id="1809">If there were, they would have been in French. </sentence><sentence id="1810">We would never have understood anyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and talk and do things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1811">So I was looking into the <span class="interior space">hold</span> of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>, I see that our <span class="spatial object">box</span> that we had our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> in, our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I would say like <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Oh, the few goblets of crystal. </sentence><sentence id="1814">I mean painstakingly wrapped. </sentence><sentence id="1815">It was a big <span class="spatial object">wooden box</span>, they called them <span class="spatial object">lifts</span> in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1816">And that had broken open. </sentence><sentence id="1817">And with all of those natives there, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn't have anything left when we got to the <span class="country">Philippines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1818">So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can get ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again. </sentence><sentence id="1819">Or nail it together, whatever it takes. </sentence><sentence id="1820">Cause I don't' want to lose all our stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1821">So she was standing on top there looking down. </sentence><sentence id="1822">And I found my father pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="1823">And I said come quick, come quick. </sentence><sentence id="1824">Look what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="1825">So he ran and got the captain and they went down

class="country">Philippines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1831">The soap had spilled out onto the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1832">The <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> had rusted away. </sentence><sentence id="1833">So by that time we really didn't have a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1834">We didn't' have much of soap. </sentence><sentence id="1835">I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1836">But anyways so that was in <span class="populated place">Saigon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And on the way from <span class="populated place">Saigon</span> to <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span> came the typhoon. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Everybody was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1839">Everybody was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1840">We couldn't go to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1841">And oh my dad's hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in <span class="populated place">Saigon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1842">Went overboard and it was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1843">He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice helmet type thing that they wore in the <span class="country">Orient</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1844">Anyway so we were too sick to eat. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1845">But my dad was at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, eating. </sentence><sentence id="1846">I mean we could never understand how could you eat. </sentence><sentence id="1847">We were so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn't hold food down and we couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1848">I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Except my dad and this young guy that had just gotten married. </sentence><sentence id="1850">The two of them had the whole <span class="interior space">dining room</span> to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1851">And they had all the food they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And they had to put the plates into <span class="spatial object">containers</span> which were bolted to the <span class="spatial object">tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1853">Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1854">But we finally made it into <span class="populated place">Kowloon</span> which is <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span> <span class="country">China</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1855">But we had to stay in <span class="populated place">Kowloon</span> because that's where the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> docked. </sentence><sentence id="1856">Now we needed shots in <span

had an office in this <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1858">The <span class="dlf">staircase</span> was so narrow and so dark that we could hardly see where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="1859">Well my imagination was oh my god he's going to abduct us and we're not going to go get anywhere and we're going to be sold as slaves or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1860">Like I said I had a very vivid imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1861">And we made it up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Got our shots, came back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know. </sentence><sentence id="1863">We were kind of crying cause it was hurting. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And my dad said

</sentence><sentence id="1871">So he said how about we buy Suzie a dress. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my parents into this beautiful <span

id="1880">Now I was going to experience Chinese food. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Which was again something different, but noodles I liked so that was ok. </sentence><sentence id="1882">We ate a lot of noodles. </sentence><sentence id="1883">And we did take a trip also over to <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span> which is by <span class="spatial object">ferry boat</span> which was kind of exciting for us as well. </sentence><sentence id="1884">So we were a few days in, I can't remember exactly the how many days we were in <span class="populated place">Hong Kong</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1885">But then we were on our way to the <span class="country">Philippines</span> on a not with a <span class="spatial object">passenger ship</span> which I thought we would have. </sentence><sentence id="1886">No. </sentence><sentence id="1887">We had to leave the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and go on a <span class="spatial object">freighter</span>, a small <span class="spatial object">freighter</span> and there we were all in one <span class="interior space">cabin</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="1888">But my dad always liked to have the round <span class="dlf">window</span>, the <span class="dlf">portholes</span> opened because he liked it. </sentence><sentence id="1889">So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it was me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And he started coughing and screaming and yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly. </sentence><sentence id="1892">But then we laughed and he says what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1893">What did you guys do. </sentence><sentence id="1894">And you know how kids do pranks like that. </sentence><sentence id="1895">So we told him, it was only a raisin. </sentence><sentence id="1896">Well the next day he was sleeping again, the <span class="dlf">window</span> open again. </sentence><sentence id="1897">This time a big wave came and he thought we're drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1898">He's screaming we're drowning, we're drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1899">Why don't we all jump. </sentence><sentence id="1900">You know he thought for sure we were drowning. </sentence><sentence id="1901">As it was, a wave had come

came at just now I had a loss of memory again but itll get back to me, ok. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And we were met at the <span class="dlf">docks</span> by the Jewish committee and they took us to a <span class="building">hotel</span> in the <span class="populated place">walled city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1916">The <span class="populated place">walled city</span> is called <span

place">Manila</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1918">That was a <span class="building">fortress</span> and so this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they warned us don't leave any food out. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Because of the rats that go around these old <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Oh my gosh. </sentence><sentence id="1921">Now we are afraid of rats as well. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I mean I love animals, but I don't' think I'd like rats. </sentence><sentence id="1923">So we would take food <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And they still got to it. </sentence><sentence id="1925">So we still all the food we brought <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> was eaten you know nibbled on during the night by these stupid rats. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And we only stayed there like 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="1927">And then the Jewish committee said we'll give, tell you where you can go and rent something. </sentence><sentence id="1928">So we rented the <span

on me again. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> where he came from. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And we don't know which <span class="spatial object">ship</span> he came on because there were quite a few refugees at that time, already. </sentence><sentence id="1939">Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding them. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Well we didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1941">so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I can't even get out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="1942">So finally somebody looked down. </sentence><sentence id="1943">All the <span class="dlf">windows</span> in the <span

id="1947">We asked the dentist <span class="interior space">downstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1948">Oh he said easy. </sentence><sentence id="1949">They are on a <span class="env

id="1951">They took all of his money. </sentence><sentence id="1952">They took his papers and everything else but they left his pants. </sentence><sentence id="1953">So that was our one experience.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2003">A: A far cry from <span class="country">Germany</span>, a very far cry. </sentence><sentence id="2004">There were <span class="env feature">palm

</sentence><sentence id="2006">And we could crack them open, but first they had a <span class="dlf">green hull</span> around them which had to be stripped, but they all carried knives, bolos, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2007">And so like hatchet, big hatchet things. </sentence><sentence id="2008">Oh very vicious looking deals. </sentence><sentence id="2009">And that's what they used to do. </sentence><sentence id="2010">But I could not see any <span class="env feature">jungle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2011">I mean these were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

class="env feature">jungle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Well it didn't quite happen that way. </sentence><sentence id="2017">We only stayed in there one month because that was no place for us, when they can hook something and take things out of there. </sentence><sentence id="2018">That was not for us. </sentence><sentence id="2019">So then again we have asked the <span class="building">Jewish committee</span>, where we could go and where we could live. </sentence><sentence id="2020">So they said well there is a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2021">I'll show you but you have to share it with another family. </sentence><sentence id="2022">Well no problem, I mean, that's fine. </sentence><sentence id="2023">So we met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2024">The daughter was just a couple of years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="2025">And so that was a beautiful <span class="building">complex</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2026">It was, it belonged to I think a mayor, Resal. </sentence><sentence id="2027">His last name was Resal. </sentence><sentence id="2028">I don't remember his first name. </sentence><sentence id="2029">But there are a lot of <span class="building">Resals</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="2030">There are lot, it's a very popular name. </sentence><sentence id="2031">And this <span class="building">house</span> was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="2032">It had, downstairs was a <span class="interior space">hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2033">Cause it was like a <span class="building">dance hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2034">Oh it was huge. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And then you went up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and upstairs were the <span class="interior space">living quarters</span> -- the <span class="interior

Eva. </sentence><sentence id="2038">Kostenits parents. </sentence><sentence id="2039">And the other <span class="interior space">room</span> was for us three girls. </sentence><sentence id="2040">And it also had a very long <span class="interior space">veranda</span> out front. </sentence><sentence id="2041">The length of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2042">Of course, also it had <span class="building">bars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2043"><span class="interior space">Downstairs</span>, <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2044">The only <span class="spatial object">bar</span> that wasn't on was in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> because they felt I guess there wasn't much to steal in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2045">So anyway so we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="2047">There was just no way of rescuing it. </sentence><sentence id="2048">My mother's soap became like soap suds. </sentence><sentence id="2049">There was hardly anything left of that. </sentence><sentence id="2050">But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we were able to use them. </sentence><sentence id="2051">But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for two people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as well. </sentence><sentence id="2052">But what happened is which made us

a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me. </sentence><sentence id="2055">And I woke up and I yelled. </sentence><sentence id="2056">A boy wants to kiss me. </sentence><sentence id="2057">I like I said my imagination, I have very vivid imagination. </sentence><sentence id="2058">At this time, by that time I was 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="2059">My birthday was in July and you know time passes on. </sentence><sentence id="2060">so this was July and I was 12. </sentence><sentence id="2061">And but back to this robber. </sentence><sentence id="2062">He was taking a check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="2063">I don't remember now. </sentence><sentence id="2064">It was my sister or the other gal. </sentence><sentence id="2065">both were named Eva so I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2066">And so this lady next <span class="dlf">door</span> in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream. </sentence><sentence id="2067">You just, go back to sleep, go back to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2068">I said no he's creeping out now. </sentence><sentence id="2069">He's leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2070">He's leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2071">Catch him, somebody stop him. </sentence><sentence id="2072">You know. </sentence><sentence id="2073">And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that something was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2074">So my mom got up and of course she saw the <span class="dlf">window</span> to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> wide open. </sentence><sentence id="2075">The <span class="dlf">door</span> to the, from the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> going down was wide open, things scattered all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2076">And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night. </sentence><sentence id="2077"><span class="spatial object">Wedding ring</span> and all. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Well that was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2079">The <span class="spatial object">wedding ring</span> was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2080">The watch was gone and that he was very upset about. </sentence><sentence id="2081">And then we had some eau de

</sentence><sentence id="2084">They thought that was the real thing. </sentence><sentence id="2085">So what over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things. </sentence><sentence id="2086">You know robberies. </sentence><sentence id="2087">So he took quite a few things with him. </sentence><sentence id="2088">He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those he took. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Oh a few odds and ends, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="2090">At this time I don't' even remember what all the man did take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents" <span class="interior space">room</span> and they didn't even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2091">If he hadn't touched me I might not have woke up. </sentence><sentence id="2092">But he made the mistake of touching me. </sentence><sentence id="2093">With that I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take them out. </sentence><sentence id="2095">I would not have felt it. </sentence><sentence id="2096">And the necklace the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2097">He, they do it in one, one This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="2101">Not, I mean not get to it. </sentence><sentence id="2102">Then we called, I guess I didn't call, we didn't call the police. </sentence><sentence id="2103">We had no <span class="spatial object">phone</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="2104">Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next <span class="dlf">door</span> that lived there came over and asked what went on and we told them. </sentence><sentence id="2105">And so I see this Filipino man coming up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span> and I'm yelling. </sentence><sentence id="2106">I said "that's him, that's him". </sentence><sentence id="2107">At night it you know this is night time we're talking about. </sentence><sentence id="2108">He had on white t-shirt and white shorts. </sentence><sentence id="2109">So did this man that was creeping out of the <span class="interior space">room</span> that had touched me and he too had. </sentence><sentence id="2110">So I said "that's him, that's him". </sentence><sentence id="2111">And they kept saying "no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="2112">No, he's our <span class="building">houseboy</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2113">I said "that's the man, I saw him." </sentence><sentence id="2114">But of course it wasn't him. </sentence><sentence id="2115">But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was afraid to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2116">They had to look under the <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, they had to look everywhere before I would even go to <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2117">I mean I was just so afraid of everything. </sentence><sentence id="2118">By then and to this day, I am still. </sentence><sentence id="2119">I mean this wasn't the only robbery. </sentence><sentence id="2120">I'll get to that later. </sentence><sentence id="2121">But to this very day I don't trust anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2122">When I had a dog in <span class="country">America</span>, I was fine. </sentence><sentence id="2123">We lost our dog. </sentence><sentence id="2124">Now I have <span class="building">ADT</span> which is a

</sentence><sentence id="2127">But me, I am from the <span class="country">Philippines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2129">Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery. </sentence><sentence id="2130">The very first one. </sentence><sentence id="2131">Then these people moved out and they moved across to the next <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And then we took another family in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my

went, enrolled as we had to go to <span class="building">school</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="2136">I mean we can't do without <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2137">So my parents enrolled us into a <span class="building">parochial school</span> run by the German nuns. </sentence><sentence id="2138">They figured because German nuns would be helpful in

</sentence><sentence id="2341">Now back to our moving around to the <span class="building">Santa Escolastica school</span> and going to <span class="building">classes</span> over there. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And the boy that had, we had to leave the <span class="building">school</span> because this little boy that was in <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, he apparently had either stomped on the picture of Jesus or spit on it or both. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I'm not exactly sure. </sentence><sentence id="2344">But the Mother Superior told my mother that she has to take us out of <span class="building">school</span> because we cannot expect, she said "we cannot expect Jewish children to come and study at the <span class="building">Catholic school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2345">We wouldn't go to your <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2346">So my mother said "well we don't have a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2347">There are just a handful of Jewish children here." </sentence><sentence id="2348">She said, "Well then it's time you opened one up." </sentence><sentence id="2349">And with that my mother was so upset that she said "yes, ok". </sentence><sentence id="2350">So all of the kids that were in that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2351">There weren't all that many. </sentence><sentence id="2352">But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2353">But while I was in <span class="building">classes</span> over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English was the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just would laugh and that would really embarrass me. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And then another thing that happened is there are so many cats over there and somehow, I didn't know yet. </sentence><sentence id="2355">I learned later on that you had to be very careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that horrible smell on you and the whole <span class="building">class</span> would smell badly. </sentence><sentence id="2356">And somebody would say "hm, I smell something horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2357">Margie, did you step into something." </sentence><sentence id="2358">And you know what, I really was the one that did it. </sentence><sentence id="2359">So they'd send me out of the <span

very ugly experiences over in <span class="populated place">Santa Escolastica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2365">So when they told us we had to leave I really wasn't all that sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2366">To me, that was kind of a new page in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2367">I was going on from this bad experience with the German sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2368">So we moved, this was <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> where we were living in that big <span class="building">house</span> and that where we shared with so many people.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2417">Q: You weren't in <span class="populated place">Intramuros</span> anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Is <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> a suburb of <span class="populated place">Manila</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2421">A: Yeah, by the way yeah, <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> is a suburb of <span class="populated place">Manila</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2422">And <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> had also the <span class="building">Jewish committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2423">I think they were located either very close to it or I'm not sure exactly where. </sentence><sentence id="2424">But they told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job. </sentence><sentence id="2425">It'll come, it'll come and my dad said "yeah but I don't' want to use everything up. </sentence><sentence id="2426">We'll have nothing to live on anymore." </sentence><sentence id="2427">And they said "oh, it's all right. </sentence><sentence id="2428">You'll find work. </sentence><sentence id="2429">You'll find." </sentence><sentence id="2430">So it was over a year later that my dad finally did. </sentence><sentence id="2431">But not until we moved to <span class="populated place">Ermita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2432">But I do want to say one more thing what happened to me while we were living in <span class="populated place">Pasay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2433">We had this one lady that had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2434">And she asked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins. </sentence><sentence id="2435">So my mother said yeah she should go. </sentence><sentence id="2436">So she gave me some one and she said "why don't you go to the <span class="building">market</span>, over" which was not all that far away. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And she said "go and get me a box of sanitary napkins". </sentence><sentence id="2438">And I went ahead and I was about 12 years old at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And I went over there and I said "I want a box of sanitary napkins". </sentence><sentence id="2440">And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And I says "Of course," I said "it's a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are done". </sentence><sentence id="2442">Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn't understand why they are laughing. </sentence><sentence id="2443">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2444">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2445"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Margie Rosenthal 43 To me it was a very serious matter. </sentence><sentence id="2446">So when I went <span class="building">home</span> I told my mother, I said "you know they were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2447">All I said is well it's something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner and you wipe your mouth and to be you know. </sentence><sentence id="2448">Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin. </sentence><sentence id="2449">And they roared, they absolutely roared." </sentence><sentence id="2450">And she said "oh my goodness". </sentence><sentence id="2451">She said you don't know really, do you?" </sentence><sentence id="2452">I said "what should I know". </sentence><sentence id="2453">And she said "Well that's when you get your period." </sentence><sentence id="2454">Well I was so embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="2455">From that moment on, when I had to go to the <span class="building">market</span> I went across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2456">I passed them so I wouldn't have to look at them or go near them. </sentence><sentence id="2457">It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2458">It was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="2459">Anyway, from like I said from <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> we did finally move to <span class="populated place">Ermita</span> because first of all there were no jobs to be had over where we were living in <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> and there was a nice <span class="building">school</span> with American nuns and I think really that was the main reason that my parents moved to <span class="populated place">Ermita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2460">There were many other <span class="populated place">suburbs</span> they could have gone to, <span class="populated place">suburbs</span> of <span class="populated place">Manila</span> that they could have gone to. </sentence><sentence id="2461">But that so we went over to meet the sisters of Maryknoll. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And they were so wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2463">They opened their arms, took us in. </sentence><sentence id="2464">We had to pay which we did too at <span class="populated place">Santa Escolastica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2465">Nothing is for free. </sentence><sentence id="2466">We even had to buy uniforms at <span class="building">Santa Escolastica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2467">And now we had to buy uniforms again in <span class="populated place">Maryknoll</span>, at or <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2468">But <span class="building">Maryknoll college</span> uniform was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="2469">It was a wine red full skirt with bib like. </sentence><sentence id="2470">And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red ribbon around the collar which was very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="2471">It was kind of a pleated top and down to the waist and then again pleat from the waist down. </sentence><sentence id="2472">And we really loved the sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2473">It was so wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had to do in <span class="populated place">Santa Escolastica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2475">We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2476">If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the <span class="building">class</span> and just listen. </sentence><sentence id="2477">Well I thought that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2478">It is not the primary source, and it has not been

44 was very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of Jesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have. </sentence><sentence id="2480">And then it came. </sentence><sentence id="2481">Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was in fifth grade at <span class="building">Santa Escolastica</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="2483">So I was in the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And they had a test, an examination at the end of the <span class="building">school</span> year and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it. </sentence><sentence id="2485">I said sure. </sentence><sentence id="2486">What have I to lose. </sentence><sentence id="2487">I mean after all you know I'm not supposed to be here but I'll take it. </sentence><sentence id="2488">And believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the Catholics did. </sentence><sentence id="2489">And the sisters told it all over the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2490">Can you imagine. </sentence><sentence id="2491">We have a Jewish girl and she got a 98% whereas you kids don't even get anything. </sentence><sentence id="2492">You are barely passing. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And so I was really thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="2494">And then came the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="2495">And again I was on the honor roll and again I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll. </sentence><sentence id="2496">I was number one which made me very happy. </sentence><sentence id="2497">And it pleased them immensely. </sentence><sentence id="2498">Then we graduated from the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="2499">Well that is a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="2500">The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the children and you had to have special uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2501">White dress and I, well my mother really couldn't afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already graduated and I could fit into her dress. </sentence><sentence id="2502">And that's what happened and I had to go forward and kiss the ring. </sentence><sentence id="2503">I pretended to kiss it. </sentence><sentence id="2504">I didn't really kiss, I didn't think it was sanitary enough to kiss the <span class="spatial object">ring</span>, but I did and from then on I went to <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2505">And in the first year of <span class="building">high school</span>, I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language. </sentence><sentence id="2506">And then the war broke out.

were able to continue receiving mail after that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2735">A: Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating

because we had hoped that they could stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="2747">And as fate would have it. </sentence><sentence id="2748">they went to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> and that's the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman could go. </sentence><sentence id="2749">So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way. </sentence><sentence id="2750">And she died in <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span> at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody wanted to really talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2751">And thinking now about the going back to the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2752">I'm trying to remember in sequence how things were going. </sentence><sentence id="2753">In <span

around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="2759">If they weren't there at 8:00 that day they would not bomb. </sentence><sentence id="2760">SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I think it was like February when they finally decided to invade us. </sentence><sentence id="2761">And my dad was working like I say on the <span class="dlf">docks</span> and they're bombing all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2762">And then the Americans had to set fire to all of the <span class="spatial object">ships</span>" cargo and everything that was on the <span class="dlf">docks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2763">They didn't want to leave anything to the Japanese of course. </sentence><sentence id="2764">So the people were told, take whatever you can

make several trips go for it. </sentence><sentence id="2769">So people would pass our <span class="building">house</span> with, carrying things like clothing and just materials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes because potatoes did not grow in <span class="populated place">Manila</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2770">They had to be imported.

groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could possibly use. </sentence><sentence id="2782">One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation. </sentence><sentence

and inside was a <span class="spatial object">coffin</span> with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going next to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="2792">Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his resting place. </sentence><sentence id="2793">And then the fire was going a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2794">I mean it was all around.

class="building">Sunday school</span> and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we weren't' rich or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2852">We couldn't take things out of their <span class="country">country</span> so we were, had to start fresh, completely fresh as I've said before. </sentence><sentence id="2853">There was not a whole lot left that we could rescue or salvage. </sentence><sentence id="2854">We did keep that <span class="spatial object">wooden box</span> that all our stuff came in. </sentence><sentence id="2855">And my mother had packed away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, the four of us were in one <span class="interior space">room</span> and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2856">Like I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother and already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream. </sentence><sentence id="2857">I mean there, the food thing on a popsicle. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Oh that was quite a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="2859">We never were able to buy a Coke because those were expensive. </sentence><sentence id="2860">Even five centavos we couldn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2861">We had to save every penny to send to <span class="populated place">Shanghai</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2862">And for the visa for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="2863">So we were really considered quite poor in those days. </sentence><sentence id="2864">So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few <span class="spatial object">furnitures</span> of course, and all the people, the Americans had left. </sentence><sentence id="2865">Now the Japanese were marching in. </sentence><sentence id="2866">We heard them coming in during the night. </sentence><sentence id="2867">And it was an awful feeling to hear marching. </sentence><sentence id="2868">It reminded us of the Nazis in <span

just kill us all. </sentence><sentence id="2871">We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from people in different <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2872">They were very sadistic. </sentence><sentence id="2873">And the first troops in were mostly Koreans. </sentence><sentence id="2874">They had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the Koreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually smell them through the <span class="dlf">windows</span> into the <span

know. </sentence><sentence id="2877">Because they were in the war. </sentence><sentence id="2878">I mean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace. </sentence><sentence id="2879">But it was very, very hard for us to all of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="2880">We didn't know what awaited us. </sentence><sentence id="2881">How they This is a

which as an <span class="populated place">internment camp</span> for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected of being pro-American. </sentence><sentence id="2885">So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the Americans and so in a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away. </sentence><sentence id="2886">Not, they were still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because they, a lot of them were in <span class="populated place">Bataan</span> and they didn't' have a lot of communications with

of October 1996. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2947">This is the third tape of this interview, the first side. </sentence><sentence id="2948">And Margie and I were just talking about their life style, the family's life style before the Japanese took over and afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2949">A: Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the <span class="building">market</span> and buy beef and you know better things. </sentence><sentence id="2950">However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported. </sentence><sentence id="2951">Once the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food. </sentence><sentence id="2952">We did not have any regular potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="2953">We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say. </sentence><sentence id="2954">And we didn't have much money. </sentence><sentence id="2955">In fact money was like going always up, up, up. </sentence><sentence id="2956">It was like inflation. </sentence><sentence id="2957">Money wasn't worth a thing and so we ate rice. </sentence><sentence id="2958">One meal would be the rice soup. </sentence><sentence id="2959">Another meal would be the rice. </sentence><sentence id="2960">Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one would be the regular sweet potato. </sentence><sentence id="2961">But my mother became inventive. </sentence><sentence id="2962">She would take for example she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar on it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness. </sentence><sentence id="2963">And it was a little bit like a potato salad, were trying to imitate that. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2965">So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?) </sentence><sentence id="2966">with the coconut and then squeeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into <span class="spatial object">cube trays</span> in the <span class="spatial object">freezer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2967">And we would have ice cream. </sentence><sentence id="2968">I mean you had to be very inventive. </sentence><sentence id="2969">You could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2970">And later on in the things, I mean flour disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2971">We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour. </sentence><sentence id="2972">We bought bread This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2973">It is not the primary source, and

Margie Rosenthal 54 out of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo. </sentence><sentence id="2975">We had no matzo of course so we used sour flour for matzo. </sentence><sentence id="2976">Things were really pretty rotten. </sentence><sentence id="2977">And the beef came to an end as well because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese confiscated a lot of the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2978">So all of a sudden we were having horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="2979">But we didn't know it was. </sentence><sentence id="2980">It tasted different. </sentence><sentence id="2981">Our Dad finally told us because he was in <span class="country">Russia</span> before the war if you remember. </sentence><sentence id="2982">He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat. </sentence><sentence id="2983">Well then we didn't want to eat that any more either. </sentence><sentence id="2984">So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy. </sentence><sentence id="2985">We couldn't hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we're going to raise our own and well where do you keep a chicken, right. </sentence><sentence id="2986">There was no, you can't leave it outside. </sentence><sentence id="2987">It might get stolen so we put chickens in one of the little <span class="interior space">rooms</span> like a <span class="interior space">closet</span> and had a <span class="building">bar</span> across it and they would roost right on top of the <span class="building">bars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2988">But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2989">You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching. </sentence><sentence id="2990">And we would jump out of <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens because like I said they liked to eat chickens too. </sentence><sentence id="2991">Then during the winter season we lived in a place where we were <span class="interior space">downstairs</span> and across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from us was the <span class="building">house</span> of Japanese where they were torturing Filipinos. </sentence><sentence id="2992">Whoever they thought was a group that was against them. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And they would do the most horrible things to them. </sentence><sentence id="2994">And we would see walking by. </sentence><sentence id="2995">It was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="2996">They would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have them close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="2997">And they would just absolutely and they'd blow up like they would swell up. </sentence><sentence id="2998">It was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="2999">Or they would pull fingernails out and toenails and the water torture. </sentence><sentence id="3000">They did everything and anything to get some information out of them. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And that they didn't do, they couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="3002">And my dad at that time, there was no more. </sentence><sentence id="3003">In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile

needed to get some money. </sentence><sentence id="3006">So we would buy parts from one place and take it and sell it to another place. </sentence><sentence id="3007">One of our, my good customers was the <span class="building">cigar company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3008"><span class="building">Hamber</span>, I think it was called <span class="building">cigar company</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And they would give me what they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="3010">They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs. </sentence><sentence id="3011">X number of <span class="spatial object">fan belts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3012">I mean things like that or even batteries. </sentence><sentence id="3013">So I would go and find where I could find some and then bring it to them and sell them. </sentence><sentence id="3014">Now I was having a better time of sales than my dad, I guess because I was a girl. </sentence><sentence id="3015">Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family some money somehow. </sentence><sentence id="3016">And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3091">A: Well we still were in <span class="populated place">Ermita</span> and the <span class="spatial object">auto parts</span>, people tipped us off who might be wanting to sell. </sentence><sentence id="3092">Well you had no gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="3093">You only had <span class="spatial object">cars</span> there so you dismantled them and sold part by part because nobody could drive a <span class="spatial object">car</span> at that point anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3094">Gasoline was out of the question so you had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that and so I went and procured it and sold it to them. </sentence><sentence id="3095">And we'd separate, my dad and I.

old man. </sentence><sentence id="3167">He was so broken up about this that we said you're not going back into that again ever, ever. </sentence><sentence id="3168">You cannot do it. </sentence><sentence id="3169">And so my poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3170">We thought it was somebody going to break in again. </sentence><sentence id="3171">And no, it was one of the people that had said they're going to check up on him were outside our <span class="dlf">window</span>, looking in. </sentence><sentence id="3172">But barely. </sentence><sentence id="3173">You had to just kind of look in through the slats. </sentence><sentence id="3174">But they were there checking up on us. </sentence><sentence id="3175">That was the last time he went into the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3176">We would not let him. </sentence><sentence id="3177">I said we'd rather starve. </sentence><sentence id="3178">Now we, like I said, we were at the <span class="interior space">floor level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3179">In the back was <span class="env feature">swamp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3180">And they had fish so we would go out there and try to catch some fish for food. </sentence><sentence id="3181">And we had those two chickens. </sentence><sentence id="3182">But you know we didn't have heart. </sentence><sentence id="3183">We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says here. </sentence><sentence id="3184">You take them. </sentence><sentence id="3185">We don't want to eat them. </sentence><sentence id="3186">And they're getting older. </sentence><sentence id="3187">You better just use them. </sentence><sentence id="3188">Of course they didn't' give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities something awful. </sentence><sentence id="3189">And many people didn't make it back. </sentence><sentence id="3190">I mean even some of our Jewish people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="3191">They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn't find

</sentence><sentence id="3200">Little like a, it was like you see in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3201">You know those little <span class="building">guard

right. </sentence><sentence id="3203">And so we learned to do it. </sentence><sentence id="3204">But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="3205">We are German. </sentence><sentence id="3206">They don't' know the difference so we said <span class="populated place">Allemande</span>, <span class="populated place">Allemande</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="3211">They bowed to us. </sentence><sentence id="3212">But they were like I said pretty viscous. </sentence><sentence id="3213">And again things became, the <span class="env

came loose. </sentence><sentence id="3216">And we, whenever we put our feet out ora hand out, it would touch <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3217">So we know the <span

</sentence><sentence id="3219">High up. </sentence><sentence id="3220">Everything was up high. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And that's how so we could open the, we had <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3254">Q: I think you talked about the fact that the Japanese placed their <span class="spatial object">munitions</span> near some, in <span class="populated place">suburban neighborhoods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3255">And I'm wondering if that was true in <span class="populated place">Pasay</span> as well as <span class="populated place">Ermita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3256">If that was just a general practice of the Japanese. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3260">A: It certainly was. </sentence><sentence id="3261">From <span class="populated place">Pasay</span>, we moved back to <span class="populated

place">Ermita</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="3272">It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved back to <span class="populated place">Ermita</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3273">I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45. </sentence><sentence id="3274">And the bombings of the Americans increased. </sentence><sentence id="3275">Then came shelling. </sentence><sentence id="3276">They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling us that they had already come to the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Manila</span> by dropping leaflets. </sentence><sentence id="3277">So we knew the end was near. </sentence><sentence id="3278">We could just hold out a little bit longer. </sentence><sentence id="3279">And we had ok, also we, up until that time we were able to go to the <span class="building">temple</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3280">And we were able to go every week to services. </sentence><sentence id="3281">But when the <span class="spatial object">shell</span>, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be outside. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3282">And there was no place to really hide because there were no <span class="building">air raid shelters</span> in <span class="populated place">Manila</span> because it was too low. </sentence><sentence id="3283">It was water underneath, not far down, we had water. </sentence><sentence id="3284">So we couldn't build any <span class="building">air shelters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3285">So you had to hope for the best. </sentence><sentence id="3286">That was about it. </sentence><sentence id="3287">So then we were again back in <span class="populated place">Ermita</span> and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because they knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the civilians. </sentence><sentence id="3288">So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in- between the civilians, like maybe two <span class="building">houses</span> of civilian. </sentence><sentence id="3289">The third one would have that. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Or five <span class="building">houses</span> of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3291">So they were all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="3292">And we knew more or less where they were. </sentence><sentence id="3293">So we but we, where else can you run. </sentence><sentence id="3294">I mean you can't keep running so we were at one place. </sentence><sentence id="3295">It used to be a dressmaker's place. </sentence><sentence id="3296">That was our very last <span class="dlf">stand</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3297">We were so tired of moving and running away and no matter where we went we were getting bombed or getting shelled. </sentence><sentence id="3298">It really

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3305">A: Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out. </sentence><sentence id="3306">So this one lady was baking pies and I took it to the <span class="building">hospital</span> where they still had some doctors and nurses. </sentence><sentence id="3307">And also the people that were discharged from the <span class="building">prisons</span> were there. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And there was one Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered. </sentence><sentence id="3309">Because I had known him. </sentence><sentence id="3310">His name was Moser. </sentence><sentence id="3311">And he was laying on the <span class="spatial

what you see nowadays with the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> victims. </sentence><sentence id="3313">Exactly that's what he looked like. </sentence><sentence id="3314">They starved him, they beat him. </sentence><sentence id="3315">They did everything you can possibly imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3316">He could barely talk to us. </sentence><sentence id="3317">And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt that was the only thing I could do. </sentence><sentence id="3318">I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady that made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little pieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn't really show much emotion at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3319">He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything. </sentence><sentence id="3320">And the pies like I said you know I sold as long as I could. </sentence><sentence id="3321">And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe and more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in <span class="populated

he beat him up. </sentence><sentence id="3352">I mean L, after a while I actually felt sorry for this guy. </sentence><sentence id="3353">Not only did he beat him. </sentence><sentence id="3354">He knocked him to the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and then he kicked him. </sentence><sentence id="3355">And he was still apologizing. </sentence><sentence id="3356">This, this police, I mean this solider was apologizing to this, to this officer. </sentence><sentence id="3357">Anyway it was very lucky for me. </sentence><sentence id="3358">It was really it was very, one of the fortunate instances. </sentence><sentence id="3359">Well then this all was coming to an end. </sentence><sentence id="3360">The Japanese were making, going from <span class="building">house</span> to <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3460">A: We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same place. </sentence><sentence id="3461">I mean we were side by side we'd go

point. </sentence><sentence id="3480">It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3481">By the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="3482">And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and the ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don't want to go up in flames and be thrown to smithereens. </sentence><sentence id="3483">We just might as well leave while we still can. </sentence><sentence id="3484">So that morning we gathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for <span

was 17 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="3490">and so my sister she was, what 12. </sentence><sentence id="3491">So I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3492">Maybe they gave her something to carry also. </sentence><sentence id="3493">And on top of that we had again bought some chickens. </sentence><sentence id="3494">Raw, live chickens. </sentence><sentence id="3495">And they were making such a racket. </sentence><sentence id="3496">So we gave it to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And said we don't' want to be, we can't kill them anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3498">Just take them, just go. </sentence><sentence id="3499">So we gave them to somebody who I don't even know who they were. </sentence><sentence id="3500">And we went to this <span class="building">apartment

</sentence><sentence id="3515">It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3516">It pushed me underneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel. </sentence><sentence id="3517">Our dog ran away at that time and we were looking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken our dog was barking at all the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3518">We didn't know how to keep her quiet. </sentence><sentence id="3519">So when this explosion happened, she took off which was probably a
