<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3">Thank you, thank you, I'm really glad to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: (Let's just start by you telling me your name, and when you were born, and where, and give me a little family picture.) </sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in really a <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> that is now <span class="populated place">Harlem</span> -- I was born on <span class="dlf">120" Street</span>, March 27, 1914. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter, because my father wrote a photoplay -- it was on a suffragist subject. </sentence><sentence id="8">My mother was a suffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called "What Every Woman Wants" -- I think it was called. </sentence><sentence id="9">And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. </sentence><sentence id="10">And he told me it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse -- I've always loved that name -- who delivered me, at <span class="building">home</span>, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say. </sentence><sentence id="11">My father was one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="17">What else? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="25">But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. </sentence><sentence id="26">And become his own film company producer. </sentence><sentence id="27">So we went out to <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span> very early. </sentence><sentence id="28">I really remember the ride on that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was on the old Chief, <span class="building">Santa Fe Chief</span>, before the <span class="building">Superchief</span>, even. </sentence><sentence id="30">And I vaguely remember that, being out on the <span class="spatial object">observation car</span>, and watching the <span class="country">country</span> fall away behind us. </sentence><sentence id="31">My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third "M" at <span class="building">MGM</span> - the two of them together set up a very early <span class="building">film studio</span>, way <span class="populated place">downtown</span>, not in what we call <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span> now, but down by the <span class="dlf">railroad tracks</span>, way downtown <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">It was called the <span class="building">Mayer-Schulberg studio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">So both <span class="populated place">Mayer</span> and <span class="building">BP</span>, so they both were making these early silent films. </sentence><sentence id="34">That's about it. </sentence><sentence id="35">My father's big discovery was <span class="populated place">Clara Bow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">He found her in a <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span> beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">I called Clara sort of a pre- Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. </sentence><sentence id="38">She was known as the, as the "It" girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called "It." </sentence><sentence id="39">And she had it. </sentence><sentence id="40"><span class="populated place">Clara</span> really did have It. </sentence><sentence id="41">She really did. </sentence><sentence id="42">She's still amazing to watch in those silent films. </sentence><sentence id="43">And that's so -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="44">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="45"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection My father and Louis made their films for a few years, for about three or four years, and then Louis Mayer went to the newly formed <span class="building">MGM</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">And at that point my father went over, went back to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the <span class="region">west coast</span> studio of <span class="building">Paramount</span>. </sentence><sentence id="47">And so, all through my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the <span class="interior space">backlot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="48">I used to go there almost every day on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, drove through those famous <span class="dlf">gates</span>, and roam around and play on the <span class="interior space">backlot sets</span>, and wander into different <span class="interior space">stages</span> where they were shooting amazing films. </sentence><sentence id="49">So all these famous stars were like old hat to us -- they were more like people who just worked for my father -- was the way we thought of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: (How early did you get interested in writing?) </sentence><sentence id="78">Very, very early, I'd say I was about 9 or 10, very early. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was very much a part of our household atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="83">My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. </sentence><sentence id="84">And he, also as a kid, worked on the old <span class="building">Daily Mail</span> and a short time on the old World -- papers that we, that we dearly miss. </sentence><sentence id="85">There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we're down to about two and a half. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my mother was a frustrated librarian. </sentence><sentence id="88">And she set up a very big <span class="building">library</span>, thousands of books, all set up like a regular <span class="building">library</span>, all numbered like a <span class="building">library</span>, a real <span class="building">library</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">My father used to -- Sunday morning was a ritual. </sentence><sentence id="90">He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. </sentence><sentence id="91">It's amazing what we read. </sentence><sentence id="92">We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that. </sentence><sentence id="93">So writing was very much part of our life. </sentence><sentence id="94">So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="95">So by the time I went to <span class="building">high school</span>, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession. </sentence><sentence id="96">And it all went -- it fell in place very naturally. </sentence><sentence id="97">I edited the <span class="building">high school</span> -- <span class="building">Los Angeles High School</span> daily paper. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had a daily paper. </sentence><sentence id="99">I laugh because these days, my kids at <span class="building">Westhampton High School</span> couldn't get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn't imagine putting it out every day. </sentence><sentence id="100">But we did. </sentence><sentence id="101">So anyway, that's why, so we breathed that <span class="env feature">atmosphere</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that <span class="building">Scribners</span> published, entitled, They Cried a Little. </sentence><sentence id="103">Sonya said that in our <span class="building">house</span>, where in other <span class="building">homes</span> they might have a <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and people might sit down -- Sonya said, in our <span class="building">house</span>, we had a <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span>, and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="207">Well, 19 -, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="208">When I got out of <span class="building">college</span> in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father's assistant, had now set up his own <span class="building">studio</span>, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born -- which was the daddy of all those later <span class="building">Star is Borns</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="209"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="210">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="211"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="212"> And, let's see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter. </sentence><sentence id="213">And I had a seven-year contract -- it started at 50 and went to 75 a week. </sentence><sentence id="214">At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500. </sentence><sentence id="215">And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don't think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">And then they would call us in -- I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the <span class="spatial object">bench</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner and me -- we were a writing team. </sentence><sentence id="218">We were both about 21, 22 years old. </sentence><sentence id="219">We were just out of <span class="building">college</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="220">And he would call us in on --like on A Star is Born. </sentence><sentence id="221">They couldn't figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of <span class="populated place">Grauman</span>'s Chinese and sees her husband's footprints and handprints, and when she's asked her name. </sentence><sentence id="222">She's now a big movie star, and he's gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn't stand his failure while she's gone up. </sentence><sentence id="223">And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, "This is Mrs. Norman Maine." -- </sentence><sentence id="224">and it's a big ending in the movie. </sentence><sentence id="225">Things like that, little bits and pieces. </sentence><sentence id="226">It wasn't awfully satisfying. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">By the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David -- I'd known him so well for years and years -- my mother even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged them. </sentence><sentence id="228">And I'd known him since I was a kid, and I said, "David, do me a big favor, please, don't pick up my option." </sentence><sentence id="229">And David was really very hurt. </sentence><sentence id="230">He said -- he felt really insulted, and he said, "Well, I have great plans for you. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work...." You could see this going on until the 21* century -- a dynasty of the Selznicks and the <span class="building">Schulbergs</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="232">And I said, "Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you." </sentence><sentence id="233">And David said, he said, "Well," he said, " I know we carry you on the <span class="spatial object">payroll</span> as a writer" -- and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that's exactly what he said -- he said, "I know we carry you on the <span class="spatial object">payroll</span> as a writer, but," he said, "I figure that sooner or later your producer's blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in." </sentence><sentence id="234">I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. </sentence><sentence id="235">It's in <span class="building">The Last Tycoon</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="236">So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="237">I started writing short stories for <span class="building">Liberty</span> and <span class="building">Colliers</span> and for all the slick magazines. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I was doing very well with that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? </sentence><sentence id="240">And I then decided that I'd like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="242">Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) -- (PAUSE) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: (Let's start that sentence again.) </sentence><sentence id="244">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. </sentence><sentence id="247">We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters" Guild and the Anti-Nazi League -- all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program. </sentence><sentence id="248">So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to -- I'd like to stop and write this book. </sentence><sentence id="249">The answer was, "I guess you'll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that" -- Lawson was the head of the communist party -- "to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments." </sentence><sentence id="250">So I went to see <span class="building">Lawson</span>, and <span class="building">Lawson</span> was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed. </sentence><sentence id="251">And Jack said, "Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'1l sort of supervise the writing of the book." </sentence><sentence id="252">And I said, "Jesus, Jack, I can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="253">And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party. </sentence><sentence id="254">And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it. </sentence><sentence id="255">And they said, "No, you have to do it, or if you...." Finally, one day I went <span class="building">home</span> with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, "Jigee, I can't take the argument any more. </sentence><sentence id="256">It's just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and drive away and just leave. </sentence><sentence id="257">And even that was, even that -- people don't realize how tightly disciplined the party was. </sentence><sentence id="258">You couldn't just get in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and drive away. </sentence><sentence id="259">If you were going to <span class="populated place">New York</span> you had to tell them where you were going. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a <span class="building">unit</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was very tightly controlled. </sentence><sentence id="262">So I just -- the very act of getting in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline. </sentence><sentence id="263">And when I got back to, I went back to <span class="populated place">Dartmouth</span>, where I'd gone to <span class="building">college</span>, and found a little <span class="building">house</span>, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. </sentence><sentence id="264">And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy. </sentence><sentence id="265">Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it's just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also. </sentence><sentence id="267">Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own. </sentence><sentence id="269">But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People's World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name -- he wrote a rave review of the book. </sentence><sentence id="270">He thought the book was the <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span> book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about -- raved about it. </sentence><sentence id="271">That caused a firestorm apparently. </sentence><sentence id="272">They called him in and they gave him hell -- Lawson and company. </sentence><sentence id="273">Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, "On further consideration" -- and he even said, "It's been pointed out to me the shortcomings," and he absolutely trashed the book. </sentence><sentence id="274">Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn't, if he didn't do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. </sentence><sentence id="275">He had to do it, and so he just trashed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="276">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="277"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the book. </sentence><sentence id="278">It was a terrible book. </sentence><sentence id="279">It didn't do that and it didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="280">It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) </sentence><sentence id="323">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="324">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. </sentence><sentence id="325">He was just ina rage. </sentence><sentence id="326">When I came in, he screamed at me. </sentence><sentence id="327">It was almost like that Judge Freisler. </sentence><sentence id="328">And he screamed at me. " </sentence><sentence id="329">You're a traitor! </sentence><sentence id="330">You're a traitor!" </sentence><sentence id="331">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. " </sentence><sentence id="332">How could you write that terrible book?!" </sentence><sentence id="333">he screamed at me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: (Why don't you tell me how Stuart was brought into the <span class="building">unit</span> and when that was?) </sentence><sentence id="870">Well, Stuart joined the <span class="building">Marine Corps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="871">And after his Marine training -- the same tough stuff -- even tougher maybe that he went through -- he was assigned to a <span class="building">film unit</span>, a <span class="building">film unit</span> in the Marine Corps. </sentence><sentence id="872">Meantime, I heard that we'd a <span class="dlf">slot</span> open in our outfit. </sentence><sentence id="873">Someone had dropped out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="879">I forget what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="880">Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart, I said he was really very, very able. </sentence><sentence id="881">And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford approved it, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="882">And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us. </sentence><sentence id="883">And that's how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial preparation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="911">What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and made several films that were, I think, quite effective. </sentence><sentence id="912">But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial. </sentence><sentence id="913">For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence. </sentence><sentence id="914">But we never saw George Stevens. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I don't think I'll ever be able to disconnect it. </sentence><sentence id="916">It comes up constantly. </sentence><sentence id="917">It's right there, if you find it-- George Stevens worked on this. </sentence><sentence id="918">It's one of the many, many troubles with the <span class="spatial object">Internet</span>, that's really a big negative for me. </sentence><sentence id="919">I get asked questions about <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span>, about, did I get back to <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span> work because I testified to the committee after the war, and I didn't go anywhere near <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="920">I still felt outlawed, understand. </sentence><sentence id="921">And I lived in, in <span class="populated place">Bucks County</span>, <span class="region">Pennsylvania</span>, and just wrote books. </sentence><sentence id="922">But all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever. </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="956">Drinks) He called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the <span class="building">building</span> of an international trial. </sentence><sentence id="957">And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford -- Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. </sentence><sentence id="958">So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial. </sentence><sentence id="959">And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="960">I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main <span class="country">U.S.</span> prosecutor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="970">I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson. </sentence><sentence id="971">Anyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic -- it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial. </sentence><sentence id="972">As a result of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. </sentence><sentence id="973">And so, so I... Then I went back to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and -- with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. </sentence><sentence id="974">So, he set up in, I think in <span class="populated place">Wiesbaden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="975">And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler's official photographer. </sentence><sentence id="976">And Hoffmann, who -- oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the <span class="building">Hitlerjugend</span>. </sentence><sentence id="977">It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law. </sentence><sentence id="978">But as I point out -- with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point. </sentence><sentence id="979">I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. </sentence><sentence id="980">We would say that the -- feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the <span class="country">country</span> really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="981">You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="982">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="983"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 those rallies. </sentence><sentence id="984">And we said that we thought of the Germans as being either, either at your throat or, or at your feet. </sentence><sentence id="985">That's what we said. </sentence><sentence id="986">And at that point, we found them willing -- that even formerly Nazi people would do anything that you, anything that you wanted, because they were scared of us also. </sentence><sentence id="987">But by then we were the conquerors and they were scared about what we might do to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1008">Q: (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?) </sentence><sentence id="1009">Hoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of photographs to Stuart. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1023">There was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the <span class="populated place">Jackson</span> staff -- he was on <span class="populated place">Jackson</span>'s staff, well we all were really, we were officially on <span class="populated place">Jackson</span>'s staff too -- would work out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back up those indictments photographically. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the <span class="populated place">Vineyard</span> -- a very distinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and sometimes I was down there frequently. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I was in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when we were preparing the film. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1155">And for each one I would sit down with Donovan, sometimes with Ray Kellogg in attendance also -- Ray served as sort of an intermediary between Donovan and me -- and Donovan would spell out, out for us what the indictments were, show us, in fact I would read them, and then ask us, "How do you think that you see <span class="building">film building</span> or buttressing the case that we're making?" </sentence><sentence id="1156">So, so I would go away with that information and then, then look for film that would answer his, his, what he was looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1157">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1161">Q: (Where did you look first?) </sentence><sentence id="1162">Stupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time -- at that time it was like August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15" of September. </sentence><sentence id="1163">We had no time. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So we got, so as a shortcut, we thought we'd look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually that was produced, had come from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn't answer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And so I, I went down with a list. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1665"> Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.[Sound problem -- Boom mike was missing. ] </sentence><sentence id="1667">Well, the -- of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl's master film of the Nazi party day -- I think it was the seventh -- called the Triumph of the Will. </sentence><sentence id="1668">It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. </sentence><sentence id="1669">The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work. </sentence><sentence id="1670">It was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1671">The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption. </sentence><sentence id="1672">It was shown all over <span class="country">Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the <span class="region">Rhineland</span>, and the <span class="region">Sudetenland</span>, and on and on they went, one little step at a time. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, "How can we possibly defeat that power?" </sentence><sentence id="1675">It was overwhelming, just overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="1676">I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions. </sentence><sentence id="1677">It was a powerful piece of propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And so, it was, it didn't take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. </sentence><sentence id="1679">She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports. </sentence><sentence id="1680">She was very closely tied in with the whole <span class="building">Nazi propaganda machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and they directed to me to some place in <span class="populated place">Strasbourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And I went there, and then I went to <span class="populated place">Kitzbiihl</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1684">And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living -- sort of hiding in the open, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1685">It wasn't exactly hiding but she wasn't advertising either, what her address was. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And so I was able to actually, with a <span class="spatial object">weapons carrier</span> and an army driver, I was able to go to her <span class="building">house</span> and literally just knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1687">She was living in a very nice place -- it was a big, big,

</sentence><sentence id="1689">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1690">I just knocked on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and somebody came to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1691">And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1692">And I said, "I would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl." </sentence><sentence id="1693">And they let me in. </sentence><sentence id="1694">It was a little man, said he would call her. </sentence><sentence id="1695">So I sat down, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

almost half an hour, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1700">She took a very long time coming. </sentence><sentence id="1701">I think she was making up. </sentence><sentence id="1702">After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker -- big star in <span class="country">Germany</span> --all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And she finally came, and I sat with her on a <span class="spatial object">couch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And she started right away working on me. </sentence><sentence id="1705">She said, of course, "I'm a film artist, and internationally respected." </sentence><sentence id="1706">And she gave a very positive rundown on herself. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And she said, "I'm respected everywhere in <span class="populated place">London</span>, in <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span>, and so forth, and I'm not a Nazi, I'm a pure film artist." </sentence><sentence id="1708">That was her own <span class="dlf">party line</span> and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And, and when she told me how well received she was in <span

place">Hollywood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1711">She just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And she told me that, after all, even in
