<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A:I was born in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> in 1914. </sentence><sentence id="36">My parents both came here from <span class="country">Latvia</span> and <span class="country">Russia</span> at the age of two and three many, many years ago. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I went to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> in <span class="building">public schools</span>: <span class="building">grammar school</span>, <span class="building">junior high school</span>, <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q:Which part of <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A:I was born on the <span class="region">West side</span> of <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> and my family gradually moved to the <span class="region">North side</span> so that by the time I went to <span class="building">college</span>, we were living in <span class="populated place">Wilmette</span>, just North of the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>. </sentence><sentence id="44">I went to the <span class="building">University of Michigan</span>, which is a nice <span class="building">state school</span>, it had a regular reputation This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="45">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="46"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and was just a sufficient distance away from <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> so I could get away from the family a little bit, but I could also get back -- by hitchhiking -- back, and get a meal when I needed one. </sentence><sentence id="47">And then I went on from <span class="building">University of Michigan</span> to the <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span> where I got my regular degree, Magna Cum Laude, and then I stayed on for an additional year and got an L.L.M. at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter(ph). </sentence><sentence id="48">I thereafter went down to the <span class="building">Circuit Court of Appeals</span> in <span class="populated place">New York City</span> and clerked for the person I consider to be one of the better judges, one of the best judges, really, in the <span class="country">United States</span>, Augustus N. Hand, not Learned Hand who was his cousin who was on the same <span class="building">court</span>, but Gus Hand. </sentence><sentence id="49">I stayed with him for a year and then came down to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">In <span class="populated place">Washington</span>, the thesis was -- my thesis was -- that I was going to get a job, which I did get with the <span class="building">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> in the <span class="building">Reorganization Division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">The reason for the <span class="building">Reorganization Division</span> being that it was the factor in the SEC which handled litigated cases, corporate reorganization cases, and I wanted to go back to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> and practice law with my two older brothers in the field of corporate reorganization, which had been occupying a great deal of their time. </sentence><sentence id="52">I never got back to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> because I left the <span class="spatial object">SEC</span> [<span class="spatial object">phone</span> rings] should I stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q:Back to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Well, I never got back to <span class="populated place">Chicago</span> because I moved from the <span class="building">SEC</span> to one of the wartime agencies, the office of <span class="building">Price Administration</span> here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we were just beginning to get into the war. </sentence><sentence id="68">And then from the office of <span class="building">Price Administration</span>, more by chance than anything else, I moved over to the <span class="building">State Department</span> in March of 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q:Before we go to the <span class="building">State Department</span>, could I ask you about your, is your family Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A:My family is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="74">I was raised in the Reform aspect of the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="75">I took Hebrew lessons which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about, and, I'm a reasonably non- conforming Jew. </sentence><sentence id="76">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="77">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="78"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q:And during the early days of National Socialism, you were in <span class="building">college</span> and <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">Were you actively aware of what was happening, and was it something that was a major part of your view of the world at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, I wasn't tremendously aware of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="90">I was... I read the newspapers all the time and so I knew approximately what was going on, as much as one can gain from the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="91">I still remember being in <span class="building">college</span> when Mr. Hitler came to power in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and I remember talking about that with a history professor who curiously, whose name I curiously enough still remember, Mr. Slossun(ph), his name was. </sentence><sentence id="92">A very distinguished professor, a very interesting professor. </sentence><sentence id="93">He said, "Hitler will last a few months, that's all." </sentence><sentence id="94">That was in 1933, when I was still in <span class="building">college</span>, and I was aware of what was going on quite clearly. </sentence><sentence id="95">When I went to the <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span> which was in 1935, I saw a lot of people there and, as a matter of fact, I've, a group of other people and I got together and organized - - with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs(ph), who is a professor at the business <span class="building">school</span> -- he came over to my little <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that I was sharing with a couple of other characters, and sort of gave us lessons in the Talmud, supposedly every Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="96">It lasted about three Saturdays and that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="97">But, so far as what was going on in <span class="country">Germany</span> was concerned, yes I was aware of it but I wasn't deeply involved in anything particular. </sentence><sentence id="98">I do remember being at a <span class="building">Harvard Law Review</span> dinner one time and talking with one of the professors who was resentful about the fact that longshoremen in <span class="populated place">New York</span> had been trying to prevent the unloading of goods from <span class="country">Germany</span>, and he thought this was an unwarranted interference by a private organization in the affairs of the United States Government. </sentence><sentence id="99">I disagreed rather strongly with him at the time but didn't take a tremendous amount of act, I did not take an active role, really, in anything going on. </sentence><sentence id="100">I had a little bit to do, not very much, with refugee matters. </sentence><sentence id="101">Partially because one of the people who eventually became my partner, and who was a year or two after me in <span class="building">law school</span>, was very much involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I probably contributed a little bit to some organizations but I didn't do very much more than that. </sentence><sentence id="103">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="104">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="105"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q:You mentioned that it was sort of by chance that you went to the <span class="building">State Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Can you describe a little bit more about that chance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A:Yes, I can. </sentence><sentence id="128">As I said, I've spent a large amount of time in the Reorganization Division of the <span class="building">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> when I first came down here to <span class="populated place">Washington</span>. </sentence><sentence id="129">And eventually in 1943, in early "43, a friend of mine, Bernard Melser(ph), who's still a Professor of Law, Emeritus, at the <span class="building">University of Chicago</span>, called me. </sentence><sentence id="130">He was temporarily in the <span class="building">State Department</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">He was a very bright young man and he was about to go over to <span class="country">Europe</span>, I think he was in on the Nuremberg Trials, but he was in the <span class="building">State Department</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="132">And he called me, and he said there was a very interesting thing going on there, and why didn't I come over to the <span class="building">State Department</span> and organize or work on something called the Reorganization Program in the <span class="building">Foreign Funds Control Division</span> of the Department of State. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, "Bernie, that has absolutely nothing to do with corporate reorganization under Chapter 10 of the <span class="building">Bank</span>," -- well, Chapter 10 didn't exist, but <span class="building">77B</span> did -- "under the Bankruptcy Act at all. </sentence><sentence id="134">It's absolutely different." </sentence><sentence id="135">And he said, "Well, you know that and I know that, but nobody else knows that and you're the only person around who knows something about quote, "reorganization." </sentence><sentence id="136">Reorganization is reorganization is reorganization." </sentence><sentence id="137">So, I thought it was a very interesting kind of thing, and went over to the <span class="building">State Department</span>, and basically I was the fellow who was in charge of the program, which there was one, and trying to run the Germans out of enterprises, primarily in <span class="region">Latin America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">The reorganization program there was one which took into account the fact that a large number of business enterprises in <span class="region">Latin America</span>, in particular, had been founded by <span class="building">German enterprises</span>, <span class="building">Farben</span>! </sentence><sentence id="139">and a variety of others. </sentence><sentence id="140">And the worry was that these <span class="building">enterprises</span> would contribute to the Nazi war effort in at least two ways. </sentence><sentence id="141">One was by contributing of funds to a variety of very evil causes; and the other was by contributing and financing espionage, or sabotage, or "DS Barbers Arges Geena Chemical Cartel. </sentence><sentence id="142">Assets of this Cartel were cloaked by a Swiss holding company called "<span class="building">Interhandel</span>" after the war. ( </sentence><sentence id="143">Source: Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking. </sentence><sentence id="144"><span class="populated place">New York</span>: <span class="building">Viking</span>, 1982.) </sentence><sentence id="145">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection worse. </sentence><sentence id="148">And the idea was, you had to allow the Latin Americans to continue to have the benefits of these organizations, many of which were in the medical and drug, pharmaceutical field. </sentence><sentence id="149">You couldn't just close down the organizations, so you had to continue to have the organizations do what they had been doing: producing drugs. </sentence><sentence id="150">But you wanted to get the German influence out of those, and that was the reorganization aspect: trying to introduce, primarily at that time, <span class="building">American enterprise</span> to come in and take over these <span class="building">enterprises</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">Certainly during the period of the war, and probably thereafter, because we always had the theory that we didn't want the Germans to come back again in <span class="region">Latin America</span>, particularly in view of the fact that the National Socialist philosophy was one that was anathema to most of us here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q:Was that reorganization separate from the <span class="building">Safe Haven</span> Program? </sentence><sentence id="182">Or was that part of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A:The <span class="building">Safe Haven</span> Program developed out of the Reorganization thing, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="186">I was one of the originators of this, so called, Safe Haven Program. </sentence><sentence id="187">But that had the same kind of objective at it that the Reorganization Program did. </sentence><sentence id="188">Reorganization was supposed to: a) take care of the present threat -- try to get the German control away from these <span class="building">enterprises</span> in <span class="region">Latin American</span> so they couldn't contribute money; and secondly, the idea was to prevent any recurrence of the German influence in <span class="region">Latin America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">That, basically, was the Safe Haven Program, prevention of recurrence of Nazism, and fascism, and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q:But <span class="building">Safe Haven</span> was an international effort, not just an American effort, is that, can you describe more about <span class="building">Safe Haven</span> and its beginnings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A:Well, <span class="populated place">Safe Haven</span> was basically, my recollection is, it was basically an American initiative but we certainly had the British involved in it from the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="198">And it may have been international in the broader sense of the word, because I'm sure, as what resulted, as a fact of the later days, the French got involved very heavily. </sentence><sentence id="199">But basically, at the beginning, the British and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a British-American effort, basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one could equate with Nazi influence at the time, and to try to get rid of that, not only at the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="200">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="201"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection present time, but for, to prevent any recurrence of it. </sentence><sentence id="202">That was basically the <span class="building">Safe Haven Program</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">What we were trying to do is locate <span class="region">areas</span> where the Germans had located money, where Germans were cloaking or having somebody else cloak for them etcetera, etcetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q:And, specifically, what did you, what was your role in that effort? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A:Well, I was trying to devise policies with respect, particularly in the beginning, with the Latin Americans to try to persuade the Latin Americans, for example, to control the <span class="building">German enterprises</span>, German owned enterprises in their <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">But, my first trip was down to <span class="country">Columbia</span> and my effort down there was to try to persuade the Columbian government to either supervise or actually vest the assets belonging to <span class="building">German controlled enterprises</span> and then to have those administered in accordance with this reorganization program by Allies, by Americans, probably, because the Americans were the only ones really able to do this kind of thing but we would have said the British or the Dutch or anybody else, if there were people like that around as well. </sentence><sentence id="217">But there weren't very many around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q:So it was actually an effort to try and move American management in to take control of the corporation, is that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="223"> <span class="dlf">ArYes</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q:...what you were doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="228">Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="229">Because the idea was, you were, as I say, had two objectives. </sentence><sentence id="230">One was a wartime objective, to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of the German war effort and the second was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea, part of the idea that you didn't want the German, Germans as they were then certainly, to come back in to any kind of political power in other <span class="region">areas of the world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="231">We had some problems here in the <span class="country">United States</span>, as you probably know, with... we also had a lot of problems with the possibility of Germans infiltrating into the <span class="building">enterprises</span>, particularly into the <span class="building">enterprises</span> where they had been prominent in <span class="country">countries</span> like <span class="country">Bolivia</span>, <span class="country">Columbia</span>, <span class="country">Argentina</span>, etcetera, in <span class="region">Latin America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">That was the <span class="region">part of the world</span> that I was very much involved with. </sentence><sentence id="233">The entire <span class="building">enterprise</span> had some people from, for example, one of my good friends, Kovi(ph) Oliver, who is still This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="234">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="235"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection around, a very distinguished, now former, ambassador of the <span class="country">United States</span> to <span class="country">Colombia</span> many years after this, was stationed in <span class="populated place">Madrid</span>. </sentence><sentence id="236">A good many of the people who were involved in this when I got into it, were Americans who spoke good Spanish because <span class="region">Latin America</span> was one of the <span class="region">areas</span> of our concentration. </sentence><sentence id="237">We would find a lot of the people involved in this were people who had been born in <span class="populated place">El Paso</span>, as Kovi(ph) was, or in some place in <span class="region">Texas</span> who spoke Spanish as well as they did English, or nearly as well. </sentence><sentence id="238">Kovi probably spoke it better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q:And that was 1943 when you went to the <span class="building">State Department</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A:1943 was when I came into it. </sentence><sentence id="256">The effort had been going on for awhile before that. </sentence><sentence id="257">I came into this Division of <span class="building">Foreign Funds Control</span>, which was basically trying to look at the financial transactions of people who might be supporting the Axis, and what we were trying to do was to prevent any financial transactions which would have been of benefit to them. </sentence><sentence id="258">There were a variety of aspects of that. </sentence><sentence id="259">One was to blacklist <span class="building">companies</span>, either in the <span class="country">United States</span> or elsewhere, primarily elsewhere, because we had direct control over the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="260">But we were trying to blacklist <span class="building">companies</span>, mainly from the neutral countries who were doing business with the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q:Can you mention what some of those <span class="building">companies</span> are, were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A:They were, we were, we had a blacklist which was maintained in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, <span class="country">Sweden</span>, <span class="country">Spain</span>, <span class="country">Portugal</span>, <span class="country">Argentina</span>, <span class="country">Columbia</span>, <span class="country">Turkey</span>, a variety of other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="270">Basically, wherever we thought, what we could do would be to prevent a financial transaction which would have been beneficial to the... to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were active in trying to say-- to the <span class="building">enterprises</span>, mainly, or to individuals, but mainly these would be enterprises, individuals acting as enterprises, as well-- we were trying to say to them, "If you do this, you're not going to have any access, whatsoever, to any <span class="building">American facilities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">And we will not only prevent you now from dealing with the <span class="country">United States</span>, selling to the <span class="country">United States</span> or getting exports from the <span class="country">United States</span>, but we will continue this effort after the war in order to prevent you from rebuilding the thing." </sentence><sentence id="273">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="274">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="275"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q:Could you mention some of the <span class="building">enterprises</span> that we're dealing with, some of the <span class="building">German enterprises</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A:Well, the, <span class="building">Sterling Drug</span> was one of the enterprises; <span class="building">IG Farben</span>", of course, is the largest one. </sentence><sentence id="286">There were a whole slew of <span class="building">corporations</span> in <span class="country">Sweden</span> which had been manufacturing ball bearings for other machine parts and things like that, who were all on the blacklist. </sentence><sentence id="287">My recollection does not go to the individual names very much. </sentence><sentence id="288">We had a few Americans on the blacklist, some American nationals living in <span class="populated place">Vichy France</span>... <span class="country">France</span> were suspected of dealing with the Germans, and we blacklisted American nationals. </sentence><sentence id="289">That raised some issues here but we did it nonetheless. </sentence><sentence id="290">But, one of the real reasons for the negotiations with the Swiss in 1946 was the fact that the blacklist still existed and there were a number of Swiss corporations which were still on the blacklist and they were obviously desirous of getting them off the blacklist. </sentence><sentence id="291">We were desirous of restoring normal relations, too. </sentence><sentence id="292">But the principal motive for the negotiations on the <span class="region">Swiss side</span>, was to eliminate the blacklist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q:I want to lay as much groundwork for the Swiss negotiations as possible. </sentence><sentence id="302">So we're now at "43, "44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="305">You have come to the <span class="building">State Department</span> and you're sort of gradually becoming part of the Safe Haven Program, is this right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A:Yes, except not gradually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q:Not gradually. </sentence><sentence id="309">It didn't happen gradually. </sentence></p></dialogue>

with really discussing it in any, even remote way, was in connection with Mr. Bower's book, The Paperclip Conspiracy, indicated that I was one of the people in the <span class="building">State

when I was clerk for Gus Hand, and back in those days, there was a guy named Fritz Coon(ph) who was around, who was a well-known American Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="403">In any case, Wilcox and I got into a dispute which was reflected in a couple of memos back and forth in which Clare(ph) basically said he was just as anti-Nazi as I was but he didn't think that this was the... it was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="437">A:Well, I'll go back even before the Paris Agreement. </sentence><sentence id="438">The Pottsdam(ph) Agreement, signed, basically, the assets in the neutral countries of German nationals, to the Western Allies with respect to reparation purposes. </sentence><sentence id="439">So that the theory was that we would take, the... we'd get reparations from the Germans, and not only from <span class="country">Germany</span> itself, the <span class="region">occupied areas</span>, but also from the <span class="region">areas</span> where Germans had interests in the <span class="country">neutral countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="440">And the Paris Agreement decided on how those assets, how all of the reparations to be taken from <span class="country">Germany</span>, would be divided up among all of the Western Allies. </sentence><sentence id="441">Because the only people present, the only countries present at the <span class="populated place">Pottsdam</span> Agreement, were the <span class="country">United States</span>, <span class="country">Great Britain</span>, and the <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">So, <span class="populated place">Paris</span> had to do something about allocating the proceeds, allocating the amounts that would be given to the various <span class="country">Allied countries</span>, whether they happened to be <span class="country">Belgium</span>, <span class="country">Holland</span>, or the <span class="country">United States</span>, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="443">The Paris Agreement also worked out a formula -- because even then we were concerned about refugees and the people who were left homeless, the persecutees and so forth -- had worked out an agreement that a portion of what was recovered would be allocated to what was then the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, and through the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees primarily it was decided -- I'm not sure if this was in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> or a little bit later -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="444">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="445"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 to the <span class="building">Jewish Agency</span>" and the Joint Distribution Committee.deg [phone ringing] The <span class="spatial object">machine</span> will pick that up, I hope. </sentence><sentence id="446">In any case, the Paris Agreement was one in which we were allocating the proceeds of the reparations which were scheduled to come from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="447">Now, part of those proceeds, obviously, were the assets of German, of the German entities, and German individuals located in the <span class="region">neutral countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="448">And that laid the background for the negotiations with the Swiss and then later with the Swedes and the Spanish and the Portuguese and, even to a certain limited extent, with the Turks. </sentence><sentence id="449">Because we knew there were a lot of German assets located in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A:Okay, looted gold, I'll get back to that. </sentence><sentence id="772">There, you have to make a distinction with respect to the question of looted gold. </sentence><sentence id="773">The main body of looted gold that we were talking about back in those days when we started negotiating with the Swiss and with the others, the Portuguese as well, was the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of the <span class="building">Central Bank depositories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="774">You have to know that the large amount of gold that was on deposit in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, was moved to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, and maybe down to Dakar(ph) and re-smelted and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="775">But that was Belgian government <span class="building">Central Bank</span> gold. </sentence><sentence id="776">And what we were then making sure of, trying to make sure of basically, was that the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of every <span class="building">Central Bank depository</span>, which was basically where gold was kept, was restituted at the end and that's the gold which we have, basically, gotten back. </sentence><sentence id="777">To the extent of about 60 or 70 or maybe even 80 percent of it. </sentence><sentence id="778">That is the gold which, basically, has been distributed by the <span class="building">International Gold Commission</span>, a tripartite commission on gold, which is more or less affiliated with the institutions in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, and which as been restored, a part of which This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="779">It is not the

collection 2 has been restored even fairly recently, to the Albanians, who lost gold from their <span class="building">central depositories</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="781">That is one aspect. </sentence><sentence id="782">That's the major part of the, quote, the "looted gold" that went to <span class="country">Germany</span> and which was used by the Germans for their own purposes. </sentence><sentence id="783">The second part of the looted gold, was the gold which was taken out of the teeth of <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> victims, the gold bracelets that came off the wrists of women, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="784">And in that particular category of quote, "looted gold," unquote, we generally included looted gold and other assets because, in that same general category, we're talking about paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="785">All the valuables, the personal valuables that people would have. </sentence><sentence id="786">Now, a certain amount of that, going back strictly to the gold, was looted by the gold... looted by the Germans, and melted down by them, and used by them for their own wartime purposes. </sentence><sentence id="787">I hesitate a little bit when I say "wartime purposes," because I am reasonably convinced without having any particular proof of it, that a substantial amount of that went into the pockets of the individuals, the individual Germans who were there in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, the guards, etcetera, etcetera, the people who had control of it, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="788">The Germans were pretty good at keeping track of things like this because they didn't want the guards to be profiting instead of the authorities back in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, but I'm sure that, since in almost every other case there's been some individual looting, there probably would have been a considerable amount of individual looting in this particular case. </sentence><sentence id="789">So, some of that, though, may have disappeared into the pockets of the guards, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="790">But a large amount of that gold went back to <span class="building">smelting establishments</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> and was smelted down. </sentence><sentence id="791">And then, probably, having been smelted, had the Reichsbank stamps put on it. </sentence><sentence id="792">And, all in all, probability, the Reichsbank stamps dated back five or ten years or something like that so that it looked just like gold that had been in the <span class="building">Reichsbank Central Bank depositories</span> for years. </sentence><sentence id="793">Now, the Swiss knew at the beginning of the war, approximately how much gold reserves the <span class="building">German central bank</span> did have. </sentence><sentence id="794">And they know that during the course of the war, more gold went through <span class="country">Switzerland</span> than was in those <span class="building">depositories</span> at the beginning.

part of that gold had to be looted in one sense or the other. </sentence><sentence id="798">In the sense of having come from the <span class="building">central bank depositories</span> of the, what should have been Belgian gold, or Albanian gold, or French gold or something like that, <span class="building">Central Bank</span> gold, and on the other side, gold that came out of the <span

class="building">homes</span> were looted. </sentence><sentence id="799">So, that gold has been a substantial part of the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="800">The question of what actually happened with respect to the gold that passed through <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, or came into <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, is, I think, one that maybe Mr. Volcker" and others will be able to find out more clearly about. </sentence><sentence id="801">A large part of that gold, I think, was just transferred back, transferred by the Germans, converted into Swiss francs, and the Swiss francs were used by the Germans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase, war materials in the first place, or something else. </sentence><sentence id="802">Some of that gold probably remained in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="803">How much remained in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="804">I don't, I doubt that very much of it did remain in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, because I think it had all been used, to the extent that it possibly could be used. </sentence><sentence id="805">We did work out an agreement with the Swiss in which they would make a payment on account of looted gold to the International, the <span class="building">Tripartite Gold Commission</span>. </sentence><sentence id="806">And a payment of that sort was made. </sentence><sentence id="807">Beyond that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="808">How much of this gold can be identified as having come from the people who were in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and how much their claims, therefore, should be, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="809">I notice in the newspapers, there was some complaint about the fact that the amount of money that's still in the <span class="building">Federal Reserve</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission, some payments were being made to governments, like the Albanian government, rather than to individuals. </sentence><sentence id="810">Since the governments got back less than, a lot less than 100% of what was looted from them, I'm not sure that that's a legitimate complaint.
