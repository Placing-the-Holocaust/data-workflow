" </sentence><sentence id="2670">OK." </sentence><sentence id="2671">So we got those baskets and brought on the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>; and then our people called the representatives of the religious group - there were some rabbis among them - some people who knew how to...to...to cut the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2672">Said, "Look, we got about a few hundred chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2673">Organize yourselves and get them all...cut them in the proper way. </sentence><sentence id="2674">Then cook them, and that will be your food for the next couple of weeks." " </sentence><sentence id="2675">OK." </sentence><sentence id="2676">We can, what do you want now. </sentence><sentence id="2677">I don't know how they organized. </sentence><sentence id="2678">It was like a <span class="dlf">conveyor rail line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2679">There was men on this side. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Three of them were cutting. </sentence><sentence id="2681">Then they were sending them down. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And, you know, according to the Jewish law you're not allowed to scald the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2683">You had to flick them. </sentence><sentence id="2684">You see, at the end, there were six women or so; and they were flicking them. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And...and then the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>...at six o'clock in the evening, the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was on its way with our next  4 stop <span class="country">South Africa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2686">And all of a sudden, all these feathers started going up in the <span class="env feature">air</span>, into the <span class="interior space">funnel</span> of the <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="2687">Laughter) Where the classy (ph) captain - was a Greek captain - he took a uh one of those megaphones, and he said, "I give you ten minutes to get that stuff cleaned up, or I'll send my people with the hose--water hoses--and everything will go overboard." </sentence><sentence id="2688">So somebody ran to him, and explained to him what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2689">He said OK, I'll give you a half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="2690">Within a half an hour everything was OK, and they had food.
