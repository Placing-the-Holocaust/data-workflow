<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="247">The idea of using the <span class="building">synagogue</span> shorter and living in this <span class="populated place">town</span>, which was -- had quite a Jewish population, the idea was that we had to obey these laws. </sentence><sentence id="248">And we knew very well that if we don't obey it will be something bad. </sentence><sentence id="249">But we knew it that they who didn't obey these laws, they have also 25. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was called . </sentence><sentence id="251">Those that they changed, it means 25. </sentence><sentence id="252">And this you will suffer yourself. </sentence><sentence id="253">And they, especially the Jews, didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="254">But not many got beaten 25 times on their behind. </sentence><sentence id="255">So it was an example for the whole population. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="273">They were used to live with the Jews because without the Jews it's no fun. </sentence><sentence id="274">But they needed the Jews for handing out 25. </sentence><sentence id="275">And they knew it right away, who would get it? </sentence><sentence id="276">The Jew. </sentence><sentence id="277">This was very clear for them that it was so. </sentence><sentence id="278">But when -- until 1918, 1920, and then they moderated us so that they have quite let loose this law. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Why did they moderate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Why? </sentence><sentence id="289">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="290">Life became, all of the sudden, easier for the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: They were friends which were not Jewish and which I appreciate very much because they like to play soccer with me, because I was a very good goalkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="311">And therefore, I became their equal. </sentence><sentence id="312">They even didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="313">The younger boys didn't know what to do with anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="314">They were told, "Hate the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="315">So they thought, "Yes, I hate the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="316">But that was all that they did. </sentence><sentence id="317">But there were no beating up Jews, boys to boys, because we were on the same team, the football team. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: So, who were the kids that -- that made anti-Jewish comments to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Anti-Jewish comments were very few. </sentence><sentence id="329">There were the Romanian that choose to shit in your hat and tell the mother this is good. </sentence><sentence id="330">They made a rhyme and had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: But didn't you say that other kids would -- would beat you and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Oh, no, that was after 1920. </sentence><sentence id="337">Yes, after 1920 they were running after us because they were told that they could beat us up and nothing would happen to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: So is there anything else that you can think of that really changed when <span class="country">Romania</span> took over, for you and your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="343">It was very clear it had to do with our so-called profession; watchmaker. </sentence><sentence id="344">One bought the watch and said, "I don't know what to do, my watch goes and all of the sudden doesn't go. </sentence><sentence id="345">Then I shake it, it goes. </sentence><sentence id="346">Then I don't shake it, it doesn't go. </sentence><sentence id="347">So I have to shake it all the time and I cannot go shaking my watch all over the time. </sentence><sentence id="348">So therefore, it's a dirty Jew sold me this <span class="spatial object">watch</span> and he knew it wasn't good." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: Were there any other laws that pertained? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: So you studied throughout <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: All of the time. </sentence><sentence id="429">Because the <span class="building">school system</span> there is from 8 to 12. </sentence><sentence id="430">And 8 to 12 you learn the violin. </sentence><sentence id="431">After 12 you go <span class="building">home</span> and you have the lesson. </sentence><sentence id="432">And -- and this was very pleasant because it's only four hours. </sentence><sentence id="433">So it was all right. </sentence><sentence id="434">Sure you learned other disciplines like arithmetic and what you have to learn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: You were taking the <span class="spatial object">violin</span> in addition to your -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="768">Oh, they attacked." </sentence><sentence id="769">And all of the sudden you can see soldiers in German uniform lying dead. </sentence><sentence id="770">And people who look closer saw the image of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, Jews dressed in uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="796">Q: I'm getting confused. </sentence><sentence id="797">Where are we now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: We are in <span class="populated place">Gleiwitz</span>, where they started the war. </sentence><sentence id="801">And they said, "German soldiers were killed by Polish soldiers and look what happened." </sentence><sentence id="802">And there was not true, not a word. </sentence><sentence id="803">So here the war started. </sentence><sentence id="804">But it is very interesting that we here in <span class="country">America</span> don't talk very much about this, possibly not. </sentence><sentence id="805">Because this is not a story I tell you, this is printed in the papers and you can read it. </sentence><sentence id="806">But then the other thing, which was really tragic, here comes Hitler to Stalin and said, "Stalin, we have to be friends." </sentence><sentence id="807">And Stalin said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="808">I'm the biggest fascist and you're the biggest communist. </sentence><sentence id="809">How can we be friends?" " </sentence><sentence id="810">Look, I have to start the war against <span class="country">Poland</span> and if you don't help me as a good friend, then the whole thing is for not." </sentence><sentence id="811">So they became good friends and Stalin helped Hitler two full years. </sentence><sentence id="812">Send him <span class="spatial object">armorment</span>, send him food. </sentence><sentence id="813">And so Hitler could take all the <span class="country">countries</span> like <span class="country">Poland</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> -- which he took before, but never mind. </sentence><sentence id="814">In the war he took them now. </sentence><sentence id="815">And then he could take <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Belgium</span> and all these <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="816">And Stalin send him armorment and food and so on because the agreement was signed on the 23rd of August 1939. </sentence><sentence id="817">And the 1st of September 1939, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="818">Who started the war? </sentence><sentence id="819">Stalin started the war. </sentence><sentence id="820">People here said Hitler started the war. </sentence><sentence id="821">This is stupidity because they don't want to read in the <span class="building">library</span>, the agreement between Stalin and Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="822">Exactly eight days after they signed the contract. </sentence><sentence id="823">a bargain between the two foreign ministers. </sentence><sentence id="824">Eight days afterwards, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="825">So now who started the war? </sentence><sentence id="826">Stalin because he said, "Okay, yeah, my friend. </sentence><sentence id="827">Now we  2 have to be friendly." </sentence><sentence id="828">And the <span class="dlf">railroad line</span> that we went on the <span class="country">Russia</span> now, going through was <span class="populated place">Chernivtsi</span> was blocked. </sentence><sentence id="829">It couldn't be used anymore because it was only for armorment for <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="830">No passenger, no <span class="spatial object">freight trains</span>, nothing went, only this for armorment for <span class="country">Russia</span> -- for <span class="country">Germany</span> -- <span class="country">Russia</span> send it to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="831">Now what -- why are we today still afraid? </sentence><sentence id="832">But it's not a story I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="833">It's a story you can read in the <span class="building">library</span>. </sentence><sentence id="834">And so therefore, I hope that people will get their mind straight and see the broader history is here. </sentence><sentence id="835">Otherwise, they are afraid to do anything and this is false. </sentence></p></dialogue>
