<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="12">My cousin Stephen was born in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company. </sentence><sentence id="15">Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years. </sentence><sentence id="16">I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life. </sentence><sentence id="17">She still managed to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">She was in <span class="country">America</span> and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early "60's. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War. </sentence><sentence id="21">She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her. </sentence><sentence id="22">I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh . </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh I did visit these grandparents in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> several times. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm not quite sure how often and they came to visit <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> but uh that grandfather also died very early, in March of 1936. </sentence><sentence id="25">So I don't have too much of a recollection except that I do remember him. </sentence><sentence id="26">a very stern man, very religious man, very learned man as a matter of fact in both the working and religious category. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Well, mine was really very good. </sentence><sentence id="46">Uh I have a very recollections of being a little bit spoiled, being that I'm the only grandchild or was the only grandchild until uh I was five years old. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="47">Uh I was taken to many places. </sentence><sentence id="48">My parents took me to uh <span class="dlf">parks</span>, <span class="building">theaters</span>, etc. </sentence><sentence id="49">We lived ina very lovely <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">I had wonderful toys, and with the uh birth of my cousin who of course almost became like a brother figure to me since I was an only child, uh life was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="51">I spent an awful lot of time, many hours with my aunt and unale, and as a matter of fact, the relationship uh with that aunt and uncle and my other aunt, and I will mention their names. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="52"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="53">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="54"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="55"> Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children. </sentence><sentence id="56">have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have. </sentence><sentence id="57">Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave <span class="country">Germany</span> which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="58">They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left <span class="country">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938. </sentence><sentence id="59">She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now <span class="building">school</span> started for me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="61">And I entered <span class="building">school</span>, the school year of 1937, <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> uh called at one time <span class="building">School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">Rather famous for it's <span class="building">girls school</span> of uh high but by the time I went to the <span class="building">school</span> it was no longer called . </sentence><sentence id="63">I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the <span class="building">Jewish community</span> uh <span class="building">center</span>, <span class="building">community council</span> or whatever it was called in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> when Jewish children no longer could attend <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I went to this <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">The <span class="building">school</span> was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called <span class="building">Hebrew day school</span>, a half-day uh singular subject and half-days. </sentence><sentence id="66">Unfortunately I only went to that <span class="building">school</span> for about a year and a half before we left <span class="country">Germany</span> but the year and a half I was there were very happy years. </sentence><sentence id="67">I remember my some of the girls that went to <span class="building">school</span> and in particular the daughters of my parents" friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="68">Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children. </sentence><sentence id="69">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="70">Two daughters and one son. </sentence><sentence id="71">One of the daughters, . </sentence><sentence id="72">The Meyers immigrated with us to <span class="country">Albania</span> and the Millers went to <span class="country">America</span> and , but when I came to <span class="country">America</span> after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the <span class="env feature">clouds</span> over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh in particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously UhI spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="74">Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our <span class="building">home</span> and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="76">And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than. </sentence><sentence id="77">Uh and as I say, I think that the first <span class="env feature">clouds</span> that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our <span class="interior space">classroom</span> and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> uh please leave the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">Your parents would like you to come <span class="building">home</span>, or whatever she said. </sentence><sentence id="79">She certainly didn't say that they were going to be deported that very same day but this was the beginning of the deportation of uh Polish Jews in particular. </sentence><sentence id="80">I, perhaps it was other Jews as well, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="81">But I think it was Polish Jews primarily were sent that very day, that same evening, out of <span class="country">Germany</span> and back to the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think that the Poles didn't want them, and the Germans didn't want them. </sentence><sentence id="83">I do remember that there was a child of a SpanishPortugese family in my <span class="building">class</span>, and he was the rabbi of the uh I think, I believe the one and only <span class="building">Spanish synagogue</span> in uh all of <span class="country">Germany</span>, and she was in my <span class="interior space">classroom</span>, and I think that she also was called out. </sentence><sentence id="84">I'm not, I couldn't uh vouch for that. </sentence><sentence id="85">But children of Polish parents were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="86"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="87">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="88"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="89"> deported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="90">Obviously that left some impression on all of us children. </sentence><sentence id="91">I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children. </sentence><sentence id="92">Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="93">And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event. </sentence><sentence id="94">Like every other morning I went to <span class="building">school</span>, and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="95">I was sent to <span class="building">school</span> like every other morning, and my way to <span class="building">school</span> passed a big uh <span class="building">Synagogue</span>, the center of ,Jewish life in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">And in fact the <span class="populated place">city</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big <span class="building">synagogue</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="97">Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent <span class="spatial object">exhibits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="98">I think the place where the <span class="building">synagogue</span> stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="99">But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to <span class="building">school</span>, and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and throwing stones <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the place itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming. </sentence><sentence id="101">I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there and throwing stones into the <span class="dlf">stained glass windows</span> was enough to make us and arrived at <span class="building">school</span> and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="102">We should remain calm and we wouldn't have <span class="building">school</span> that day. </sentence><sentence id="103">And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's <span class="building">home</span> where my father already was. </sentence><sentence id="104">And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the <span class="building">synagogues</span> all through <span class="country">Germany</span> had been set on fire, destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="105">were burned in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="106">It is known that in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> sacrificed themselves to run into the <span class="building">synagogue</span> to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh that the had been demolished. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">merchandise had been thrown into the <span class="dlf">streets</span> covered with <span class="env feature">water</span> and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction. </sentence><sentence id="109">Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the <span class="region">downtown area</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">He came back . </sentence><sentence id="111">In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh <span class="building">police stations</span> and eventually ended up in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh concentration <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">I'm not sure whether <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> was already in existence but <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and were. </sentence><sentence id="113">And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="114">and he had arrived at <span class="building">work</span> and was immediately taken by the police to . </sentence><sentence id="115">We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my grandmother had a uh <span class="interior space">apartment</span> that looked out on the main <span class="dlf">street</span>, the and from the <span class="dlf">window</span> we could watch much of what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh since my grandfather had passed away in 1935 and it was known that there was no man living in her, in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and she had a very large <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which ran from one side of the <span class="dlf">street</span> to the next, uh my father, another elderly gentlemen and a friend of their family decided to spend the day uh in the <span class="interior space">back rooms</span> of this <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and indeed that day nothing really happened. </sentence><sentence id="117">No SS men or no uh secret police came to uh my grandmother's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">We didn't know of course that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="119">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="121"> this was a <span class="spatial object">pogram</span> (ph) that would last for an entire week. </sentence><sentence id="122">We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="123">And at night we did go <span class="building">home</span> uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own <span class="building">home</span> and he was not going to be intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="124">And we did go <span class="building">home</span> that evening and uh slept in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">I don't believe that too much happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="126">They may have knocked on our <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">We didn't answer uh the <span class="dlf">door</span>, but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="128">Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of <span class="populated place">town</span> and I'm not sure how they made their way, to <span class="building">summer resort</span> called . </sentence><sentence id="129">It's outside of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was the for being prepared for uh <span class="country">Palestine</span> at that time, and also a <span class="building">children's home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">In fact I spent one summer there as a child. </sentence><sentence id="132">And uh this uh was surrounded by a <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">Maybe the nights too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone that was there. </sentence><sentence id="135">My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people. </sentence><sentence id="136">All kinds of gloves for different professions. </sentence><sentence id="137">And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at <span class="building">home</span>, which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the <span class="building">Museum</span> is interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="139">And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in <span class="country">Germany</span>, across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this <span class="building">business</span> that he had built up in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in <span class="country">Germany</span>, his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh Jews were no longer allowed to . </sentence><sentence id="141">Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="142">It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as "39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="143">And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name. </sentence><sentence id="144">All women became Sarah and all men became <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter. </sentence><sentence id="146">And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name. </sentence><sentence id="147">And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the <span class="spatial object">Iron Cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">He had received in 1935 a <span class="spatial object">cross</span> which was given only to all <span class="dlf">front line</span> fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the <span class="dlf">front line</span>, and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out. </sentence><sentence id="150">I mean that was something . [ </sentence><sentence id="151">believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="152">Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet panic. </sentence><sentence id="153">To be told that they were going to go to <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> or we were being resettled in the <span class="region">east</span> and didn't know where they really were going to. . </sentence><sentence id="154">OK. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh it now became This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="156">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="157"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158"> obviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life. </sentence><sentence id="159">I'm a child. </sentence><sentence id="160">I'm panic- stricken or very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="161">The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="162">Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms . </sentence><sentence id="163">Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh <span class="building">shelter</span>, even at that stage of the game. </sentence><sentence id="164">But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out. </sentence><sentence id="165">And we had to stay in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">The sirens would go. </sentence><sentence id="167">The uh uh <span class="building">fire department</span> would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear. </sentence><sentence id="168">I mean I can feel that fear even today. </sentence><sentence id="169">I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went <span class="building">home</span> to uh back to our own <span class="interior space">apartment</span> Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken. </sentence><sentence id="170">I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean. </sentence><sentence id="171">And the tremendous fear . </sentence><sentence id="172">Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, "36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of and these would be broadcast on the <span class="building">radio stations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">And people would put on their <span class="spatial object">radios</span>, and I remember but this must have been summer time. </sentence><sentence id="174"><span class="interior space">Windows</span> were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again. </sentence><sentence id="175">I could feel it like I felt it as a child . </sentence><sentence id="176">So the feelings uh the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, I don't think that anybody every really can completely forget that kind of fear. </sentence><sentence id="177">Well the world became very insecure as I said. </sentence><sentence id="178">Uh many friends began to leave. </sentence><sentence id="179">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="building">school</span>, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and three children, and my parents trying to find a place to go. </sentence><sentence id="180">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">My two aunts by now were in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="182">They had began to send us affadivits and all the supporting affidavits and uh supporting letters and security and whatever else the <span class="building">American consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered, but because of the uh trust that my father had, and this here, I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long, and perhaps even felt, had a feeling of ... ... and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again and I could feel it like I felt it as a child of six and seven and eight. </sentence><sentence id="183">So the fear existed and the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, and I don't think that anybody ever really can completely forget that kind of a fear. </sentence><sentence id="184">Well, the world became very insecure. </sentence><sentence id="185">As I said uh many friends began to leave. </sentence><sentence id="186">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="building">school</span>, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and the three children, and my parents, were trying to find a place to go. </sentence><sentence id="187">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">My two aunts by now were in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">They had began to send us affidavits and all the supporting affidavits and and supporting letters and securities and whatever else the <span class="building">American consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered. </sentence><sentence id="190">But because of the uh trust that my father had, and this and this here I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long time, and perhaps even felt, fear, had a feeling of of un grudge against my parents for this feeling of security that they expre...that they had for living in <span class="country">Germany</span>, and I didn't understand it until recent years when I have read many stories of other people like myself who came from German families and where the feeling was exactly the same, where the attitude was the same. </sentence><sentence id="191">They were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="192">They had lived in <span class="country">Germany</span> for generations. </sentence><sentence id="193">Uh I know that my mother's family, I myself in my book have

<span class="region">Prussia</span>, uh under American law after the after the uh Ist World War it had been ceased (ph) to <span class="country">Poland</span> and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to <span class="country">America</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="198">But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German. </sentence><sentence id="199">And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the in the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place. </sentence><sentence id="201">I I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="202">But nevertheless this was the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="203">So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota. </sentence><sentence id="204">My mother and I both having been born in <span class="country">Germany</span> had not, no great problems. </sentence><sentence id="205">The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for <span class="country">America</span> several times before leaving for <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">I think we were called to the <span class="building">Consule</span> at least twice if not three times. </sentence><sentence id="207">However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier. </sentence><sentence id="208">And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead. </sentence><sentence id="209">I believe did. </sentence><sentence id="210">So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">They had to also find another <span class="building">asylum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">And it was exactly that. </sentence><sentence id="213">It was a search for an <span class="building">asylum</span> no matter where. </sentence><sentence id="214">And uh the <span class="dlf">passibilities</span> were very very slim. </sentence><sentence id="215">They thought of <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">Well <span class="country">England</span> required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">Was very difficult to get into <span class="country">Argentina</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove. </sentence><sentence id="221">He was a business man, through and through. </sentence><sentence id="222">So that was out. </sentence><sentence id="223">So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this <span class="country">Albania</span> uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to <span class="country">Germany</span> at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go ona honey...his honeymoon to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money. </sentence><sentence id="225">He got us in return, perhaps not in return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery. </sentence><sentence id="226">I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="228">At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span> back to her would have been absolute uh disaster. </sentence><sentence id="229">I mean how does anybody go into an <span class="spatial object">airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before. </sentence><sentence id="231">At any rate we did get visas. </sentence><sentence id="232">Uh and uh now the process of leaving <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> mysteriously began. </sentence><sentence id="233">My recollections on that are very very sad. </sentence><sentence id="234">Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's. </sentence><sentence id="235">Today I'm pretty close to that and I

person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like <span class="country">Albania</span> and this is all we knew about <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh she was left alone in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> with an older sister. </sentence><sentence id="241">Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to <span class="country">America</span> were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="242">I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> of course. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">That was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">We had to give up our things. </sentence><sentence id="247">We had to give our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="248">Uh and we thought that we would go to <span class="country">Albania</span>, transfer our documents with the <span class="building">American Consule</span> to the <span class="building">American Consule</span> in , which indeed we did and that we would go to <span class="country">Albania</span> for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year. </sentence><sentence id="249">Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long. </sentence><sentence id="250">Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, it was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="252">We're not allowed to take out any silver. </sentence><sentence id="253">We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="254">Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="255">We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased. </sentence><sentence id="256">I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="257">I believe that in my papers at <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Haifa</span> I even have lists of things my parents took with them. </sentence><sentence id="258">I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="259">I mean everything was made very clear. </sentence><sentence id="260">They packed a <span class="spatial object">lift</span> (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials. </sentence><sentence id="261">Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these <span class="spatial object">lifts</span> were left in the storage of the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in <span class="country">America</span> we would send for these <span class="spatial object">lifts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your <span class="spatial object">lift</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span>, and it makes sense, because I think the <span class="country">United States</span>, or the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> of <span class="populated place">New York</span> would have been flooded with <span class="spatial object">lifts</span> of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there. </sentence><sentence id="263">So our <span class="spatial object">lift</span> was left in uh <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, in the uh <span class="dlf">harbor</span> of <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, and uh we left <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="264">At least this is what the official exit document that I have states. </sentence><sentence id="265">Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc. </sentence><sentence id="266">It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him. </sentence><sentence id="267">These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war. </sentence><sentence id="268">Uh his younger brother had fallen for <span class="country">Germany</span> eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="269">Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919. </sentence><sentence id="270">She had gone to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to wait for him as he arrived. </sentence><sentence id="271">He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into <span class="country">Russia</span> and never came back from the war until February 1919. </sentence><sentence id="272">Uh she was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="273">She awaited him at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza. </sentence><sentence id="275">She went back to <span class="populated place">Posen</span> and died very shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="276">And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier. </sentence><sentence id="277"><span class="populated place">Posen</span> by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into <span class="populated place">Posen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="279"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="280">It is

that uh all whoever was left in <span class="populated place">Posen</span> of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="284">But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the <span class="building">building</span> where we lived, that he could use the <span class="interior space">furnace room</span> of the <span class="building">house</span> and burn all what he couldn't take with him. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="285">Papers, documents, etc. </sentence><sentence id="286">etc. </sentence><sentence id="287">He took some things with him, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="288">We were so limited in our <span class="spatial object">baggage</span> and our <span class="spatial object">luggage</span> that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take. </sentence><sentence id="289">Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the <span class="building">house</span> that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along. </sentence><sentence id="290">The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="291">Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us. </sentence><sentence id="292">One for each of us, and nothing more. </sentence><sentence id="293">And her jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="294">When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="295">And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along. </sentence><sentence id="296">They were pa...that is to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us. </sentence><sentence id="297">Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this place, packed in a sealed little package. </sentence><sentence id="298">I still see the <span class="spatial object">package</span> in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was very small and it was sealed with <span class="spatial object">seal-locker</span>, actually sealed, and I guess included was a list of items that were in it. </sentence><sentence id="300">And a copy of that list, when we finally left <span class="country">Germany</span> and crossed the <span class="dlf">Pass</span> into <span class="country">Italy</span>, that list was over there with the customs official, officials. </sentence><sentence id="301">My parents were taken out of the <span class="spatial

that they had received. </sentence><sentence id="302">That's how strict things were handled in those days. </sentence><sentence id="303">At any rate, the day of departure arrived. </sentence><sentence id="304">I remember all night long my parents were still packing. </sentence><sentence id="305">I remember the last night in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="307">I still re...see her standing on her <span class="interior

place">Hamburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">We left from the <span class="building">railroad station</span> called and uh I took a doll with me. </sentence><sentence id="309">I took a <span class="spatial object">ball</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="310">I remember a little pin that my grandmother had given me and a few other toys. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">And uh we traveled to <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and slept the first night in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and continued the next day to <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="312">That is to say we crossed the <span class="dlf">Pass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="313">My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the <span class="spatial object">plane</span>...out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and uh some of them were even uh bodily examined. </sentence><sentence id="314">Now my mother was taken into one <span class="interior space">room</span> and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the <span class="spatial

her, touched her hair and said what do you have in there, and she said permanent, and uh the woman said don't answer me so fresh. </sentence><sentence id="318">Well, we finally crossed the and uh - look, some people smuggled things out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="319">That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="320">It was money smuggled

ended up for many years in <span class="building">prison</span>, and uh we left with the ten marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="327">We left with the little package that was packaged in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, and that's all we had with us. </sentence><sentence id="328">We arrived in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in <span class="populated place">Munich</span> and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the <span class="dlf">platform</span> in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> and really didn't know where to turn. </sentence><sentence id="329">To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of <span class="country">Italy</span>, and apparently in many such <span class="populated place">centers</span> of uh <span class="populated place">cities</span> where <span class="spatial object">trains</span> would come from <span class="country">Germany</span>, these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="331">And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in <span class="country">America</span>, and the same went for the Meyer family. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went. </sentence><sentence id="333">But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> who also took us around <span class="populated place">town</span>, showed us <span class="populated place">Bologne</span>, fed us, took us to <span class="building">restaurants</span>, and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh <span class="dlf">passage</span> for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from <span class="populated place">Bologne</span> to <span class="populated place">Bari</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="334">In <span class="populated place">Bari</span> we took a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="335">Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two <span class="spatial object">tripls</span>, because this was out of <span class="region">territorial Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">They would not allow us to pay with German money in <span class="country">Germany</span> for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="337">Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called. </sentence><sentence id="338">And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back. </sentence><sentence id="339">Of course it never did. </sentence><sentence id="340">By the way, speaking of the <span class="spatial object">lift</span> in in <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span>, many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the <span class="building">German court</span> somehow found out that uh indeed there was a <span class="spatial object">lift</span> stored in a certain man's uh <span class="building">warehouse</span> uh which had been distributed. </sentence><sentence id="341">The contents of not only our <span class="spatial object">lift</span> but I suppose many other people's uh <span class="spatial object">lifts</span>, had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families. </sentence><sentence id="342">And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early "60's as compensation for the <span class="spatial object">lift</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">Anyway, we're now uh in uh <span class="populated place">Bologne</span>. </sentence><sentence id="344">As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , . </sentence><sentence id="345">She writes about the Italian Jews and <span class="country">Italy</span> and its Jews, etd. </sentence><sentence id="346">It's a fantastic book I think. </sentence><sentence id="347">Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention <span class="country">Albania</span> at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in. </sentence><sentence id="348">Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about <span class="country">Albania</span> and the Italian role there. </sentence><sentence id="349">But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the <span class="dlf">border</span> to make their life more pleasant and easier. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time. </sentence></p><p><sentence

again to our surprise, because we really had no idea what was expecting us in <span class="country">Albania</span>, uh there were other immigrants, European immigrants already in <span

</sentence><sentence id="374">And uh we were very happy that this gentleman who had already been in <span class="country">Albania</span>, this was his job to be there every day when <span

</sentence><sentence id="382">So I don't know ta what extent we could empathasize with the feeling our parents experienced. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think that to us some of this was exciting

we didn't know what was facing us or what <span class="building">school</span> would be like or the usual things that children do - <span class="spatial object">toys</span>, we had almost none with us, just what we could carry in our arms or our little bag that each one of us had over their shoulder, and uh I do remember very well that for many many years the one thing that I missed so terribly was my <span class="spatial object">school bag</span>, and I always had in the back of my mind, well one day when I get to live in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, my <span

that behind, needless to say, and that was a tremendous uh and I missed it very badly. </sentence><sentence id="389">Well, these are the things that children of that age I think we experiencing.

wasn't until a few months later, and I'm not quite sure exactly whether it was May or June that the second <span class="building">hostel</span> had been rented and when we could move, be moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="417">OK. </sentence><sentence id="418">Uh so this us procedure here went on all through March and into April. </sentence><sentence id="419">April 5th, 1939, we woke up

would have cured it quickly. </sentence><sentence id="507">Uh I'm not sure what drugs were being used, but the native cure for typhoid fever is yougurt and milk because both of them evidentally

understood what this fear is all about. </sentence><sentence id="522">And and how all these years, from her illness, because she uh came back and maybe misdiagnosed, I'm not sure, but the doctors had

to remember that meanwhile the uh Axis had declared war, the entire Axis declared war on the <span class="country">United Stateq</span>, uh and I skipped here something very important and that is that in uh May, May 8th, 1940, the American consul had finally invited us to come to <span class="populated place">Naples</span> to receive our visas to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="567">Uh this was a very important episode in our lives and my parents immediately went to the ministry appropriate <span class="building">offices</span> in trying to get a

government received instructions from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> not to allow Jews to enter uh <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">And uh one other

off the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> because the Italian official in <span class="country">Albania</span> had received - he didn't want to open the <span class="spatial

<span class="spatial object">boat</span> and the man spent the rest of the war . </sentence><sentence id="570">But we didn't get that far because our invitation came maybe a week or two later and by that it had become official policy not to allow Jews officially into <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="571">We were stuck. </sentence><sentence id="572">And that entire summer, the whole summer of 1940, my parents used up every last penny of money that they had had to travel between and to go to each and every one, anyone who would listen to them they would go to and try to get permission to go to <span class="country">Italy</span> and it just - and there were wonderful Italian officials in <span class="country">Albania</span> who sincerely wanted to help, who tried every trick of the trade, and it just was not possible. </sentence><sentence id="573">I think my father's very last endeavor was to pay a visit to the <span class="building">Viceroy</span> in.

constructed. </sentence><sentence id="596">Uh when I say hugh I mean hundreds of meters of uh <span class="interior space">hallway</span> between the two sides of the <span

</sentence><sentence id="604">At any rate by the time we arrived there this uh uh so called <span class="building">harem</span> which I assume at one point must have been the uh glorious and splendid

covered the uh <span class="dlf">windows</span> with blankets and ( ) a rather cold winter because this is much more northlernly located than <span class="populated place">Duratso</span> and it was a very cold winter. </sentence><sentence id="607">Uh we were living, well for me first of all, it was fun again. </sentence><sentence id="608">A huge <span class="dlf">garden</span>, <span

from because I'm sure my mother didn't have enough milk for me, but I do remember that she bought the uh can of condensed milk and watered that down, and that's what the poor little puppy lived on for a while, and I also remember that one day she made some cream of wheat and it burned on these wonderful uh <span class="interior space">cooking facilities</span>, and somehow that became food for this

things that there were, we you know, we could have obtained, but we really didn't have any money, and there was a period exactly around this time that from the money that the Albanian government gave us, and I have a great recollection that this was on the order of four or four and a half lechs (ph) a day and I do remember actually going hungry. </sentence><sentence id="647">There was a period that my mother stole fruit and tomatoes out of the neighbor's <span class="dlf">garden</span> because there was really no food on the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence

have a very good collection of the paintings in our <span class="building">home</span> in <span class="populated place">Concord</span>. </sentence><sentence id="653">Uh he decided that he had to make

it is such a very typical story. </sentence><sentence id="806">We were her so-called <span class="building">court</span> Jews. </sentence><sentence id="807">She was such a strong supporter of Hitler.

uh when the chips were down, that is to say in 1943 when uh, well I don't have to repeat the history which is already known, but eventually the Germans regarded the Italians as their enemies and they actually occupied <span class="country">Albania</span>, and uh to the extent where they deported the Italians by <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, via back into <span

</sentence><sentence id="816">Uh a little bit earlier on, I suppose it must have been - well, let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="817">I I'm afraid we have to go back to 1942. </sentence><sentence id="818">In 1942, first of all the Germans are occupying <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, and a group of maybe approximately a hundred Yugoslave Jews accomp...came across the <span

to uh deliver the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span>, or things of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="859">We always had the dog with us, as little as she was, but our uh landlord did two things. </sentence><sentence id="860">One, he had a big German Shepherd dog who that night was away from the <span class="building">house</span> because they never fed the dog and the dog all night

</sentence><sentence id="861">And the other thing was he made a <span class="dlf">hole</span> in our, between our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and his so that in case something like

difficult. </sentence><sentence id="942">Uh this one particular officer told my mother point blank, if 1 were ever faced with a communist or a Jew, I would kill them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="943">And uh I don't know how she kept her posture, her composure or her charm, but she did. </sentence><sentence id="944">Uh she was a tiny woman. </sentence><sentence id="945">No, no taller than myself and maybe half my size, and uh yet very strong. </sentence><sentence id="946">And uh indeed a few days after this particular conversation, we uh one day at noon time heard a terrible noise not far away. </sentence><sentence id="947">I mean an explosion, terrible noise. </sentence><sentence id="948">And uh what had happened was that this very same officer had taken a hand grenade and thrown it at random in a passing <span class="spatial object">truck</span> which was loaded with Italian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="949">They now had become his enemies, I mean, you know what the Germans thought of the Italians, uh and uh he just out of the sheer fun of it threw this grenade and probably killed and wounded everyone that was in that particular <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="951">My father uh really got into such a state of uh psychological state I should say, that uh his only contact was when engineer would go to this <span class="populated

among those who had escaped from <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> and they actually, the family, uh husband and wife, young couple, they had actually settled in this little <span class="populated place">village</span>, . </sentence><sentence id="953">I don't know what they did for a living. </sentence><sentence id="954">And uh uh they had seen this man - now I have to add, this is true - my father did not typically look Jewish, whatever this may mean, and I'm saying this with tongue in cheek because I really don't believe in this uh kind of thing, but yet he wa...had a very light complexion, uh more or less the kind of uh upturned nose like I do, and he didn't, he he looked quite German. </sentence><sentence id="955">Uh and the...he probably wore one of those berets, and uh leather boots. </sentence><sentence id="956">They had seen him in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and they were absolutely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="957">They thought ah-ha, there is a uh Fifth (ph) Column person trying to find Jews, and they actually went in hiding for the duration of his stay. </sentence><sentence id="958">He found this out only many many months later. ( ) </sentence><sentence id="959">to as well and then met my father one day and told him this story, so he could have passed. </sentence><sentence id="960">You know a human contact so much for that but he almost became blind because of psychological stress. </sentence><sentence id="961">He could not take this any longer, and uh decided he's going to come back to <span class="populated

so everybady knew we were Jewish and after my father came back END OF TAPE ..continental waters of the <span class="env feature">Indian Ocean</span>, you know, what do you call it, uh <span class="env

that there was full moon they couldn't dare. </sentence><sentence id="974">They could only go when there was no <span class="env feature">moon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="975">I mean it was a very dangerous undertaking and as I say I have no way of knowing whether anybody ever made it . </sentence><sentence id="976">Anyway uh we happened : Many Albanians have gone underground, young people have gone underground, have joined the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="977"><span class="country">Albania</span> had its own partisan group under the command of who lived until just a few years ago, and all them were together under the command of Tito (ph). </sentence><sentence id="978">Uh in the northern part of <span class="country">Albania</span>, obviously, uh the activities were much uh stronger than in the parts of uh <span class="populated place">Duratso</span> or or anywhere around there. </sentence><sentence id="979">Uh but <span class="region">mountaneous areas</span> were completely infested by uh Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="980">And uh here also uh throughout the years, uh the Italian con...uh truck drivers had a very hard time. </sentence><sentence id="981">Their <span class="spatial object">convoys</span> were usually attacked and emptied out and so on. </sentence><sentence id="982">I mean this was how they made their living, and this is where they got their food and their substenance. </sentence><sentence id="983">There's no way where they got uh money or food or anything or or ammunition or weapons from the uh Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="984">But anyway uh the Germans were out to look for Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="985">And we had been warned that uh we should stay at <span class="building">home</span> as little as possible. </sentence><sentence id="986">Of course they would come. </sentence><sentence id="987">OK. </sentence><sentence id="988">It was Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="989">1943. </sentence><sentence id="990">And uh we really did uh heed this warning and we walked along the <span class="env feature">beach</span> and we were maybe some other visited maybe some other immigrants and together we went some other pllace. </sentence><sentence id="991">We simply were not <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="992">Maybe three or four days after uh Rosh Hashanah uh my mother was sweeping the <span class="dlf">steps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="993">Now the <span class="building">house</span> we lived in, it was that uh was really a <span class="building">wooden shack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="994">It was a <span class="building">summer home</span> again of two German families who lived in They shared this <span class="building">house</span>, and each one really consisted of one <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> and little <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="995">Each one opening out into the <span class="interior space">front porch</span> and the <span class="interior space">porch</span> had a few <span class="dlf">steps</span> into the <span class="env feature">sand</span> and that's that's the extent of it. </sentence><sentence id="996">No, no uh <span class="interior space">bathroom facilities</span>. </sentence><sentence id="997">An <span class="building">outhouse</span> in the back of it, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="998">So uh it was maybe seven, eight o'clock in the morning, I'm not sure, and my mother was sweeping the <span class="dlf">front steps</span> when out of no where a German officer with a few soldiers appeared and said, uh , I have been looking for you for several days already and I never find you at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="999">And my mother had the presence of mind to lock the <span class="dlf">door</span> of my father, of my father's <span class="interior space">room</span> - he was <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1000">He was luckily still in the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1003">He had heard that we were such a uh charming German family and uh we were uh, we would be hospitable he was sure, and uh so on and so forth, and he went on and on and on, and he's so happy that he finally met us. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And where is , so my mother told him that he had gone into to look for an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>

</sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh he told us that his soldiers were combing the <span class="env feature">beach</span> for communists, for Partisans, and if my mother didn't care too much, wouldn't mind too much, he would like to make this his <span class="building">headquarters</span> for the day. </sentence><sentence id="1011">This officer really and truly stayed the entire day with us. </sentence><sentence id="1012">My mother kept brewing coffee and bring whatever refreshments she could think of, never went into the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Somehow this never realized that we didn't go to our <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1014">My father sat on this <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, maybe six or eight hours that day. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And uh they took me for a walk down the <span class="env feature">beach</span> towards afternoon and uh wanted to take a picture with this . </sentence><sentence id="1016">I wore two long braids, wanted to take a picture of this very typical Germanic looking girl, and uh took a picture of me and also had to show off and threw a grenade into the <span class="env feature">water</span> and show ne how the fish were all dying and and foating up to the surface, and uh finally, finally at dusk, really departed from the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And promised that in a few days they would come and visit again and he was so interested in my father, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Well, uh fortunately we had really found a place in and together with uh three other Italian truck drivers who by now really were more or less uh without work because once the Germans took over they hardly used these Italian truck drivers anymore, and they were also by now enemies of the regime and they really didn't know what they were going to do or whether they were going to go back to <span class="country">Italy</span> or would stay in <span class="country">Albania</span> or what they should be doing. </sentence><sentence id="1019">At any rate, we were very good friends with one particular uh individual, uh was his name. , </sentence><sentence id="1020">and uh two of his nephews I believe and together we took a uh <span class="interior

for the rent. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And uh here now really the worst of our stay in <span class="country">Albania</span> started. </sentence><sentence id="1023">The Germans were completely in uh control of <span class="country">Albania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1024">As typical as always they uh uh put in, they never did their own dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="1025">They always would create a local SS group of uh you know natives who would do their dirty work, as in some places they had the Iron Guard and in some places whatever they called them. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Here they called them the Ballistas (ph), a group of uh rough-necks really who decided to you know go on the <span class="region">German side</span>, Albanians uh who harrassed the Italians something awful, mostly for money. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And I remember that uh all of these uh friends of ours, these Italians, had uh uh you know, sold their <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="1029">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Uh but these Ballistas would come in the middle of the night and search their uh <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1031">they didn't come to us . </sentence><sentence id="1032">It became exceedingly exceedingly dangerous and exceedingly uh uncomfortable is uh is an understatement of the word. </sentence><sentence id="1033">Uh these <span class="building">Ballistas</span>, would come in the middle of the night always. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I mean this is this is their method, this is the way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1035">You always create much more terror and fear in people at night. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Uh they would you know in in <span

</sentence><sentence id="1038">At any rate, uh by the winter of of uh of "43 or "44, by the winter of "44, all of these Italians who had evacuated by the Germans, on <span class="spatial

story uh how he was taken by the Germans and how they were treated, like new enemies. </sentence><sentence id="1043">At any rate uh uh the these people who, with whom we were living were evacuated and so we also had to leave the <span class="building">home</span>, this <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because it was too costly for us, and we moved to another place and to another place and I mean we were just moving around all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Summer of 1944, maybe June, July, whatever, uh notices went up on the uh on the <span class="env

only uh unpleasant but very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It became a point you know, why aren't you in <span class="country">Germany</span> doing your duty and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1048">You know, my father wasn't all that old at that point yet. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Uh we ceased going there. </sentence><sentence id="1050">We simply did not go there anymore and uh uh now of course the big started. </sentence><sentence id="1051">What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="1052">Now some of us, by this time all, however mamy Jews were left, we were all together in , because this was the only place we could be. </sentence><sentence id="1053">All the <span class="populated place">cities</span> along the <span class="env feature">coast</span> had been mined by the Germans, and uh al... altogether it was much safer I guess to to to be in . </sentence><sentence id="1054">Uh Partisan activity at this stage of the game was extemely active. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Every night, the moment it got dark, they would come down from the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, do all kinds of mostly attacking German positions attacking uh uh places of German concentration of soldiers, whatever - <span class="dlf">minimg bridges</span>, <span class="dlf">mining roads</span> and so on and shooting all night long.

would come, go into <span class="populated place">town</span> and would see uh you know, the results of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And uh not knowing what was going on, my mother and I once uh were caught by uh you know - went into <span class="populated place">town</span> and spent and saw this and it was really horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="1062">We never thereafter walked into the <span class="building">market place</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh we were registered, and when it came to name and and address and where it was and how, religion, the <span

some of our people panicked and decided to uh escape to the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1065">There were a few uh at least male members of the family that went into the <span class="env
