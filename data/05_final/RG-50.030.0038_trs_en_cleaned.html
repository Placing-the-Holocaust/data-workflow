<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell us about the family which you grew up in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a "normal family." </sentence><sentence id="20">My father was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="21">They were originally from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">My parents were -- came to <span class="country">Austria</span> right after the first World War, married in <span class="country">Austria</span>, and there were three children in the family. </sentence><sentence id="23">There would have been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth. </sentence><sentence id="24">I was the oldest. </sentence><sentence id="25">My sister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years younger. </sentence><sentence id="26">A normal family, as I said, with <span class="building">schools</span> and activities, fun -- although some of that was disrupted by the death of my father in 1930. </sentence><sentence id="27">I was nine years old, the oldest at the time of the three children. </sentence><sentence id="28">And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried. </sentence><sentence id="29">My father was 39. </sentence><sentence id="30">And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family. </sentence><sentence id="31">But that was all bearable and we coped as best we could. </sentence><sentence id="32">We do not want to forget that in those years it was still, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: And these were hard times. </sentence><sentence id="50">Just as here in <span class="country">America</span> in the middle "30s, latter "30s, we had to make with -- make ends meet with what was available to us. </sentence><sentence id="51">And income -- my mother was a, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="52">And the real, the real tragedy began then in 1938 with the annexation of <span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">Where that <span class="building">family structure</span>, that family entity as in so many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="60">Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes. </sentence><sentence id="64">When we grew up in <span class="country">Austria</span>, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="65">It so  happens that I lived in a <span class="populated place">district</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> where there were more Jews than in other <span class="populated place">districts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">It was the <span class="populated place">20th district</span>, and the <span class="populated place">second district</span> had more Jews than the <span class="populated place">20th</span>, and a few other <span class="populated place">districts</span> had -- but the majority of the <span class="region">areas</span> were non-Jewish or very few Jews and antisemitism was almost a part of daily life. </sentence><sentence id="67">It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it just became part of life. </sentence><sentence id="68">If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes part of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent. </sentence><sentence id="69">But from time to time, there were denigrations. </sentence><sentence id="70">Sometime we were spit at. </sentence><sentence id="71">Sometime we were singled out for a particular rough treatments in <span class="building">schools</span>, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly. </sentence><sentence id="72">When I think back to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were set apart. </sentence><sentence id="73">There was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which automatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed. </sentence><sentence id="74">And at Christmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood even if we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="75">Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in trimming a <span class="env feature">tree</span> or sharing in, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all surface. </sentence><sentence id="76">As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater <span class="populated place">community</span> where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them. </sentence><sentence id="77">But the excesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression years. </sentence><sentence id="78">I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that all these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="79">So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we asserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the <span class="building">Hebrew schools</span>, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for that by people who were looking at us. </sentence><sentence id="80">But it was a segment in history that does not reflect too well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into "38, it is very easily perceptible. </sentence><sentence id="81">You can touch it. </sentence><sentence id="82">You can feel it. </sentence><sentence id="83">You could see it, that as soon as the Austrian Anschluss" took place, <span class="country">Austria</span> in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several months, the Jews in <span class="country">Austria</span> underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months than the Jews of <span class="country">Germany</span> did in the previous five years from "33 to "38. </sentence><sentence id="84">It lent itself -- the climate in <span class="country">Austria</span> lent itself more to antisemitic excesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Give us examples. </sentence><sentence id="108">It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="111">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="112">What happened to Leo Bretholz? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had been arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could -- " Term used to described the incorporation of <span class="country">Austria</span> in the German <span class="country">Reich</span> on March 11, 1938. </sentence><sentence id="114"> leaving <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="115">I had already left <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">And an aunt of mine had left for <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> right after the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span> as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was my mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it will be very bad, as we can see. </sentence><sentence id="118">People were arrested every day and within days or the most a few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="119">Now whether they were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out. </sentence><sentence id="120">But they received a <span class="spatial object">container</span> with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to escape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to escape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="121">But there were these, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the people who were freed from <span class="populated place">camps</span> periodically brought back other horror stories, so we know that. </sentence><sentence id="122">My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it is constantly a source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="123">But then when I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as these, he confirmed to me that, "Would your mother be able to speak today, she would still say...she was glad she did it." </sentence><sentence id="124">So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me out and saving my life. </sentence><sentence id="125">She was a good woman. </sentence><sentence id="126">My mother was what you might call in, in Hebrew, it's described as "Eshet Khayil,"" -- woman of valor. </sentence><sentence id="127">She did the best she could under the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="128">I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She and my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: What did she do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people, people that were less well-off than we or less fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="148">Always helped somebody. </sentence><sentence id="149">There was this poor painter around the corner from us. </sentence><sentence id="150">When the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> needed painting, she called him. </sentence><sentence id="151">He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job. </sentence><sentence id="152">And when it was finished, the painting wasn't -- the painted <span class="interior space">room</span> was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job because he needed it for his family, you see. </sentence><sentence id="153">But, I got to get myself together to make this thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Let's pull it back. </sentence><sentence id="162">Pull it back. </sentence><sentence id="163">Your mother... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: She urged me to leave, and I did leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: I took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="populated place">Koblenz</span>, to the west of <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="populated place">Trier</span>, the ancient <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Trier</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">By arrangement with a committee in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>; it was called the Ezra &gt; Woman of valor (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="173"> Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Who were the <span class="building">Ezra Committee</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: The <span class="building">Ezra</span> was an aid committee, almost like a <span class="building">HIAS</span>," perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="180">Aid to refugees that came from <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span> to <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>, provide some <span class="building">shelter</span>, provide food, <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and help these people who could not stay in <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span> unless they had regularized, temporary documents. </sentence><sentence id="181">Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that. </sentence><sentence id="182">Others that fled and came illegally, could not. </sentence><sentence id="183">And the <span class="building">Ezra committee</span> was such a committee. </sentence><sentence id="184">And a Mr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from <span class="populated place">Trier</span> into <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, was in the employ of Ezra. </sentence><sentence id="185">In a way because later when I went to <span class="country">Belgium</span>, he was also the one that smuggled us into <span class="country">Belgium</span>, but I am jumping ahead here. </sentence><sentence id="186">But we were -- I went to the <span class="populated place">border town</span> of <span class="populated place">Trier</span>, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in <span class="populated place">Trier</span> and smuggled me across the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">Actually he took me to the <span class="env feature">river</span>, the <span class="env feature">Sauer River</span> and asked me cross and then meet him at the other side of the Sauer. </sentence><sentence id="188">And during the night from October 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in <span class="region">western Germany</span> -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="189">He had asked me to put a pair of dry socks into my <span class="spatial object">coat pocket</span> so that when I came across and once I had crossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I didn't have dry socks in my <span class="spatial object">pocket</span> after I had crossed the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">When he told me I was to cross that <span class="env feature">river</span>, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="191">I said, "Yes, I know how to swim." </sentence><sentence id="192">I said, "Would it be necessary, you think?" </sentence><sentence id="193">because he told me I would wade across. </sentence><sentence id="194">But no way could I wade across that <span class="env feature">river</span> after four days of rain because that <span class="env feature">river</span> carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, <span class="env feature">branches</span>, mud, all kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="195">That <span class="env feature">river</span> springs in the <span class="env feature">Ardenne Mountains</span> and comes down. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's a, it's really a tributary of the <span class="env feature">Moselle</span>, a small <span class="env feature">river</span> which under normal circumstances is a <span class="env feature">creek</span>, a small <span class="env feature">stream</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">I went there later in years with, with my family to get to that same <span class="region">area</span>, and people were just waiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took into the <span class="env feature">river</span>, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my <span class="spatial object">chest</span>, and then here go the dry socks in my <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>, and it wasn't a concern of mine. </sentence><sentence id="198">My concern was to get across. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I did! </sentence><sentence id="200">And on the other side, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, and my aunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety. </sentence><sentence id="201">Or at the moment, relative safety, because three days later, I was arrested in <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">The police came into this <span class="building">cafe</span> where I was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed. </sentence><sentence id="203">Actually, my coat was still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so they arrested me and took me to <span class="building">jail</span>, and I spent the night in <span class="building">jail</span> in the <span class="building">Luxembourg jail</span> -- by the way, a very clean facility. </sentence><sentence id="204">And the next morning, they interrogated me. </sentence><sentence id="205">How did I come over? </sentence><sentence id="206">I said, "I crossed the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="env feature">river Sauer</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="208">Who brought you over?" </sentence><sentence id="209">I said, "I just crossed." " </sentence><sentence id="210">And how did you get into <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="211">I just walked into <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>." </sentence><sentence id="212">I * <span class="building">Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213"> wasn't going to say, "Mr. Becker brought me over." </sentence><sentence id="214">And, well, it is my choice. </sentence><sentence id="215">I have two choices. </sentence><sentence id="216">I can pick a place where I want to be taken to out of <span class="populated place">Luxembourg</span>, either <span class="country">Belgium</span> or <span class="country">France</span> or back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">So the choice was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="218">I said, "Well, I have an aunt in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">Maybe I can make my way to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>." </sentence><sentence id="220">So they decided, yes, take me to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, to this <span class="dlf">Luxembourg-French border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">There is a little <span class="populated place">town</span> called <span class="populated place">Thionville-les-Bains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">It is like a <span class="building">thermal spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="223">And they took me there and they -- the next morning -- and they -- <span class="spatial object">commuter train</span> that went to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, just about a half an hour or 40 minute ride. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I crossed into <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">But earlier before we went -- before we took that <span class="spatial object">train</span>, at the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, when they went to the ticket to, to, to show that to the <span class="dlf">ticket window</span> that day, were transporting me, whatever, they needed to have transportation. </sentence><sentence id="226">My uncle had found out that next day I will be taken to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, appeared at the <span class="building">railroad station</span> and he wore a cap. </sentence><sentence id="227">And he was standing on the side, and I noticed him and he noticed me, and he did this to his cap, the visor of the cap: he turned it around. </sentence><sentence id="228">There is an expression in Yiddish which translates "Turn the <span class="spatial object">visor</span> around," which to me meant, "If you can come back, come back." </sentence><sentence id="229">And when they had taken me to the <span class="dlf">border</span> and I crossed, they indicated to me that the other end of the <span class="dlf">border</span>, just a few hundred yards inside <span class="country">France</span>, there is a <span class="populated place">Jewish camp</span>, they said. </sentence><sentence id="230">That's all they told me. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they will probably be able help me. </sentence><sentence id="232">But when I told them earlier, "How do you want me to manage going into <span class="country">France</span> by myself? </sentence><sentence id="233">Can you --" They said, "Well, you just told us that you managed to swim a <span class="env feature">river</span> and come into <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">Now if you could make it across a <span class="env feature">river</span>, you will make it across <span class="region">dry land</span>, we know." </sentence><sentence id="235">They were sort of patronizing me but also very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="236">They were not in any way vicious. </sentence><sentence id="237">They were just doing their job to get me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I was glad they didn't -- that I wasn't sent back to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="239">As I crossed into <span class="country">France</span>, I went to that <span class="populated place">camp</span> and it was a <span class="populated place">preparatory camp</span>, <span class="populated place">hakh'sharah</span>,* where, where Jewish young people were preparing for aleeyah" to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">I got into this <span class="region">area</span> and somebody at the <span class="dlf">gate</span> actually stopped me, wanted to know who | am, and I said, "I am a Jewish fellow, just escaped from <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">The Luxembourg people told me -- Luxembourg authorities told me that you might be able to help me...." "Well, they do that periodically just to make you feel that when you get across the <span class="dlf">border</span>, you will be all right."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2095">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2097">A: First, I would like for people to understand that if the hero that they, somebody whom they  8 call hero -- whether they look at a person tells about it, or a <span class="spatial object">monument</span> that that, of some hero of years gone by --only that person knew really how scared he really was, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2098">You make a hero of somebody, but that person knew deep down that there was a lot of fear. </sentence><sentence id="2099">Heroism isn't something that comes sort of at the spur of the moment. </sentence><sentence id="2100">How did we do it?There was only one way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Other than having tools to cut out the bottom of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> or cut out the <span class="dlf">ceiling</span>, there was only one way -- the obvious way -- a <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And these <span class="dlf">windows</span> were <span class="dlf">squares</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2103">Perhaps 24 by 18, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2104">But you see, in <span class="spatial object">cattle cars</span> they are normally called "huit, <span class="spatial object">quarante</span>"" -- eight horses, or 40 men, in military terms. </sentence><sentence id="2105">Both <span class="dlf">windows</span> had bars, straight bars. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Two <span class="dlf">bars</span>: the one on the one side facing the other <span class="dlf">track</span> that runs parallel had <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2107">That would not have prevented us from using that <span class="dlf">window</span>, because a <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> that's rusty can easily be bent back and forth and can be eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="2108">A <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> can be cut by bending back and forth a few times, and then you have just the <span class="dlf">bars</span> to contend with. </sentence><sentence id="2109">But that <span class="dlf">window</span> was not in our plan, because that was the <span class="dlf">window</span> that was next to the other <span class="dlf">track</span> and you don't want to jump when you jump onto a <span class="dlf">track</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2110">Especially from a moving <span class="spatial object">train</span>, because you can't really take that big chance. </sentence><sentence id="2111">I mean, you want to succeed. </sentence><sentence id="2112">The left side -- the <span class="region">north side</span>, as it were, because we were traveling east -- was the one that faced the <span class="env

class="dlf">window</span> we chose through which we will make our getaway, we hoped to make our getaway. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And as soon as the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, we had all night to think about that. </sentence><sentence id="2115">We were walking in, in, around in miserable conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2116">I mean, we were sliding back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="2117">So the only way we tried in the morning to move these <span class="spatial object">bars</span>, but it wasn't possible. </sentence><sentence id="2118">We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is by trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly. </sentence><sentence id="2119">And we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in <span class="env feature">human wastes</span>, made them wet, to create a tensile cloth. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Dry cloth you cannot wring too well. </sentence><sentence id="2121">A <span class="spatial object">towel</span>, for instance. </sentence><sentence id="2122">But a wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture has dripped out entirely until it's dry. </sentence><sentence id="2123">That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style when you use it on an arm. </sentence><sentence id="2124">We used that as a tourniquet. </sentence><sentence id="2125">So if you figure that two <span class="spatial object">bars</span>, you twist that sweater around the <span class="spatial object">bars</span> and then you go twisting, twisting, twisting until you can, We helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="2126">We tried that several times. </sentence><sentence id="2127">It was no give yet. </sentence><sentence id="2128">There was no give yet. </sentence><sentence id="2129">But we hoped that something will happen. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And then we moved in the side and see maybe it gets loose a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2131">But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five minutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring. </sentence><sentence id="2132">We were working under pressure. </sentence><sentence id="2133">This was our getaway. </sentence><sentence id="2134">This was life. </sentence><sentence id="2135">There the <span class="env

id="2136">And this was -- we were approaching <span class="region">champagne country</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2137">The <span class="region">area</span> of lusciousness. </sentence><sentence id="2138">But here we were going to certain death, which now we know. </sentence><sentence id="2139">At that 5 Eight, forty (French). </sentence><sentence id="2140"> 9 time, we only speculated. </sentence><sentence id="2141">But I am glad we did speculate. </sentence><sentence id="2142">It didn't let us fall into some sort of lethargy, like a lot of people were. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that glimmer of hope where the <span class="dlf">bars</span> in the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so slightly. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the <span class="dlf">hole</span> that it is set in. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Rust came out. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Now, we never hoped to get the <span class="spatial object">bar</span> out of there; because they are set in like an inch or so, half an inch. </sentence><sentence id="2147">But we hoped to, them to be bending. </sentence><sentence id="2148">We worked for a while, and we saw them ever so slightly bend inward. </sentence><sentence id="2149">Then we used our hands to move them apart again, so that they should start loosening. </sentence><sentence id="2150">And it did that! </sentence><sentence id="2151">We moved them back into the proper position. </sentence><sentence id="2152">We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever so slightly more of a bend. </sentence><sentence id="2153">And we put that again, did that. </sentence><sentence id="2154">We worked all day, being mindful of the fact that if the <span class="spatial object">train</span> would have to come to a stop, these things would have to be put into proper position. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2156">They were in the first <span class="spatial object">car</span>--that was a <span class="spatial object">passenger car</span>--and the last. </sentence><sentence id="2157">These were Gestapo, and these were the German guards. </sentence><sentence id="2158">And, of course, <span class="building">French police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The French police, French collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="2160">That's a chapter by itself. </sentence><sentence id="2161">Towards the late afternoon, those <span class="spatial object">bars</span> had moved apart, through our efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And we put them back into the original position, just again in case the <span class="spatial object">train</span> would come to a stop and the guards would come up and inspect. </sentence><sentence id="2163">One time the <span class="spatial object">train</span> stopped at a <span class="building">station</span>, and the people there seeing it wanted to reach me. </sentence><sentence id="2164">We shouted "<span class="env feature">Water</span>!" </sentence><sentence id="2165">The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three <span class="spatial object">transports</span> going by there every week. </sentence><sentence id="2166">Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us. </sentence><sentence id="2167">And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends. </sentence><sentence id="2168">But some of them, husbands or wives or children, whoever had left families behind in <span class="populated place">Drancy</span> or hiding out somewhere, they would drop envelopes, and the people would pick them up and would put stamps on them and mail them. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Or just notes: "We are going away. </sentence><sentence id="2170">We are going away. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Don't forget us." </sentence><sentence id="2172">Cryptic notes like this, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2173">But they didn't let them approach. </sentence><sentence id="2174">We only made one stop. </sentence><sentence id="2175">In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the <span class="spatial object">train</span> -- because it's in the book - - when the <span class="spatial

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3395">Q: Would you describe how you got there and what the group was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3397">A: The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or the fascist regimes. </sentence><sentence id="3398">There were some people that were still hold-outs from the Spanish Civil War that had come to <span class="country">France</span> -- this was seven, eight -- or six or so years later -- and had joined. </sentence><sentence id="3399">There were a couple of German deserters. </sentence><sentence id="3400">There was -- were one or two of Russians, Georgian Russians or Russian Georgians, who, who had been incorporated into the German army after the Germans entered <span class="country">Russia</span>, took them captive. </sentence><sentence id="3401">They incorporated Ukrainians and other nationals from <span class="country">Russia</span> into their <span class="building">armed forces</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3402">So these people may have been hurt or may have been wounded and sent to <span class="country">France</span> for recuperation. </sentence><sentence id="3403">A lot of German soldiers came to <span class="region">northern France</span> to recuperate or ride out their injuries in some way. </sentence><sentence id="3404">Well, a couple of them then ran away and joined with the <span class="spatial object">French underground</span> because they were really against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3405">There were some people from <span class="region">Alsace-Lorraine</span>, who traditionally were either violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of view. </sentence><sentence id="3406">But there were many <span class="populated place">Alsace-Lorraine</span> citizens who were deeply nationalistic French. </sentence><sentence id="3407">These people resisted the Germans just as well. </sentence><sentence id="3408">And there were a few of those in the -- in that group, and a lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3409">What was that group? </sentence><sentence id="3410">It was really a group called the, the Vichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France. </sentence><sentence id="3411">These people were prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades. </sentence><sentence id="3412">Learning crafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and <span class="building">building</span>, and that sort of thing, to prepare them for service in <span class="country">Germany</span> for the new order, to be incorporated into the new order. </sentence><sentence id="3413">This was a Petain youth movement called Companion de France. </sentence><sentence id="3414">Their uniforms were blue. </sentence><sentence id="3415">Their berets were blue. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And they sang the Petain nationalistic songs in training. </sentence><sentence id="3417">This group took on the semblance of a <span class="populated place">Companion de France camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3418">When we -- when I presented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, "Chief de Camp," Maurice Bardin -- B-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth certificate, he did not ask me any questions. </sentence><sentence id="3419">He says, "Welcome to our <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3420">We will call you "Henri." </sentence><sentence id="3421">That's what we will call you." </sentence><sentence id="3422">And they made out the ID for us, and I was accepted as one of the, of the group. </sentence><sentence id="3423">This group was mainly engaged in sending messages. </sentence><sentence id="3424">Messages from the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> of <span class="region">Savoy</span> to <span class="populated place">Lyon</span>, or sending emissaries up to <span class="populated place">Lyon</span> with certain instructions as to what to do when the next <span class="spatial object">German column</span> comes by. </sentence><sentence id="3425">But on the surface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="3426">And in the morning, we would get up at 4:30 and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="3427">And I have a picture here shows the snows. </sentence><sentence id="3428">And we would take cold <span class="interior space">showers</span>, because there was no warm water. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And after that we would have breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="3430">But before the cold <span class="interior space">shower</span>, we would run a mile or two. </sentence><sentence id="3431">All part of the youth movement -- exercise before we start the day working. </sentence><sentence id="3432">But there were <span class="building">carpentry shops</span> and all kinds of other. </sentence><sentence id="3433">So if someone would come in and observe the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> of Companion de France. </sentence><sentence id="3434">And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and ID, so that I could take a <span class="spatial object">train</span> anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was part of the Vichy government Companion de France. </sentence><sentence id="3435">But 80 percent of us were Jewish, hiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements. </sentence><sentence id="3436">It was not until  2 sometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January - -that overnight we had to clear out the <span class="building">facility</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3437">The Mayor of <span class="populated place">Saint-Vallier</span> had notified us that word has come from the French Milice -- the militia, the <span class="region">Vichy France</span> collaborators with the Germans; and they were vicious, they were probably as much, if not more, vicious than the Germans -- that they will come for an inspection of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, of the <span class="populated place">Companion camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3438">Evidently word had come out, or the rumor had been circulating, that there is something fishy going on there. </sentence><sentence id="3439">They wanted to have a firsthand view. </sentence><sentence id="3440">Well, when they came later, 24 hours later, the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was empty. </sentence><sentence id="3441">We received our walking papers. </sentence><sentence id="3442">I have them here. </sentence><sentence id="3443">The release papers from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3444">We got tickets to go into various directions. </sentence><sentence id="3445">I and a couple of other people was assigned to <span class="populated place">Chalus</span>, near <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3446">And we took a <span class="spatial object">train</span> to <span class="populated place">Chalus</span>, and we arrived in <span class="populated place">Chalus</span> and joined another underground movement there. </sentence><sentence id="3447">And in <span class="populated place">Chalus</span>, in connection with the Jewish hiding out community in <span class="populated place">Limoges</span>, we were engaged in producing false identification cards and to help children go get to the <span class="dlf">border</span> so that they should be able to cross into <span class="country">Switzerland</span> to perhaps <span class="country">Spain</span> and further on to <span class="country">Portugal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3448">This was our main endeavor, except also putting up <span class="dlf">road blocks</span> and doing communication between the various underground groups in the <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3703">A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, through the <span class="building">Radio London</span>, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of weeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a debarkation. </sentence><sentence id="3704">Where it would happen, we did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3705">But we knew it was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="3706">I did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of turmoil out there. </sentence><sentence id="3707">There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always my urge, to be part of something. </sentence><sentence id="3708">So that between that time and the actual <span class="dlf">landing</span>, there was very little time to do whatever we had to do. </sentence><sentence id="3709">However, how did we feel, coming to your question about transporting. </sentence><sentence id="3710">First of all, we had to produce the cards. </sentence><sentence id="3711">We made them with false stamps and seals. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And we, we were counterfeiters, you see! </sentence><sentence id="3713">That's what we were -- just like when I escaped from that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3714">The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a natural thing; because the urge was to be free. </sentence><sentence id="3715">So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations involved. </sentence><sentence id="3716">But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication. </sentence><sentence id="3717">But at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us. </sentence><sentence id="3718">It's in hindsight, as you look: "What did we do? </sentence><sentence id="3719">My God, we were really young and...and dumb!" </sentence><sentence id="3720">That sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3721">But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way endangering us. </sentence><sentence id="3722">Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers. </sentence><sentence id="3723">You could go into a <span class="building">restaurant</span> as a French citizen. </sentence><sentence id="3724">You could go into a <span class="building">restaurant</span> to have a meal and the Milice(tm) would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches. </sentence><sentence id="3725">Well, if you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not involved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to <span class="populated place">town</span>, but you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it along. </sentence><sentence id="3726">Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID. </sentence><sentence id="3727">So we were just part of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems. </sentence><sentence id="3728">But we did not consider our activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under that regime. </sentence><sentence id="3729">Although we were exposed a little more. </sentence><sentence id="3730">We would have been exposed a little more to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean instant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4106">And this whole program, that whole committee was supported by the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="4107">So we had an <span

with the false ID papers, became employed by that <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4108">And as later, after liberation of <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, which was in August of "44, and later the victory when people came back from the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, again this Committee did a good job of, number one, helping them to get over the first <span class="dlf">hump</span>, and later to establish themselves with a <span class="building">residence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4109">Even helped them find relatives, because the Committee was in touch with the <span class="building">Red Cross</span> and other organizations and institutions that were, after the war, spring up here and there to just see who had survived and who can be reached. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And all these communication means were used to, whether it was by <span class="spatial object">telegraph</span> or radio or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4111">But the <span class="building">COJDASOR</span> was that committee that was established afterwards, and I worked for that. </sentence><sentence id="4112">But between the landing and actually the liberation, there was just a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="4113">Because, because <span class="country">France</span> fell pretty fast to the forces of Resistance, and then the Germans were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="4114">And the rest took place in the north of <span class="country">France</span>, of course, where the advancing Allied troops just entered <span class="populated place">Paris</span> in August of "44. </sentence><sentence id="4115">And had one major scare in the winter of "44, when after the Battle of the Bulge the Germans
