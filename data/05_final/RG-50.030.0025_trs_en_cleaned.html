</sentence><sentence id="166">This was -- I think this was already after the winter. </sentence><sentence id="167">The winter was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="168">In <span

</sentence><sentence id="183">We had many things. </sentence><sentence id="184">And they paid to a Polish man what he was bringing the bread to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to the

</sentence><sentence id="193">One of the <span class="building">house</span>, one Jewish family, the Bielskis. </sentence><sentence id="194">And they had, I think, about 10 brothers and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="195">And his sister was married to uncle of mine, but I never knew him, too. </sentence><sentence id="196">It was great uncle, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="197">And she said -- she was too, in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And she said to him, "You know what, I saw by the Boldos" a beautiful girl, and I would like you to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="517">A: When I came into the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, they had only 75 people. </sentence><sentence id="518">That was the group of the Bielskis brothers. </sentence><sentence id="519">That was the four brothers -- the three brothers and they had their brother, Aaron, 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="520">And they have a sister, what she was married to Chaya's brother. </sentence><sentence id="521">So that was the <span class="building">Bielskis</span> and the <span class="building">Dzienciolskis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="522">This was the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="523">But later came another seven men and they made 70 people, 70 or 80 people, when I came in. </sentence><sentence id="524">This was the beginning of the partisans because people were -- went away from the <span class="env feature">forest</span> -- went away from the <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="525">They didn't have a place there. </sentence><sentence id="526">And they -- the <span class="dlf">doors</span> from the <span class="building">Bielskis brother</span> were open for everybody, for old, children, sick people. </sentence><sentence id="527">And they had always food. </sentence><sentence id="528">They didn't  have steaks, but they have bread and water. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were very good. </sentence><sentence id="530">They were no different, but later, then many people came in. </sentence><sentence id="531">So there were men that said, "Listen, why do I have to go and grab food and risk my life? </sentence><sentence id="532">My wife is not here, my children are not here. </sentence><sentence id="533">Why should I risk the life for them?" </sentence><sentence id="534">But the Bielskis brother said, "Everybody who is coming has to have a place here. </sentence><sentence id="535">And eerybody will have a piece of bread." </sentence><sentence id="536">They will not have maybe something else, but bread they will give everybody. </sentence><sentence id="537">This was one <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, one big <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and they were cooking potatoes with a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="538">And this was the food. </sentence><sentence id="539">Later, when the people came in more and more, they went out and knew that the Germans were in this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="540">And the German came into the <span class="populated place">village</span> and knew they will collect bread and butter and milk and meat, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="541">So we were putting ambushes -- ambush is that the right word? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: ...and they were taking away the food from them. </sentence><sentence id="570">And that's what we had the food for the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="571">We made ambush on them and got their rifles. </sentence><sentence id="572">We got everything from them. </sentence><sentence id="573">Nobody was sending us. </sentence><sentence id="574">They were killing the German. </sentence><sentence id="575">They took away the food, took away the rifles, and we were in business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="583">Q: Do you know about -- I think it was probably soon after you came -- the big harvest, when the Germans were going to get a percentage of the harvest, and so they burned the -- tell me about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: The <span class="populated place">villages</span> told us everything. </sentence><sentence id="586">Not us, to the Bielskis brother. </sentence><sentence id="587">They were afraid of them, terrible. </sentence><sentence id="588">One cannot fight, but if you three brothers, six-two with rifles and you knew you cannot live, you knew that he will touch something, whatever, you will not do the right thing, they will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="589">So they did everything. </sentence><sentence id="590">They were telling us that in a couple of days they have to pay to the German so much and so much. </sentence><sentence id="591">Not in money, but in food. </sentence><sentence id="592">So the Bielskis knew that the food is coming. </sentence><sentence id="593">The <span class="populated place">villages</span> are giving them. </sentence><sentence id="594">We need it, too, the food. </sentence><sentence id="595">So that's what we took away. </sentence><sentence id="596">That was the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="597">That's what you mean, right? </sentence><sentence id="598">And we took away and we told to the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, remember one thing, you giving them because you don't want, because Germans, too, they were killing them. </sentence><sentence id="599">They were killing them. </sentence><sentence id="600">They put everything on a fire and they went away. </sentence><sentence id="601">So you have to give them, half them and half to us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="602">And that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="603">They were not always friendly, because you see, there were Aktions. </sentence><sentence id="604">The <span class="building">Bielskis</span> were fighters. </sentence><sentence id="605">Not everybody, but they had a group of fighters. </sentence><sentence id="606">They had, the beginning, they had about 50 fighters. </sentence><sentence id="607">Later, the number went up and up and up. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="608">And they were not only fighting with the Polish police, they were fighting between the partisans, too. </sentence><sentence id="609">They were Polish -- not Polish, but German partisan -- German -- Russian partisans. </sentence><sentence id="610">They were against us, too. </sentence><sentence id="611">First of all, because we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="612">Second, because we knew better the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> and we knew the people. </sentence><sentence id="613">So this was a plus, a big plus for us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="614">And they were saying that we are taking away all of the food. </sentence><sentence id="615">Remember 1,000 people in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="616">You have to feed them. </sentence><sentence id="617">And they were not sitting all of them in one place. </sentence><sentence id="618">We had afraid for that. </sentence><sentence id="619">So in groups, this was about 20 people in groups, they were sitting in the  summertime up. </sentence><sentence id="620">In the wintertime, we had under the -- underground they were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="621">And when you are in the <span class="env feature">snow</span>, every little thing you can see. </sentence><sentence id="622">So we were very careful, but you know you cannot take away from the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">They knew very good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="624"> The Bielskis knew the place, but they knew, too. </sentence><sentence id="625">So we have to be in peace with them. </sentence><sentence id="626">You cannot take away everything. </sentence><sentence id="627">You have to leave them, too, for the family, something. </sentence><sentence id="628">But we managed. </sentence><sentence id="629">We managed. </sentence><sentence id="630">In the wintertime, I never were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">I was always -- it's called a <span class="building">hutor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="632">This mean a <span class="dlf">farm</span> from one <span class="building">house</span> or two <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="633">So I went with my husband and another 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="634">They were riders. </sentence><sentence id="635">And went there, sleep over about four or three hours and we went back to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">But they were very good to us. </sentence><sentence id="637">I cannot say it. </sentence><sentence id="638">Nobody would survive if not the people from the <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="639">They had afraid, but they give us whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="640">Later, already in -- this was in "43. </sentence><sentence id="641">In "44, we got already the rifles and everything from <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="642">They were sending us by <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="643">And they were bigger commanders than the <span

</sentence><sentence id="645">And they were good. </sentence><sentence id="646">They said to us like that. </sentence><sentence id="647">We were complaining always. </sentence><sentence id="648">You know, they have took a group of ours, 14 people. </sentence><sentence id="649">They took away their rifles, took away their food, and let them go without shoes even. </sentence><sentence id="650">They said, "Remember Mr. Bielski -- brother Bielski, remember one thing, this is life. </sentence><sentence id="651">You have to fight for them -- for that." </sentence><sentence id="652">Not once my husband -- My husband was always between the German and the Polish army. </sentence><sentence id="653">The Polish, they were working together with the German, the Kozaks. </sentence><sentence id="654">He was always on the horses. </sentence><sentence id="655">He was giving everything to the all partisan and from the <span class="building">Naliboki puszeza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="656">You know what is a <span class="populated place">puszcza</span>, <span class="populated place">puszcza</span> is the biggest <span class="env feature">forest</span>, you cannot live there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="657">This is only for the animals. </sentence><sentence id="658">This is not far from <span class="populated place">Novogrudok</span>. </sentence><sentence id="659">This was between <span class="populated place">Novogrudok</span> and <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="660">But we were there in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="661">And they couldn't find us because you have to go by foot or by horses. </sentence><sentence id="662">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="663">They cannot go with the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="664">They were surrounding us and we heard them talking and shooting. </sentence><sentence id="665">And we were sitting on <span class="env feature">mud</span> without food for 10, for 12 days, till my husband -- I am telling you everything in one story -- till my husband said, "They cannot take no more hunger." </sentence><sentence id="666">This was the only brother he said, "I cannot -- I have to go fight myself." </sentence><sentence id="667">So he took 150 people -- not 150, 90 people, and I was, too, in the group by my husband, and he opened the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="668">We come in after the German who saw the fire still burning. </sentence><sentence id="669">They were warming the food, but nobody touch it. </sentence><sentence id="670">When we went out to open the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, after a day, another 100 people went out and another hundred people because the Germans left us alone and we went away from there. </sentence><sentence id="671">And then we went to get organized again. </sentence><sentence id="672">This was the life. </sentence><sentence id="673">We were fighting them not in the open. </sentence><sentence id="674">You cannot fight a German soldier in the open. </sentence><sentence id="675">We were surrounding them. </sentence><sentence id="676">We know where they are and we were fighting them and took off everything from them. </sentence><sentence id="677">And that's what this was life of the partisan. </sentence><sentence id="678">Not only us, there were the Russian partisan. </sentence><sentence id="679">The same thing, they were fighting, not in the open <span class="dlf">field</span>, because in the open <span class="dlf">field</span> you got killed from them. </sentence><sentence id="680">They had better everything.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="768">Q: How do you think they knew that the only way to survive was to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="770">A: Their instinct, instinct. </sentence><sentence id="771">You know, when you are born in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, yes, you think that is the whole world. </sentence><sentence id="772">That is the whole world for them, for the people. </sentence><sentence id="773">They knew that if they would go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> they will get killed because once Tuvia got to the <span class="populated place">city</span> to take something and they took him. </sentence><sentence id="774">The German took him, hit him so, so much. </sentence><sentence id="775">And he -- I don't know how he survived. </sentence><sentence id="776">At night we were sitting, and he said, "What I am sitting? </sentence><sentence id="777">What am I waiting for?" </sentence><sentence id="778">And he ran away to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="779">The first in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> was my husband and his brother, Asael. </sentence><sentence id="780">How come the first? </sentence><sentence id="781">My husband, when the German came, he was in the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="782">They took him. </sentence><sentence id="783">You know, the Russian, when they came in "39, they were taking the young  0 people to the <span

id="787">whatever, they got killed. </sentence><sentence id="788">So he said "no." </sentence><sentence id="789">He was speaking very nicely Russian and speaks beautiful Polish. </sentence><sentence id="790">And He doesn't look like a Jew, he looks like a Russian. </sentence><sentence id="791">So he said that he will not get in the Russian -- in the German and that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="792">He came <span class="building">home</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="793">He was in <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> in the army there. </sentence><sentence id="794">He came at night. </sentence><sentence id="795">He was swollen in the legs and everything. </sentence><sentence id="796">So his mother said to him, "Stay for a couple of

</sentence><sentence id="808">She was married to the <span class="building">Dzienciolski</span>. </sentence><sentence id="809">When they heard about the German, the whole Dzienciolski family ran away and they left her with a small baby in the <span class="building">house</span>, the sister, Tajba. </sentence><sentence id="810">So my husband went and he took her out with the baby to the <span

watching and they didn't hear nothing. </sentence><sentence id="820">They were sure that the baby is already in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="821">They forgot about it. </sentence><sentence id="822">So the baby was already frozen when they took her into the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="823">And they took care on her. </sentence><sentence id="824">And they said, "God sent us a baby daughter." </sentence><sentence id="825">And they took care till after she was three years. </sentence><sentence id="826">They didn't
