<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5"> A My name is Amalie Petranker. </sentence><sentence id="6">Now it's <span class="populated place">Salsitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born October 21st, 1922 in <span class="populated place">Munich</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, but I was just born there. </sentence><sentence id="8">Why? </sentence><sentence id="9">It was an accident. </sentence><sentence id="10">My mother was visiting there, but I was raised, brought up and till "42 I lived in <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> (ph) which is now . </sentence><sentence id="11">It's very much to the southeast of <span class="country">Poland</span> as <span class="populated place">Landberg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="12"><span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> was considered a big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">It...a large <span class="populated place">city</span> with inhabitants a hundred thousand. </sentence><sentence id="14">From there forty thousand Jews, forty thousand Ukrainians, and twenty thousand Poles. </sentence><sentence id="15">Before the outbreak of the war, Polish government wanted to Polanize it, so they brought Poles from , from the <span class="dlf">German border</span> and they settled them in <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> in order to increase the Polish population. </sentence><sentence id="16">And <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span>, <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> was a modern <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">It became big after the 1st World War, has beautiful <span class="dlf">parks</span>, <span class="dlf">boulevards</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">Had many <span class="building">high schools</span> and each minority its own <span class="building">high school</span>, like the Jews had their <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">The Ukrainians had <span class="building">Ukrainian gymnasium</span>, and the Germans had a <span class="building">German gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="20">And naturally we had <span class="building">state gymnasiums</span> and there very few Jews were accepted. </sentence><sentence id="21">It was numerous classes, so means a certain number, only seven percentage of the students. </sentence><sentence id="22">Majority of Jews in <span class="country">Poland</span>, uh in <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> were progressive. </sentence><sentence id="23">We had a small nucleus of Hasidic (ph) Jews but they lived in this one <span class="region">section</span> which later became <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Tell us about your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: My family. </sentence><sentence id="49">My parents were very progressive. </sentence><sentence id="50">My father was a , a Zionist, who believed very much in education. </sentence><sentence id="51">He was very well rounded. </sentence><sentence id="52">He had the Jewish education and he was a graduate of <span class="building">Agriculture School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">For him, education was very important. </sentence><sentence id="54">My mother also was a graduate of the uh <span class="building">art (ph) school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">This was a <span class="building">German school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">Ten years. </sentence><sentence id="57">They have something like this now in <span class="populated place">Haifa</span>, in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">My mother went there. </sentence><sentence id="59">All the subjects were taught in German because most of my mother's family was in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so they wanted her to know. </sentence><sentence id="60">My fath...my father was a modern Jew, and his knowledge, especially in Judaic studies taught him well because he was in lumber business and the Jews didn't like to go with any every case to the <span class="building">court</span>, so they selected like judges, , and my father was selected to be a because he knew the Jewish law and because he was so educated. </sentence><sentence id="61">For him, or Hebrew scholars was just the same. </sentence><sentence id="62">He also had a hobby. </sentence><sentence id="63">He was a painter. </sentence><sentence id="64">And wha...this saved him when he was in the army because when he was in the Austrian army, Jews were just plain soldiers, and actually they used to be even orderlies (ph) to officers. </sentence><sentence id="65">They have to clean their boots. </sentence><sentence id="66">But because of his ability to draw he worked in an <span class="building">office</span> and he printed and drew the announcement proclamations that they needed. </sentence><sentence id="67">My father's family was quite well to do before the 1st World War, but after the war, when they were burned out, they had lumber business. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh they had uh uh <span class="building">brick factory</span>, and they had an <span class="building">inn</span>, but they lost a lot of money, so what remained is only education and this made a very deep impression on my late father. </sentence><sentence id="69">So having three daughters he said I will try to prepare for them dowry, but  I'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good education, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he would have foreseen what future would be. </sentence><sentence id="70">My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet woman. </sentence><sentence id="71">She was very young. </sentence><sentence id="72">She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one when my oldest sister, so she was like one of us. </sentence><sentence id="73">And maybe it's good she was easy- going, because my late father was like a Prussian officer. </sentence><sentence id="74">He didn't have any sons, so he actually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="75">He was fair but very demanding, so she in a way protected us. </sentence><sentence id="76">Sometimes when he was strict, she did. </sentence><sentence id="77">He demanded, but now I'm very grateful. </sentence><sentence id="78">At that time it was very hard on us, like for example, we attended <span class="building">private schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">He wanted us to be protected from being called kikes and Jews, so from the <span class="building">kindergarten</span>...we went to a <span class="building">Hebrew kindergarten</span> where all, we spoke only Hebrew...we went to <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> from the first grade to the sixth where all the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of course <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> because the language, prevalent language was Polish, but we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="80">My older one was <span class="building">Pepi</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="81">I was the middle one and my younger one was <span class="populated place">Teela</span> (ph) and we were just a year apart, so like first, second, third grade. </sentence><sentence id="82">Second, third and fourth. </sentence><sentence id="83">So we were called <span class="building">inschool</span> _, ; , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you know, and we looked alike. </sentence><sentence id="84">As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very much like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and unfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I was unhappy because in <span class="country">Europe</span> was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle and the middle to the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="86">In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't so pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not only what we had a lot of work in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was very demanding because it was very expensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the <span class="building">school</span>, would take us out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish and to cont...to go to <span class="building">medical school</span>, so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the only day off. </sentence><sentence id="88">Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time, every Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him , the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak (ph), and every Saturday, summer time, . </sentence><sentence id="89">At that time we resented it very much and I resented it very much and being the middle one, I had to show I am the best, so...because I was the smallest one...so uh then we were rewarded. </sentence><sentence id="90">Whoever knew got money, spending money to go to the <span class="building">movies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And God forbid if we didn't know what happened someplace to my older sister, so she was the pride of the spending money, for allowance, which was really a tragedy for her at that time. </sentence><sentence id="92">And you see also not only that we had to read books for <span class="building">school</span> for literature. </sentence><sentence id="93">My father assigned to us books and every Saturday we had to finish by Saturday and discussed. </sentence><sentence id="94">So education was very stressed. </sentence><sentence id="95">My mother was very active like in <span class="building">PTA</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">We had lunchtime...like every Tuesday she used to serve lunch in <span class="building">gymnasium</span> for us. </sentence><sentence id="97">I was very proud. </sentence><sentence id="98">She was a very pretty woman, on the heavy side with her beautiful smile, very pretty face. </sentence><sentence id="99">Now my father was in <span class="building">lumber business</span> but I think two, three years before the start of of the war, it was nationalized and our part by the government and it was called . </sentence><sentence id="100">Being my father was quite known  and prominent in lumber business, the director from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> came and told him, you cannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director, and he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on I'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival. </sentence><sentence id="101">As a rule, we were sheltered. </sentence><sentence id="102">We didn't have a lot to do with the Christian population. </sentence><sentence id="103">Actually each minority kept to itself. </sentence><sentence id="104">We didn't have too much problem. </sentence><sentence id="105">Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays, because other <span class="building">schools</span> were closed. </sentence><sentence id="106">Our <span class="building">school</span> was next to a <span class="building">church</span>, so this was a day free for them to throw stones on us. </sentence><sentence id="107">As children I resented it to be singled out. </sentence><sentence id="108">I was hurt. </sentence><sentence id="109">But this was something we couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="110">It...even when...it became so bad before the outbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an <span class="dlf">iron gate</span> around our <span class="building">school</span>...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our <span class="dlf">school yard</span> and to throw stone and to beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="111">In our <span class="populated place">town</span>, there were some incidents of anti-Semites, especially when there were students came from <span class="building">universities</span> at Christmas time and Easter and they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually very strong physically, the <span class="building">butchers</span>, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared and they used to take a <span class="spatial object">two-by-four</span> and fight back. </sentence><sentence id="112">They didn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="113">Now uh we had good relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities. </sentence><sentence id="114">So before the war, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late father needed for example a loan. </sentence><sentence id="115">He went, he got a loan from <span class="building">Ukrainian bank</span>, but not from the <span class="building">Bellish</span> (ph) uh, <span class="building">Polish bank</span>, from the <span class="building">state bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="116">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="117">We were three daughters. </sentence><sentence id="118">My <span class="building">house</span> always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of us came one friend. </sentence><sentence id="119">My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she was named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother, because my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother. </sentence><sentence id="120">We were very close friends and this was through the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="121">And also I was very close to my younger sister. </sentence><sentence id="122">We loved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure that she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when Malia will get married. </sentence><sentence id="123">With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference between us, but my older didn't want to bother with us. </sentence><sentence id="124">She went with other friends. </sentence><sentence id="125">And we had beautiful <span class="dlf">parks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">We participated. </sentence><sentence id="127">We used to go to <span class="populated place">summer camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">Wintertime, the winter vacation. </sentence><sentence id="129">We went skiing. </sentence><sentence id="130">We had pretty normal, happy life. </sentence><sentence id="131">It's true it was not the life of all the Jews in my <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">There was a select group, <span class="region">middle</span> and above which could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="133">There were poor Jews. </sentence><sentence id="134">There were Jews who after the mandatory six grades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl. </sentence><sentence id="135">I would say there are some very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="136">We had some magnets (ph) like , very very rich who donated <span class="spatial object">planes</span> to the government. </sentence><sentence id="137">Majority barely eked out a living, but was a group like my parents, middle and above, who were quite comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="138">This was un...until the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="139">In "31, in September, broke out the German war, uh the World War, but we had... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: You mean "31... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: "39. </sentence><sentence id="236">At that time I was not even seventeen years old. </sentence><sentence id="237">First, "39, after a few weeks, we read a proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army  will come for order and safety of the <span class="populated place">city</span> "till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate. </sentence><sentence id="238">So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few Jews were killed. </sentence><sentence id="239">Some <span class="building">buildings</span> were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="240">But this was at the beginning, in "39, September. </sentence><sentence id="241">The Russians came to our <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">They occupied it. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was not for time being like we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="244">We didn't know what to expect. </sentence><sentence id="245">So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding. </sentence><sentence id="246">So we stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in <span class="country">Russian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">When we questioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so we, so some just asked and tell me...how about ; . </sentence><sentence id="248">Do you have a lot of ? </sentence><sentence id="249">And they said no, . </sentence><sentence id="250">So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not true. </sentence><sentence id="251">Our life changed drastically. </sentence><sentence id="252">Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called bourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we were any moment destined to be shipped to <span class="region">Siberia</span>, and in a way I wish it would happened. </sentence><sentence id="253">Maybe my parents would survive. </sentence><sentence id="254">And also, I was at that time, I graduated from first . </sentence><sentence id="255">| was supposed to go to the second and graduate. </sentence><sentence id="256">So they entered it, and the ten-year system they call it, the <span class="building">class</span>, and the standard of learning and living changed. </sentence><sentence id="257">Like my foreign language was English. </sentence><sentence id="258">This is why I have such an accent even now, because I learned in the <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, but for them learning languages...I mean unless you're in <span class="building">special school</span>, was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for comprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare. </sentence><sentence id="259">Lowered the standard. </sentence><sentence id="260">But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard. </sentence><sentence id="261">But the problem is immediately they developed , with <span class="building">political departments</span>, and each student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless you report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined. </sentence><sentence id="262">Always threatened. </sentence><sentence id="263">And then we saw our <span class="building">schoolmates</span> suddenly taken in by . </sentence><sentence id="264">They had special <span class="spatial object">cars</span> which they took away. </sentence><sentence id="265">This installed fear in us. </sentence><sentence id="266">My father, who was a government high official, was in business, suddenly became a laborer. </sentence><sentence id="267">And I was accepted to <span class="building">institute</span> they call it. </sentence><sentence id="268">They didn't want to take me to the <span class="building">medical school</span>, but they were short in teachers, so they expec...uh accepted me to <span class="building">Institute</span> they call it, . </sentence><sentence id="269">Means math and physics. </sentence><sentence id="270">After four months, I was called in. </sentence><sentence id="271">I was told because you cannot get a stipendum (ph) because each student got a <span class="spatial object">stipendum</span> that he could sustain himself and could study. </sentence><sentence id="272">You cannot because you're bourgeois but if you pay us six hundred rubles a month, you can continue. </sentence><sentence id="273">At that time my father earned only two hundred rubles, so naturally it was out for me. </sentence><sentence id="274">Also we lived in fear that any time they will ship us to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">One thing saved us. </sentence><sentence id="276">Where our <span class="building">house</span>, it was actually our <span class="building">condominium</span>, this was assigned each <span class="region">section</span> was assigned to different branch of government. </sentence><sentence id="277">Our <span class="region">section</span> was assigned to <span class="building">rail authorities</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="278">Means they could take over any <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for their workers, officials that they have chosen. </sentence><sentence id="279">Our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> were assigned to a Russian engineer. </sentence><sentence id="280">When he came to take it over, my sis...my younger sister was present, and when he saw my sister...she was very beautiful and li...little on the heavy side. </sentence><sentence id="281">He said he cannot throw my sister out. </sentence><sentence id="282">He put his name on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, and my sister saved that <span class="interior space">apartment</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="283">But it was very important, because we didn't have any other address and he lived on this one, so means they couldn't ship us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="284">We were not registered. </sentence><sentence id="285">See my older sister, she got married in "31, with a Pales...Palestinian  from my <span class="populated place">town</span> who came for vacation and met her. </sentence><sentence id="286">He was eleven years her senior. </sentence><sentence id="287">He fell in love with her. </sentence><sentence id="288">They were in a <span class="building">resort</span> and he wanted to marry her. </sentence><sentence id="289">The war broke out, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged. </sentence><sentence id="290">After the war I will come back. </sentence><sentence id="291">I will marry you. </sentence><sentence id="292">Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="293">My sister had chosen to get married. </sentence><sentence id="294">My parents didn't approve. </sentence><sentence id="295">She was only eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's brother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in <span class="country">Palestine</span>, so she explained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they permitted. </sentence><sentence id="296">I'll never forget the day when she left. </sentence><sentence id="297">First of all, we were never separated, and like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have a premonition. </sentence><sentence id="298">She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known this was the last time that she sees her. ( </sentence><sentence id="299">crying) So my sister left for <span class="country">Palestine</span> and my family was my parents, my younger sister and I. When the Russo (ph) German war broke out in "41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , Means permit to evacuate with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="300">I came <span class="building">home</span> with this, and I presented it to my parents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="301">You are not leaving the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="302">You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us. </sentence><sentence id="303">And my mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War. </sentence><sentence id="304">They are civilized people. </sentence><sentence id="305">I don't believe the atrocities that we hear. </sentence><sentence id="306">This must be Russian propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="307">We are staying put in the place. </sentence><sentence id="308">So, I was supposed to leave with my boyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the <span class="building">railroad authority</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called . </sentence><sentence id="310">This was the highest official, but he has a special <span class="spatial object">car</span> for himself on the <span class="dlf">line</span> from my <span class="populated place">town</span> to the <span class="dlf">border</span>, so we could have escaped. </sentence><sentence id="311">He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who by the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our parents don't want. </sentence><sentence id="312">But my father forbade me. </sentence><sentence id="313">So when the Ru...Russo-German war broke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="314">The Hungarian army entered my <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Stanistlawow</span> or . </sentence><sentence id="315">The Hungarians were very were good to us and again, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="316">They were supposed to requisition <span class="building">apartments</span>. </sentence><sentence id="317">Being our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> was like on the <span class="dlf">5th Avenue</span>, ours was supposed to requisition, be requisitioned, and came a Hungarian graf (ph), Count , with his adjutant. </sentence><sentence id="318">This time I saved the situation. </sentence><sentence id="319">He liked me, so he decided he's not going to take it. </sentence><sentence id="320">He stayed in the <span class="building">hotel</span>, but he put his name on our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and he started courting me. </sentence><sentence id="321">I was eighteen only. </sentence><sentence id="322">Flowers, and food was scarce so he ate in our <span class="building">house</span> so we would be able to have meal together. </sentence><sentence id="323">Was even one situation unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="324">Uh they had a spy, a Hungarian young man, extremely handsome, whom they used to draft in <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="325">They had spy uh housekeeper for one very important uh lord or something, and he spied for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="326">So the count said that he has to invite him too. </sentence><sentence id="327">He'll come to our <span class="building">house</span>, but we should be very careful not to disclose that we are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="328">And he told us about his uh deeds, what he had done and how he worked in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">The Count told my father that he knows that our fate is sealed and it's very set. </sentence><sentence id="330">They are going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="331">He told my father I cannot save you all, but he would like to save me, so he proposed that I should embrace Christianity and he will marry me and he will smuggle me to <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="332">My father expressed his gratitude and he said as a family he would like to stay together. </sentence><sentence id="333">He appreciates it and in a way he  declined it. </sentence><sentence id="334">I couldn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="335">Not that I loved him but he...[ was impressed. __ </sentence><sentence id="336">ten years old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were assigned for slave labor with the army. </sentence><sentence id="337">Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his friend before the war. </sentence><sentence id="338">Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="339">So even the Baron Moore talked to my father. </sentence><sentence

tolerate it, anditmay bea___ unto your daughter. </sentence><sentence id="343">You're very smart, but my father didn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me. </sentence><sentence id="344">He stated the reason that even I understood is right at that time. </sentence><sentence id="345">Meantime, this was...they were shipped to <span class="country">Russia</span>, to fight in <span class="country">Russia</span>, and the Germans entered. </sentence><sentence id="346">At that time, they shipped Russian, uh Hungarian Jews to our <span class="populated place">town</span>, and when the Germans entered, they kept the Jews on . </sentence><sentence id="347">It was a big <span class="building">mill house</span> uh and they were kept there. </sentence><sentence id="348">When the Germans came, immediately they ordered us to wear the bands with the star, after age I think twelve, and they ordered all the Jews to register. </sentence><sentence id="349">Specially the first to register, they ordered the teachers...the professional people. </sentence><sentence id="350">So the Jewish , which took care of the Jewish life before the war, told them to register, so the Poles should be able to get jobs. </sentence><sentence id="351">They never returned from the meeting where they were called to a meeting. </sentence><sentence id="352">This was the first. </sentence><sentence id="353">Then we all had to register, according to the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and we specially from <span class="dlf">5th Avenue</span>, from the nice <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span>, were assigned as cleaning girls to the <span class="building">Gestapo building</span> to scrip, to scrub the <span class="interior space">floors</span> and the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> with our hands. </sentence><sentence id="354">We had to wear scrub brushes, <span class="spatial object">pails</span>, and we were assigned. </sentence><sentence id="355">One day when I was assigned there...it was just after a week my sister was assigned, my best friend Junior was assigned to work, and we...when once we came there we had uh __ lady who was German, ethnic German, means born in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and she was the supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="356">One day, a Gestapo man came and he pointed to me and to another girl to step out of the <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">The supervisor was once a neighbor of mine, because when we were young, we lived in the <span class="populated place">German suburbs</span>...was beautiful, out of <span class="populated place">town</span> and only two Jewish families lived there. </sentence><sentence id="358">Family Sweik (ph) who owned a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and me, and we. </sentence><sentence id="359">She knew us by sight because this was at least I would say to "35 so means I was uh twelve, thirteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="360">When he called me out, to step out and this girl...this girl was a refugee from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, Vita Sh , a beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="361">She was sure that he wants to kill us, to shoot us so she said that we are good workers, decent workers. </sentence><sentence id="362">We should be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="363">So he slapped her on the face. </sentence><sentence id="364">He didn't know that she's aunt of the two brothers, Mueller (ph) who are, were very sadistic and very big off...high officers in the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="365">He thought that she's Polish only. </sentence><sentence id="366">So she advised me not...and he, so he told us to report to the <span class="interior space">private quarters</span> where they just moved in to clean the <span class="interior space">apartments</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="367">She advited...advised us not to report to work. </sentence><sentence id="368">She would protect us in order he should forget, because she still didn't trust him what he will do to us. </sentence><sentence id="369">So a few days later, when we reported back, we had to clean the <span class="building">buildings</span> and he spotted me through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, and he called me in and this Vita Sh . </sentence><sentence id="370">He called me. </sentence><sentence id="371">He started questioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work, to be responsible for this <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">I'll never forget the picture of my sister with a group waiting outside and crying because she thought this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="373">At that time I was responsible for cleaning this particu...his <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and Vita Sh was responsible for cleaning another <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">Meanwhile responsible because then they sent from the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, uh  from the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the professionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">And my sister still remained in the main <span class="building">building</span> to clean. </sentence><sentence id="376">You know, the Jews from <span class="country">Hungary</span> were sitting there in the <span class="interior space">coal (ph) yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">They brought them from the <span class="building">mill</span>, from , to the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> of the Gestapo, and they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="378">They were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="379">They were tired. </sentence><sentence id="380">They were beaten, with children. </sentence><sentence id="381">They were there. </sentence><sentence id="382">My sister went to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work and for me, she dropped through the <span class="dlf">window</span> for them to eat. </sentence><sentence id="383">A Gestapo officer noticed it, and he brought her down to there. </sentence><sentence id="384">Since then I have never seen her. </sentence><sentence id="385">She started to cry, and there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should notify me, who can talk that I can do something for her. </sentence><sentence id="386">This is a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="387">Then they take her out. </sentence><sentence id="388">I tried. </sentence><sentence id="389">So there were Gestapo who took me out of the <span class="dlf">line</span>, he was in charge and when I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe he will listen to me, and I forgot in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> we were told not to wear the armbands. </sentence><sentence id="390">When he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="391">So you're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="392">And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a band. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'll shoot you too. </sentence><sentence id="394">Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band. </sentence><sentence id="395">He let me go...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="396">The Gestapo, how cruel he was. </sentence><sentence id="397">He kept telling me and his fiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that they took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field hands. </sentence><sentence id="398">After fall, they will release her. </sentence><sentence id="399">So, I came <span class="building">home</span> and I had to bring the news to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="400">Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I was very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother. </sentence><sentence id="401">My mother was only forty years old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day. </sentence><sentence id="402">And we still believed...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="403">Meantime we saw shooting on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, random shooting. </sentence><sentence id="404">They took the Jews and to work on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="405">They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig <span class="dlf">ditches</span> or to work at <span class="dlf">bridges</span> and then sometimes they used to throw them into the <span class="env feature">river</span> and Russians erected many <span class="spatial object">monuments</span> so they took the Jews to destroy the <span class="spatial object">monuments</span>, and many of them were shot. </sentence><sentence id="406">They didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="407">This was going on till around, till September, and I still work at that time by this <span class="building">Gestapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="408">Then we were told that we will have to leave our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and to move to a <span class="region">section</span> which was designated as <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="409">This was the <span class="region">poorest section</span> of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="410">Being...again we lived like on the <span class="dlf">5th Avenue</span>, my parents secured immediately an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the future <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move. </sentence><sentence id="411">We transferred our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="412">We still kept only a <span class="spatial object">mattress</span>, the essential thing in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and on...while we lived on <span class="populated place">35</span>, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move. </sentence><sentence id="413">Then suddenly, on , October the 12th, we were in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which almost was bare and it was a large <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="414">Only the <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> and some <span class="spatial object">utensils</span>. </sentence><sentence id="415">We heard terrible commotion and noise. </sentence><sentence id="416">I went out on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> and I saw a lot of Gestapo and Ukrainian police. </sentence><sentence id="417">We knew something is brewing, something bad is going...will happen, but neither what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="418">We thought that maybe now they will gather the Jewish men like have done with the Hungarian men that they brought to us, to break us economically so means only  the men are in danger. </sentence><sentence id="419">So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the <span class="interior space">attics</span>. </sentence><sentence id="420">Each <span class="building">condominium</span>, <span class="building">condominium</span> had it's own part of the <span class="interior space">attic</span> and it's own part in the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>, so we have hidden my father on the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="421">My mother got the key. </sentence><sentence id="422">And after an hour, my mother's cousin who lived...also owned a <span class="building">condominium</span> in this <span class="building">complex</span> came and said look, it's very unsafe to stay in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="423">Let's all go to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> and let's hide there, and this was a <span class="building">house</span> like a <span class="dlf">facade</span> (ph)...many <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">She thought it's safe there. </sentence><sentence id="425">I really never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents. </sentence><sentence id="426">I refused to go with her down to the <span class="interior space">cellar</span> with the family and other Jewish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="427">Only one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she had, she had also hidden her husband. </sentence><sentence id="428">She decided to stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="429">My reasoning was they will come in. </sentence><sentence id="430">They will see empty <span class="interior space">rooms</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">They will not enter the last <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="432">This is how my reasoning went, and I refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="433">I stayed with her in the, in our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">We heard...we heard cries. </sentence><sentence id="435">We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming. </sentence><sentence id="436">By noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the <span class="dlf">door</span>, <span class="populated place">Rister</span> (ph), and he said your mother would like you very much to come. </sentence><sentence id="437">Please don't be stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="438">Again, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="439">I don't know why I was so stubborn. </sentence><sentence id="440">I can't explain to today. </sentence><sentence id="441">I refused to come down. </sentence><sentence id="442">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="443">Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to venture in the <span class="interior space">hall</span> and to find out what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="444">Our Christian neighbors said, you are here. </sentence><sentence id="445">They took everybody from the <span class="interior space">cellar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="446">They loaded them on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they took them to the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="447">It was a terrible shock. </sentence><sentence id="448">I didn't know how to act. </sentence><sentence id="449">But I still didn't suspect that this was for killing. </sentence><sentence id="450">This was the first time. </sentence><sentence id="451">So I thought maybe this is the <span class="populated place">gathering place</span>, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother. </sentence><sentence id="452">Finally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out. </sentence><sentence id="453">Before we managed to go, my neighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came . </sentence><sentence id="454">Straight hair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">My mother was crying on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> when she saw the direction, and she said they're taking us to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="456">Why didn't I listen to <span class="populated place">Malia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">My parents called me Malia. </sentence><sentence id="458">At the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>...first of all they told them to sit down in rows and they sent Jewish girls, young girls, to pick up all the jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="459">And there was a <span class="spatial object">board</span> and they shot...even if people were killed or not, they fell to the <span class="dlf">ditch</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">They collected thirty thousand Jews on this day. </sentence><sentence id="461">My mother was with her cousin and they took my mother's cousin. </sentence><sentence id="462">So the cousin said to my mother, I can't witness this. </sentence><sentence id="463">So my mother said you are right. </sentence><sentence id="464">Let's move closer. </sentence><sentence id="465">We'll be spared to witness the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="466">Let's be shot. </sentence><sentence id="467">She didn't know that when it became dark, the Gestapo announced whoever is alive can go back to his <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">But my mother was not there anymore to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="469">So this how my sister and my mother were gone. ( </sentence><sentence id="470">crying) My father and I remained <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="471">And now they shot fifteen thousand Jews on this day. </sentence><sentence id="472">This was . </sentence><sentence id="473">This was my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="474">On the Jewish calendar, . </sentence><sentence id="475">Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday on the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family, my father and I was left. </sentence><sentence id="476">Now we had to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="477">For two people we couldn't have an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">They assigned ten people per <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="479">My mother had a step-sister. </sentence><sentence id="480">Her name was Clara Hoot (ph).Actually I would say she was poor. </sentence><sentence id="481">They were not so close, but the goodness and the best was coming out and there were bad times. </sentence><sentence id="482">She lived where the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was supposed to be, so she approached my father and said, you're only two people. </sentence><sentence id="483">Why should you be  assigned to strangers? </sentence><sentence id="484">We are five people. </sentence><sentence id="485">We have only a <span class="interior space">room</span> and a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="486">We'll take you in. </sentence><sentence id="487">And she was to me like a mother. ( </sentence><sentence id="488">crying) Till today, you know, I felt so guilty that we didn't treat them like really aunt should be treated. </sentence><sentence id="489">How good she was, and we stayed with her. </sentence><sentence id="490">Her husband maked tops of the shoes and this was very good because the Germans liked boots so there was a German cobbler who used to bring the materials he should make it. </sentence><sentence id="491">For this he got food, so he was also sustaining us, helping us with food where others were starving. </sentence><sentence id="492">The life in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="493">Many of my schoolmates, rich people, wealthy people...I will never forget the face, for example, from one other , only child, so spoiled...his father was the head of the Juden (ph), uh Jewish __, not Juden...and laying on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> swollen. </sentence><sentence id="494">The next day from hunger water came out, and this the picture. </sentence><sentence id="495">You saw, you knew the people starving to death, and you couldn't even share and give them. </sentence><sentence id="496">So my father learned that if he is assigned as a slave laborer out of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food, whatever...bread was really very hard to get. </sentence><sentence id="497">So with his connections, he was able to get a job on the <span class="dlf">railroad</span> as as slave worker, and then he tried for me to get a job too, because my father said, being we two are left, let's not ever separate. </sentence><sentence id="498">Let's always be together. </sentence><sentence id="499">Meantime my uncle died in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="500">My Uncle Dabbie Toot (ph), he died a natural death. </sentence><sentence id="501">His son, Jacob, was taking It's forced labor . </sentence><sentence id="502">His daughter was taken away from the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="503">She was very beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="504">They collected hundred of beautiful...hundred beautiful Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="505">They disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="506">We don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="507">So only my Aunt Clara, her daughter Pepi (ph) who's named like my sister Pepi (ph), and the oldest son who also got the job to make tops for the German cobbler Gross (ph)...1 remember his name...he remained. </sentence><sentence id="508">And one day my father said to me, you know what. </sentence><sentence id="509">We have to escape from <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="510">My father had so-called iron (ph) luck (ph). </sentence><sentence id="511">Spoke Polish well. </sentence><sentence id="512">So he decided that we'll try to get to the <span class="region">Iron side</span> and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will harbor us, will help us. </sentence><sentence id="513">We didn't think farther, just first to go out. </sentence><sentence id="514">So he dressed himself with few <span class="spatial object">suits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="515">He divided the money that we have. </sentence><sentence id="516">He gave me some few thousand and we were supposed to go out from <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and try our luck. </sentence><sentence id="517">And he said let me go first. </sentence><sentence id="518">If I succeed, then you go. </sentence><sentence id="519">I waited. </sentence><sentence id="520">After five minutes he came back, beaten up by the Ukrainian police. </sentence><sentence id="521">Luckily he had the money, because if not he would be shot, but they took away his suits and the money and they pushed him back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="522">So our escape was foiled. </sentence><sentence id="523">Meantime they will have killings in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="524">You know, they assigned the Jews, classified the Jews, just to find excuse for each killing which they call an aktion. </sentence><sentence id="525">First were the children. </sentence><sentence id="526">Then were all the old people. </sentence><sentence id="527">Then were people who were sick, people who couldn't work, so was A, B, C classification. </sentence><sentence id="528">One day we got classification of A - means we don't have to be afraid because we are working, right?

</sentence><sentence id="579">And nothing will happen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from outside, the slave workers in to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="580">It's dark. </sentence><sentence id="581">Meantime they came to look in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> with the dog, and the Germans said, is here, rouse (ph), and they leaved uh left the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="582">So I was so happy. </sentence><sentence id="583">I said at least my father is safe. </sentence><sentence id="584">When it's dark he will return to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and we will be united. </sentence><sentence id="585">It's night. </sentence><sentence id="586">My father is not there. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I decided, sick or not sick, I have to go next day to work...you see, because we used to march, and they guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners, and I'll find out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="588">Before even I came to work, my Christian acquaintance was standing behind the <span class="dlf">gate</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and she said, don't look for your father. </sentence><sentence id="589">They took all the Jews from outside to be shipped to be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="590">So I somehow, knowing my father I knew he will do everything not to let himself be shipped to the gas. </sentence><sentence id="591">And meantime what I didn't mention, once when there was such killing and we knew we all had Cate...Category A means we're exempt from shooting, we stayed in <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="592">At that time my Aunt Clara was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="593">Her daughter Pepi was alive, my father and I.

( )..-he hit my father very hard and I saw tears from my father's eyes, so I started to cry bitterly. </sentence><sentence id="605">This convinced them that this is my father. </sentence><sentence id="606">So they permitted him to go with me, and then I said on my aunt, this is my mother. </sentence><sentence id="607">I will never know why they let me go, but they let go. . </sentence><sentence

class="dlf">cemetery</span>, in the back. </sentence><sentence id="613">She was just walking. </sentence><sentence id="614">So it was willful killing. </sentence><sentence id="615">It was not that she was caught in the aktion. </sentence><sentence id="616">This kind of guy he was. </sentence><sentence id="617">So maybe I was destined to live, and this what happened. </sentence><sentence id="618">So coming back to this, when I lost my father, I was left alone. </sentence><sentence id="619">The German shoemaker kept my cousin and he kept him in his <span class="interior

will help me and he told me that he helped ten other, other Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="627">I will tell you what happened, or maybe I should tell you right now. </sentence><sentence id="628">I was the only one who who didn't blend into the Slavic population because I don't have the high Slavic cheekbones and my eyes were considered very Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="629">The other girls were all typical so-called Aryan looks, blonde, blue eyes and from the eleven, I am the only one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="630">Because I knew that I don't look Slavic, I could pass somehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the <span class="dlf">lion's den</span> so I worked for <span class="building">German companies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="631">I will explain later what I have done, and they were so sure that they would not be recognized so they worked in <span class="building">Polish companies</span> and normally they were beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="632">They were approached by Poles to date, and when they refused...maybe they said it jokingly...you must be a Jewish...and the sudden fear in their eyes gave them out and the Poles denounced them. </sentence><sentence id="633">I was the only one. </sentence><sentence id="634">So one day he propo...offered me this while still my father was alive. </sentence><sentence

he didn't succeed to jump from the running <span class="spatial object">train</span> and poor one (ph), he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="638">So one day he came and he told me according to my

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1067">A: So Edmund Abraham Ovitch, he told me to stay, that I shouldn't go back, and I slept on the <span class="building">railroad station</span> in the office of the Chief . </sentence><sentence id="1068">After the War, I found out how he arranged it, and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is, that he really wants to save my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the tracks because if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away, and I boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to , half hour ride. </sentence><sentence id="1069">But I didn't want to sit next to <span class="populated place">Mundig</span> because I felt if I'm caught, why should he loose his life. </sentence><sentence id="1070">So I sat by myself and there were workers, maybe about thirty, coming back from work. </sentence><sentence id="1071">They all knew me because if I should present it because like all white and one . </sentence><sentence id="1072">| was there with the arm band so they saw me everyday so they knew me, and like in every <span class="spatial object">train</span> the police came and the German police came. </sentence><sentence id="1073">On every <span class="spatial object">train</span> was a Gestapo police, checked the passengers. </sentence><sentence id="1074">When I...before they were supposed to approach me I must have been in terrible fear. </sentence><sentence id="1075">I can't explain why the workers gave me a sign with their eyes not to fear, that they will not give me away. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Where they were so eager to denounce others, I was destined to live. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And the police came. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I didn't have any papers. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I was afraid, but the German police sat next to me and discussed the weather, how beautiful it is, and he left. </sentence><sentence id="1080">So safely I arrived to Mundig's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1081">His mother was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I don't blame her, because I endangered her and the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="1083">On top of it without any reward. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I didn't have even money to pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="1085">She resented and she made it clear to me, so the son promised her that whenever he can find for me a safe haven, I will leave. </sentence><sentence id="1086">As a matter of face, even she refused me the meals. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Again I don't blame because it was very hard to get food, so the son, to make sure that I am eating, demanded that I should eat with him the dinner together. </sentence><sentence id="1088">But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that I omitted. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I think it's very important. </sentence><sentence id="1090">You see, the Germans, when their wives came to visit them from <span class="country">Germany</span>, their pleasure was to show the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> like we'll be animals in the <span class="building">zoo</span> and they used to take them and parade them through the main <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1091">So one day parading them and looking at them, at us Jews like animals, one Jew...1 forgot his last name...Joseph...by the way, he's alive...he's now in the <span class="country">United States</span>...when they were gaping at us, he spate on the Germans and run away. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Immediately the Gestapo came to the Juden__ and they gave, and at that time the president of <span class="populated place">Juden___</span> was Goldstein, and he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings (ph), means the Jewish police, and every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged, but he needed the rope to hang them, so he said first that the Juden , the president should decide which ones will step out. </sentence><sentence id="1093">He said I cannot do it, Mr. Goldstein said. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I'm not God. </sentence><sentence id="1095">I will not do it. </sentence><sentence id="1096">He should bring rope. </sentence><sentence id="1097">He didn't want to bring rope, so they sent somebody else and they hanged the head of the Juden , Mr. Goldstein with every ten police...uh Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="1098">One of them married my schoolmate, Eddie Fraley (ph), and he, when they hanged him, the rope broke down and he escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1099">They let him escape because they thought that they will get him another time. </sentence><sentence id="1100">But they didn't and actually he escaped from <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1101">He looked very much like a gentile. </sentence><sentence id="1102">He escaped to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> he was  4 one of the chief officers from the <span class="interior space">underground</span> . </sentence><sentence id="1103">He survived with my <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1145">Q: How many were killed altogether? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: Hundred (ph), and they were hanging. </sentence><sentence id="1148">This wasn't over for the whole week, for everyone in <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1150">Not enough that they were shooting us. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They were hanging...after a a week, they removed them, and you know, they couldn't find the commandant, uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police. </sentence><sentence id="1152">They wanted a hi...a Polish officer. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They wanted that he should have been a pol...an army officer, so they brought a Kariate from , whose family was in . </sentence><sentence id="1154">In <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> they gave him a Jewish name, uh a Mr. , and after that he left by <span class="spatial object">train</span> back to his family. </sentence><sentence id="1155">He joined his family. </sentence><sentence id="1156">This also I found out after I escaped from <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> from, uh from <span class="populated place">Mundig</span> I called him, this Abraham Mundig, Abraham Ovitch. </sentence><sentence id="1157">He told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Now when we were in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and I was left alone and it was cold... didn't have any firewood. </sentence><sentence id="1159">Some of our <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> was in uh in a <span class="building">shack</span>, so I took a <span class="spatial object">chair</span> and I wanted with a hammer to break into firewood but I wasn't handy so I just had to break it. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I cut myself next to my ankle and I was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Later sets uh set in <span class="dlf">puss</span> (ph) but I couldn't do anything because no doctors, no medication and this how I walked. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Again, why I didn't die on gangrene and when it was cured, it's again a question. </sentence><sentence id="1163">So coming back to <span class="populated place">Mundig</span>, being I was persona non gratia, parents didn't want...my...uh his mother didn't want me, I couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So II told Mundig...that uh I cannot stay there, so he found me a place to hide by a Ukrainian peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Ukrainian peasant had beautiful daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1166">A lot of Ukrainian militiamen used to come to visit her, and every time | had to run in the <span class="interior

</sentence><sentence id="1168">But while, while I was in a month later, Edmund Abraham Ovitch told me have to tell you some very sad. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And brace yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1170">Your father jumped from the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span> by prying off the boards from the <span class="interior space">floor</span> of the <span class="spatial object">cattle car</span>, although they were pressed like sardines, and he lifted the board and he asked who would like to jump with him, because more than that cannot be to let themselves down from the running <span class="spatial object">train</span> and run for their life. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Only one girl...she was from ...I don't know her name...my age...wanted to go with my father. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I guess the rest didn't want to separate. </sentence><sentence id="1173">Sometimes there were families together. </sentence><sentence id="1174">They wanted to die together. </sentence><sentence id="1175">My father let themselves down. </sentence><sentence id="1176">He got only bruised knees. </sentence><sentence id="1177">The girl was not harmed at all. </sentence><sentence id="1178">He walked to our <span class="populated place">village</span>, which was half-hour walking distance where I was in and he entered a Ukrainian peasant's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1179">There was only a woman. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Her husband was still in the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="1181">She...it was harvest time. </sentence><sentence id="1182">She needed field hands. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Without questioning my father, she took in my father and the girl, the girl posing as a daughter of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1184">He tried to get in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="1185">He couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1186">He didn't get any response. </sentence><sentence id="1187">He couldn't live with the thought that his sheltered daughter is alone in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">He decided to board the <span class="spatial object">train</span> which is certain death penalty for any Jew who boarded the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, to go back to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to look for me. </sentence><sentence id="1189">On the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was an architect, a Ukrainian who used to buy lumber from my father, who was wined and dined in our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Without any reward he went to the Gestapo...each <span class="spatial object">train</span> I told you was a  5 and a Gestapo...and said I know this man. </sentence><sentence id="1191">This is <span class="building">Dabbie Petranka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1192">He's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1193">They took him off the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1194">They brought him to the <span class="building">mill</span> on where they gathered the Jews already to be shipped to the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1195">My father probably tried to get in touch with me, but I was not there. </sentence><sentence id="1196">So I'm alive, but my father was killed. ( </sentence><sentence id="1197">crying) So this is my story. </sentence><sentence id="1198">So when I didn't want to stay by the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, by Ukrainian farmer, Mundig said to me, I'll get you a false labor certificate. </sentence><sentence id="1199">You should have some document. </sentence><sentence id="1200">His friend, a big anti-Semite that off-hand I don't remember his name...in my book that I am writing which will be published in November...I, at that time I still remembered. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I don't remember now. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I know only that he was a student, second <span class="building">gymnasium</span> which was known for the biggest anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="1203">He was the director of , Scrap iron (ph) and it was very important during the War because they needed it, so he gave me a certificate that I'm employed in his <span class="building">company</span> under assumed name. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Now I had to choose my name. </sentence><sentence id="1205">My actually name was Amalia Petrankia but I'm not Jewish and not German, but everything was very important to be able to blend into the population. </sentence><sentence id="1206">First impression's very important. </sentence><sentence id="1207">My "r" is a French and German, but not a Slavic, and this was very dangerous, so I picked the name Felicita (ph) which means in Latin black, felicita and I picked the name of Mewycheski who was my beloved uh writer. </sentence><sentence id="1208">You see we didn't have heros baseball, basketball, ballerinas...we had writers, and she was from <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> (ph) so he put...he made a certificate that I am Mewycheski, Felicita. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I was careful to keep my birthdate, because when you are under stress, this is the first thing that you forget...dates...and I gave my real...only my birthplace was <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, and now I became Felicita Mewycheski. </sentence><sentence id="1210">With this, <span class="building">Mundig</span> took me to where I thought being it's a big <span class="populated place">city</span>, <span class="populated place">metropolitan city</span>, I will be able to get lost there. </sentence><sentence id="1211">He took me to his cousin's, first cousin's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which was just a <span class="interior space">studio apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Turn out his cousin was the king of the <span class="building">black market</span>, the king of the underworld. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And they had only two <span class="spatial object">beds</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1216">I was supposed to sleep with Edmund on the other, and there were terrible, provocative remarks from him. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Mundig understood it's not for me, so he found me a place in a <span class="building">hostel</span>...this was...you see wives of Polish officers unable to be able to sustain themselves...they rented one <span class="interior

</sentence><sentence id="1218">How little did I know that this is the day when they're closing the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in and they were searching in every <span

the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Then she opened it again and she pulled me in, and I said I am Amalia Petranka, David's daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1393">She started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="1394">She embraced me and she said look, I didn't recognize you. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Let's see if my husband will recognize you. </sentence><sentence id="1396">If he doesn't, so maybe we can harbor you for a while till we'll find something for you. </sentence><sentence id="1397">Her husband came. </sentence><sentence id="1398">He didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="1399">She told him who I am. </sentence><sentence id="1400">So he said, I hate Jews, but for the daughter of David Petranka, I'll do every thing. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Let's see what we can do for her. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Now this was the high life of <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Every night <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, different companies, and being she was Armenian...again the Germans considered her a foreigner and she lived in a beautiful <span

</sentence><sentence id="1407">I got the job. </sentence><sentence id="1408">The Germans liked me because they got a maid, you know, from...a peasant girl who didn't understand German. </sentence><sentence id="1409">I was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1410">They treated me quite good. </sentence><sentence id="1411">They thought that I am Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And I developed here . </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was abscessed with puss. </sentence><sentence id="1414">So the Germans said it's not proper. </sentence><sentence id="1415">We'll bring you to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1416">I am a Jew, no papers. </sentence><sentence id="1417">How could they enter a <span

</sentence><sentence id="1419">He arranged. </sentence><sentence id="1420">They accepted me. </sentence><sentence id="1421">How little I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Before the operation, a priest comes for confession. </sentence><sentence id="1423">I didn't know how and what. </sentence><sentence id="1424">So he started talking. </sentence><sentence id="1425">So he said I see you're from the same <span class="populated place">town</span> that I am. </sentence><sentence id="1426">You're from <span class="populated place">Landberg</span> (ph) and I am special accent in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So he said how about...and now he wanted I should confess. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I said, Father, how about if you'll sing for me a song, a very famous song just from <span class="populated place">Landberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1429">This changed the mood, and he did. </sentence><sentence id="1430">But I was afraid after I will wake up or during when they give me anesthesia, I may spill who I am because usually what you do. </sentence><sentence id="1431">I spotted a nurse who looked to me Jewish and I said look, please, watch over me. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Protect me. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Why, she said. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Because I'm Jewish and you're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Not I'm not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I said I don't care. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Help me. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And I showed her my leg, which was already with gangrene and I developed lice last day in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I couldn't get rid of it. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I said help me. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And she did help. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So she wouldn't do it if she wouldn't be Jewish masquerading. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And also, imagine how you can control your mind. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Before even I woke up, they looked for my <span class="spatial object">nightgown</span> and I was able to point where it is hanging. </sentence><sentence id="1444">Meantime, Edmund came to visit me. </sentence><sentence id="1445">There, next <span class="spatial object">bed</span> to me was laying a Polish peasant girl by the . </sentence><sentence id="1446">She liked me. </sentence><sentence id="1447">She worked for a <span class="building">German casino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1448">Means they were employees, bookkeepers, everything for oil, from the <span

like a <span class="building">club</span> where they lived, dined and then they went to the <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1450">I said <span class="populated place">Kashimira</span>, can you get me a job there. </sentence><sentence id="1451">I thought if it's a German place, the <span class="building">Polish police</span> doesn't have any access. </sentence><sentence id="1452">Where  9 they used to comb the <span class="building">houses</span> in <span class="region">Polish sections</span> searching for Jews and I will have some security and a <span class="dlf">roof</span> over my head. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And one day a girl by the name Katia (ph)...1 forgot her last name...came to visit <span class="populated place">Kashia</span>, so this . </sentence><sentence id="1454">Kashia said, you know what. </sentence><sentence id="1455">You're like each other. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I notice you are educated. </sentence><sentence id="1457">She's educated. </sentence><sentence id="1458">You're alike. </sentence><sentence id="1459">She's Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Kashia started talking to me. </sentence><sentence id="1461">She recognized immediately that I am Jewish and I recognized that she's Jewish, so she started, tried to stay away. </sentence><sentence id="1462">So this chambermaid Kashia said to me, I thought you liked each other. </sentence><sentence id="1463">How come you dislike each other? </sentence><sentence id="1464">I couldn't tell her. </sentence><sentence id="1465">We came to the <span class="building">casino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1466">She obtained for me the job and I started as a chambermaid. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I had to clean eight <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, to kindle their fire and for this I have...she took me into their <span class="interior space">room</span> and this, how I could stay and was safer. </sentence><sentence id="1468">One day this Katia Ukrainian comes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, which was wonderful because she got food. </sentence><sentence id="1469">She...and because of it she got a <span class="interior space">room</span> for herself. </sentence><sentence id="1470">She said come to me. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I want to discuss with you something. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I said OK Katia, what is it. </sentence><sentence id="1473">I came to her. </sentence><sentence id="1474">She said look, you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1475">I am Jewish, and there is another Jewish girl, Soshia (ph) who doesn't sleep in the <span class="building">casino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1476">She sleeps outside but its very dangerous for us. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Because you are the last one, you are the one who has to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And she told me she was a medical student in <span class="populated place">Lamburg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1479">She comes from the and her husband's friends who who was a communist and was presently in <span class="country">Russia</span>, gave her the paper as Ukrainian, a Ukrainian, and this is how she's surviving. </sentence><sentence id="1480">So I said Katia, you're right. </sentence><sentence id="1481">By right I should leave, but I don't have a scrape of paper. </sentence><sentence id="1482">Let me get some documents and I promise you that I will leave, but again when you have to do with nice people, when Soshia who was the daughter of a lawyer from <span class="populated place">Lamburg</span>, a little bit older than I...she said I'm staying anyhow outside the theat...uh <span class="building">casino</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1483">I will go first. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And then my boss came to me and he says, he said you know, how comes you don't have an ID.How come Anna cannot feed you because not having an ID you don't have any ration cards? </sentence><sentence id="1485">So I had to apply. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I wrote a letter to <span class="populated place">Mundig</span> and I said I need baptismal papers because this is how you applied for ID. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Dear Mundig, bless his sole...he went to a Ukrainian priest, Catholic priest. </sentence><sentence id="1488">So I got my baptismal paper. </sentence><sentence id="1489">I'm Roman Catholic, but the baptismal paper, the stamp was for <span class="building">Ukrainian church</span>, <span class="building">Orthodox church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1490">When I gave the application to the police, they came looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Who am I? </sentence><sentence id="1492">What a contradiction. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And they call it in the German and they summoned me to the <span class="building">police</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Now I was thinking what can I do. </sentence><sentence id="1495">Not to report to <span class="building">police</span> means I have to run. </sentence><sentence id="1496">Where do I run again without papers. </sentence><sentence id="1497">To report, they will catch me and I'm gone. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So then he said...I looked very young, younger for my age than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1499">I was always very petite. </sentence><sentence id="1500">I had two braids and I prayed to God, the woman who'll investigate me should me an old maid or old man. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Somehow they had some compassion for children, for young people. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And I came there and she saw me...she said you know what, your priest got drunk. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Look what the nonsense he wrote. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Write for another baptismal paper. </sentence><sentence id="1505">But not I'm at fault, only this. </sentence><sentence id="1506">I have done it, so Mundig sent me another with the stamp Roman Catholic and this I got legitimate ID from the police which meant a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1507">No money could buy it, because this, you know, the first thing when they caught a Jew, they checked with the police, then they check with the <span class="populated place">parish</span>, so I was...because of it I was able to get a labor card and I was able to rep...get a card, you know, from uh , you know, to get health, health care. </sentence><sentence id="1508">And I worked there. </sentence><sentence id="1509">While I worked there, meantime came the Jewess from <span

</sentence><sentence id="2647">I should give it out. </sentence><sentence id="2648">Then there were many orphans that Jews started collecting them, you know, who survived, looked, some knew where they have hidden their children, and one Jewess, although she converted, , She took care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="2649">But she didn't have food to feed them, not to dress them. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And it came to my husband's attention and he was able to supply them. </sentence><sentence id="2651">What we didn't know...at that time my husband was a high official in

my family. </sentence><sentence id="2659">Even my husband with high position, I felt I'm a queen for one night. </sentence><sentence id="2660">This is not for me. </sentence><sentence id="2661">So I told my husband I don't want to stay. </sentence><sentence id="2662">We survived. </sentence><sentence id="2663">We have to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, and my husband wanted to
