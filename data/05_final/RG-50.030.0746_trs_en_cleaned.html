<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Well, I was born in <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>, which is very much in the center of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">My father worked for the <span class="building">Henschel Company</span>, so that's pretty much the most important <span class="building">factory</span> in <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">The <span class="building">Henschel</span> were famous for making <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span>, and later on, they made the famous <span class="spatial object">Henschel airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">That's where I was, and my mother disliked <span class="populated place">Kassel</span> very much. </sentence><sentence id="7">That's where the Lindenhessen (ph) lived there, very, very unpleasant people, mostly Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was the only Catholic, so they called me the <span class="building">Katholische Rattenschwanz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: <span class="spatial object">Catholic rattail</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Catholic rattail, and so then my father eventually secured a job as director of <span class="building">Feindliche Industrial Refrigeration Company</span> in <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, and so we moved there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: When I was 11, maybe 12, and of course there was a change then, a different <span class="building">school</span>, different environment. </sentence><sentence id="22">I joined the <span class="building">swimming club</span> and became part of the <span class="populated place">Jungvolk</span>, which is the early stage of the Hitler Youth, divided in <span class="populated place">Jungvolk</span>, Hitler Youth and then of course the armed forces, and at 14, I joined -- or better said, I had to join the Hitler Youth, which was an organization from 14 to 18 and it was very much a premilitary preparation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Did you like the <span class="building">Hitler Youth</span>, I mean what kind of activities did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: So does that mean you dropped out of the <span class="building">Hitler Youth</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: Dropped out? </sentence><sentence id="804">That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join. </sentence><sentence id="805">You had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that you couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for five generations, then you had to join. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: Ha. </sentence><sentence id="814">Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we were just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather underground. </sentence><sentence id="815">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="816">So it was so it was what in <span class="country">Germany</span> you call <span class="populated place">Schikane</span>, based upon our dislike for authority. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did and how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of the Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had these friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="867">They were nice kids and so on, and so we were very much interested in helping the underdog. </sentence><sentence id="868">So we considered the Jews underdogs. </sentence><sentence id="869">And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to places, well, we didn't want him to go. </sentence><sentence id="870">I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought one day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="871">And so he stayed with me for, oh, I don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. </sentence><sentence id="872">And it was not broadcast in my family that he's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="873">It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can he stay with us? </sentence><sentence id="874">Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, you see. </sentence><sentence id="875">And so in the <span class="building">apartment housing</span> which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. </sentence><sentence id="876">So they  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
