<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Well, I was born in <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>, which is very much in the center of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">My father worked for the <span class="building">Henschel Company</span>, so that's pretty much the most important <span class="building">factory</span> in <span class="populated place">Kassel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5">The <span class="building">Henschel</span> were famous for making <span class="spatial object">locomotives</span>, and later on, they made the famous <span class="spatial object">Henschel airplane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">That's where I was, and my mother disliked <span class="populated place">Kassel</span> very much. </sentence><sentence id="7">That's where the Lindenhessen (ph) lived there, very, very unpleasant people, mostly Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was the only Catholic, so they called me the <span class="building">Katholische Rattenschwanz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: <span class="spatial object">Catholic rattail</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Catholic rattail, and so then my father eventually secured a job as director of <span class="building">Feindliche Industrial Refrigeration Company</span> in <span class="populated place">Dusseldorf</span>, and so we moved there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: How old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: When I was 11, maybe 12, and of course there was a change then, a different <span class="building">school</span>, different environment. </sentence><sentence id="22">I joined the <span class="building">swimming club</span> and became part of the <span class="populated place">Jungvolk</span>, which is the early stage of the Hitler Youth, divided in <span class="populated place">Jungvolk</span>, Hitler Youth and then of course the armed forces, and at 14, I joined -- or better said, I had to join the Hitler Youth, which was an organization from 14 to 18 and it was very much a premilitary preparation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: So does that mean you dropped out of the <span class="building">Hitler Youth</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: Dropped out? </sentence><sentence id="888">That would have been impossible because it was obligatory to join. </sentence><sentence id="889">You had to have a qualified reason, like maybe losing one leg or something like that, that you couldn't do it, but as long as you were healthy and you didn't have Jewish blood for five generations, then you had to join. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Ha. </sentence><sentence id="898">Well of course we tried to be as clandestine as possible, so on the surface, we were just very loyal members of the Hitler Youth and our movement was rather underground. </sentence><sentence id="899">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="900">So it was so it was what in <span class="country">Germany</span> you call <span class="populated place">Schikane</span>, based upon our dislike for authority. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: Maybe -- maybe -- I don't know, maybe I should think a little more about what I did and how I did it, but maybe one of the things was that we did not enjoy the procedure of the Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosecution of Jews, which they were, and I had these friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="957">They were nice kids and so on, and so we were very much interested in helping the underdog. </sentence><sentence id="958">So we considered the Jews underdogs. </sentence><sentence id="959">And so this one guy, when we knew they were being evacuated and sent to places, well, we didn't want him to go. </sentence><sentence id="960">I didn't know his parents, and so I just thought one day if you don't want to go, you can stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="961">And so he stayed with me for, oh, I don't know, I would say probably six months or eight months. </sentence><sentence id="962">And it was not broadcast in my family that he's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="963">It was just he's a young man who needs a little help and can he stay with us? </sentence><sentence id="964">Yeah, he can sleep in my brother's <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, you see. </sentence><sentence id="965">And so in the <span class="building">apartment housing</span> which we lived in, there were a total of six parties, +. </sentence><sentence id="966">So they didn't know that he was a Jewish boy. </sentence><sentence id="967">It was not broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="968">He was just a friend. </sentence><sentence id="969">And so when I was arrested, then -- I believe that when I had a visit with -- from my mother, the question came out of what are we going to do with Hans Dieter (ph)? </sentence><sentence id="970">I said call Eddie Violent he's going to take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="971">So he took over. </sentence><sentence id="972">That was just one <span class="dlf">block</span> from our <span class="building">house</span>, and his situation was a little nicer because he lived a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="973">The <span class="building">house</span> was his. </sentence><sentence id="974">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="975">So he had a little more freedom and who walked in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="977">And he stayed with him for the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="978">What happened with him afterwards, I do not know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know -- oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="979">He told me one day, he said guess what? </sentence><sentence id="980">You you remember Hans? </sentence><sentence id="981">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="982">He died. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1515">A: Well, first, 1 was impressed by -- sounds a little funny in <span class="building">prison</span> setting, sounded beautiful, but this was a beautiful setup because it was not a <span class="building">prison</span> per se, but it used to be a <span class="building">convent</span> or <span class="building">cloister</span> and the <span class="region">area</span> was rather, rather attractive, and well, like in every <span class="building">prison</span>, first you surrender the clothes you have, and they give you a <span class="building">prison</span> uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1516">They gave me a <span class="interior space">cell</span>, which would be my <span class="building">home</span> for awhile, and we had lessons there of geography and so on and so forth, I mean, not very considerable but maybe -- maybe This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1517">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1518"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection twice a week or maybe only once a week. </sentence><sentence id="1519">I don't remember too well. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And my neighbor - - my neighbor in the <span class="interior space">cell</span> there after, he was kind of a, like later in the concentration, in the capo, he was a privileged prisoners, his <span class="interior space">cell</span> door was always open. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He could walk in and out when he want to, and I found out that he had killed his father. </sentence><sentence id="1522">But see killing your father was not as bad as helping French prisoners of war, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Anyway in my <span class="interior space">cell</span>, and then a week, two weeks later, then they found out that I hid -- I had more education than the rest of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1524">They were more of the lower echelon of society, so it was an elderly police employee who was the buyer. </sentence><sentence id="1525">He would buy vegetables and things that the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> of the <span class="building">prison</span> need, and they needed an assistant and he picked me. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And as such of course I could have survived forever there and I would have gained quite a bit of weight because the food was at my disposal, and so I did that for awhile until I had the problem with my attempt to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1527">Do you want me to go into that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
