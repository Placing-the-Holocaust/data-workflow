<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="110">What was the language that you spoke at <span class="building">home</span> with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: Tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Because Yiddish -- people that spoke Yiddish, they couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="134">You don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="135">You see, peop -- nobody will tell you this -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: -- but I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="142">The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very heavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="143">And people that spoke Yiddish, they can't get rid of it. </sentence><sentence id="144">So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know, they -- 1-i-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they couldn't -- they couldn't save themselves pretending to be Poles. </sentence><sentence id="145">So many thousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="146">It's very unusual, but that's is true, I bi-- nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. </sentence><sentence id="147">It's not offensive, it's just actually, this is how it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Yeah, go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn't speak Polish, or they spoke it with an accent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="164">Some, maybe in the small sh -- s-s -- <span class="populated place">shtetls</span>, you -- like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, but  Interview with George Dynin " October 21, 2015 most people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="165">The ones that just spoke Yiddish, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, were your parents more assimilated, in -- in that they spoke Polish and Russian, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Absolutely not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: They been -- we [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="179">It's better -- my father, he preferred to have a kosher food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: But you know, from this you cannot -- you change the type of food, and nobody knows who you are, you know. </sentence><sentence id="185">But the language you cou -- you couldn't get rid of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: It's just -- it's -- yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: It's an accent, or it's a-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: It's accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. </sentence><sentence id="195">So that's -- many people died because of this, but see, I am the first one that's not afraid to tell about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
