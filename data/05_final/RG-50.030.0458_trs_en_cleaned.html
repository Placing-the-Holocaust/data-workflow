<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="18">Yo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life. </sentence><sentence id="20">And one of our circle of frien -- the circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist, and all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party. </sentence><sentence id="21">Yes, Jewish, but the Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist. </sentence><sentence id="22">It just happened that many of the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical. </sentence><sentence id="23">Until 1938, it wasn't too difficult. </sentence><sentence id="24">Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in <span class="country">Italy</span>, there was a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that. </sentence><sentence id="25">And yet, the discussion I vaguely This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="26">It is not the primary source, and it has

of friends, particularly when we went to the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, climbed everythi -- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political issues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution. </sentence><sentence id="28">The general atmosphere was that even some intellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that was 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were -- yes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a good time. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was touched by it. </sentence><sentence id="30">At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to look for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the <span class="building">refuge</span>, and -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by educated people, but there were also a farmer who taught i-il pladoni, Mussolini didn't have much hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy. </sentence><sentence id="31">He is doing -- you know, why is he doing this, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that? </sentence><sentence id="32">And then, in the discussions, and as I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were personal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to <span class="building">refugi</span> for hikes. </sentence><sentence id="33">Near the <span class="env feature">lake</span> of <span class="populated place">Como</span>, there were <span class="env feature">mountains</span> called <span class="env feature">Laigreenai</span>, and there were refuges where we went, and we had to carry our food in the <span class="interior space">back</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Ex -- there were some supplies left there, brought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="35">But -- and the farmer would have milk, a -- etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="36">And then we would hike, and then the discussions. </sentence><sentence id="37">Yes, there was discussion of movies, there was discussion of <span class="building">theater</span>, there was discussion of opera. </sentence><sentence id="38">There were discussion of work in the <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found -- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work. </sentence><sentence id="40">Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions. </sentence><sentence id="41">"Hey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don't like the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

id="45">I made -- and my parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the pro-Nazi and the German. </sentence><sentence id="46">And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some German people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the upper class. </sentence><sentence id="47">And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti- Fascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">And it just happened that many intellectual were also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="49">At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated discussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, to put those people in. </sentence><sentence id="50">It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="51">The -- some of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were aware of the Fascist party having a special <span class="building">tribunal</span>, i-i -- where the Fascist didn't have <span class="building">courts</span> of law for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in <span class="country">Italy</span>, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then, they were against both. </sentence><sentence id="52">And instead of a <span class="building">court of law</span>, with judges, which of course many of the f -- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the <span class="building">special tribunal</span> could condemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect, the special <span class="building">tribunal</span> had the special Italian Secret Police, called <span class="building">Ovra</span>, O-v-r-a, to investigate the suspect. </sentence><sentence id="53">And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn't go up climbing, we couldn't go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I mean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the <span class="building">Ovra</span> could pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work, whether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were talking about some people were killed, executed. </sentence><sentence id="54">Some people were sent to what was known -- oh, some people to <span class="building">San Vittory prison</span>, something, somebody sent to <span class="region">remote area</span> in <span class="country">Italy</span>, where This is a

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection these people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family, except maybe once a year, twice a year, I can't remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="57">But they were deprived of the mail, very rarely they could have the mail. </sentence><sentence id="58">They could only receive visits from the family very rarely. </sentence><sentence id="59">In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in <span class="populated place">San Vittory</span>, or sent to these remote <span class="region">area</span>, there was the attempt to isolate them from society, deprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends. </sentence><sentence id="60">And the <span class="building">special tribunal</span> had the power to do that, in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and again I didn't understand very clearly, except in <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> was a place, after 1933, where priest, Socialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about the <span class="building">judicial system</span> being damaged. </sentence><sentence id="62">The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function. </sentence><sentence id="63">That meant that it became very arbitrary, also. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I also remember that both in <span class="country">Italy</span>, and I mention, in <span class="country">Germany</span>, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you know, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow. </sentence><sentence id="65">Now, that picture of the special <span class="building">tribunal</span>, those memory of <span class="populated place">San Vittory</span>, the exiled, it remained with me forever, for as long as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="66">But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy. </sentence><sentence id="67">There was <span class="country">country</span>, the -- the hikes in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>, seldom we went to the <span class="env feature">sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">Occasionally we went to a place called <span class="populated place">Paylee</span>, and I learned how to watch the <span class="dlf">farm</span> -- the fisherman to bring in the fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and the parsley, and I wasn't cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French eating, but <span class="env feature">mountains</span> were the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="69">Short weekend was [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="70">And, in addition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then the cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty.

meant we went to the <span class="building">refuge</span>, and then we picked, very carefully, a bouquet of -- it's daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very perfume, not cheesy. </sentence><sentence id="209">And you are taught conservation from day one. </sentence><sentence id="210">And again, in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> you talk about planning.

and while we were talking about fun in <span class="env feature">mountain</span>, there was a great deal of politics all the time. </sentence><sentence id="215">Now, the best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist. </sentence><sentence id="216">Anti-Fascist, many of them. </sentence><sentence id="217">And being Communist, but after having been in the <span

movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother. </sentence><sentence id="219">And they were talking about the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the Stalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes, Socialism, yes, a just society, due process of law. </sentence><sentence id="220">That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi all the time, <span class="populated place">Contamessa</span> -- <span class="populated place">Rainso Contamessa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no military judges, like the <span class="building">special tribunal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="222">So there was this combination of hat -- la -- <span

</sentence><sentence id="2037">So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them, and he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like

</sentence><sentence id="2057">One of the first thing when the Committee of National Liberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the people working in the
