<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Well, there was not a big change. </sentence><sentence id="131">The only thing happening which was really, you you saw it at the same time, was the black-out. </sentence><sentence id="132">From one day to another, you had to black- out. </sentence><sentence id="133"><span class="country">Denmark</span> was totally blacked-out. </sentence><sentence id="134">And maybe you'll understand how it was later to stand in the blacked-out <span class="dlf">beach</span> in <span class="country">Denmark</span> and look three miles over the <span class="env feature">straits</span>, the <span class="env feature">water</span> demarking <span class="country">Denmark</span> from <span class="country">Sweden</span>, where the lights were just like pearls on a string. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was so fantastic uh but the first thing there was the black-out. </sentence><sentence id="136">And then of course there were lack of goods and uh there was no connection with <span class="country">England</span> anymore, and our biggest trade partner and uh - but in the beginning the Germans tried to act just like  human beings. </sentence><sentence id="137">There was what, we should be the <span class="spatial object">model</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">We were the vikings, and we should be - I don't know what he wanted us to be - but there was not, you was not disturbed much by the Germans in the day-to-day, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: When did that change for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Well, for me, you see we were shocked to lost our freedom and every resistance movement first part - I was only 15 when I started - it was to be a messenger boy. </sentence><sentence id="142">Deliver </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="145"> for papers. </sentence><sentence id="146">Illegal papers of course. </sentence><sentence id="147">Because the first thing you really noticed is that all the news are censored. </sentence><sentence id="148">You only hear what the Germans, the Germans wanted you to hear. </sentence><sentence id="149">And therefore it was important to keep the real messages, to give the real news and that was to be duplicated and brought out by boys like me and it is of elder people but that was the way we started and it was the beginning to the resistance movement in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, before the , before anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: How did you get recruited? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: What did bringing them to the <span class="env feature">shore</span> entail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Well, if you - it happened this way in <span class="populated place">Snegerstein</span> - that uh two or three or four lived in one <span class="building">house</span>, was hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="239">And then we tried to be quite sure there was no German police, no German soldiers, no Danish uh corroborators, and we brought them down to the <span class="dlf">shore</span> where the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was waiting. </sentence><sentence id="240">We knew exactly when the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> would be there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="241">We had some - the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was normally stationed in <span class="country">Sweden</span> and we had every day that point there and there at that time. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> would go in and and we could uh have our passengers aboard. </sentence><sentence id="243">But it was very safe because we did everything possible to secure the way from the <span class="building">houses</span> down to the <span class="env feature">beach</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What did secure mean? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: That they were not captured. </sentence><sentence id="246">That we were able to see there were no uh on the way. </sentence><sentence id="247">Also they had to react in a special way - very silent. </sentence><sentence id="248">Uh we had a problem with children sometimes but we have Doctor . </sentence><sentence id="249">He gave them injection, the children. </sentence><sentence id="250">But he was very afraid sometimes because he said I don't know this patient - how much can I do, but nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was, they came over all and we never lost a passenger. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: How did your captain find his way in without lights? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: Well, we have in <span class="country">Denmark</span> uh pilots of course, but then we had people which we called "men who knows" and that's people who know that exactly part of the the <span class="dlf">border</span>, of the of the <span class="dlf">shore</span> and uh it's so in <span class="country">Denmark</span> in the <span class="dlf">straits</span> that the <span class="env feature">sand reefs</span>, there are some <span class="env feature">sand reefs</span>, that they are shifting every year. </sentence><sentence id="909">But if you know them you can go from one <span class="env feature">reef</span> through a <span class="dlf">hole</span> into another and then you should be a man who knows the way to do it all as people they would drown. </sentence><sentence id="910">And uh the captain knew the thing. </sentence><sentence id="911">He knew every inch of the uh <span class="env feature">beach</span> and the <span class="env feature">shore</span> outside. </sentence><sentence id="912">It's interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: You mentioned earlier too that being without guns, that would get you a different sentence than if you had guns if you were caught? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: Yes, in that time there would be, if you were caught with a gun, you had the risk to have the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="945">Otherwise you will shot, maybe shot at sight, but uh if you were caught without guns and then you'll get a long term death penalty, be sent to <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> but OK, there was a very much better chance, and at that time uh we, the most of the Danish uh resistance movement caught would be sent uh to a <span class="populated place">camp</span> just north of the <span class="dlf">German-Danish border</span> where the conditions were some better, oh no, much  5 better than in a, the <span class="populated place">German concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="946">So there was really difference if you were taken with guns, explosives - then that would be a death penalty, but we had no use of them. </sentence><sentence id="947">We shouldn't catch fish with the guns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
