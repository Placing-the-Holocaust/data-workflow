<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the teacher, and after deg33, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor every afternoon -- one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the grades did improve. </sentence><sentence id="128">What my parents did not consider was that the <span class="region">outside world</span> had an influence on children. </sentence><sentence id="129">They told us that things would change. </sentence><sentence id="130">It would not remain this way. </sentence><sentence id="131">The neighbor's children would begin to play with us again. </sentence><sentence id="132">The boys would no longer beat us up on the way to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">It would -- life would normalize. </sentence><sentence id="134">They didn't say exactly when, but they were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. </sentence><sentence id="135">And my parents, of course, could not vote in German elections. </sentence><sentence id="136">They never became naturalized German citizens. </sentence><sentence id="137">They didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="138">We went to <span class="country">Poland</span> quite frequently to see the family, to see Grandmother, and what I heard in <span class="country">Poland</span> as a very young child was that you, in <span class="country">Germany</span>, are complaining about anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="139">You don't know what it's like in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">Your economic conditions do not compare to ours. </sentence><sentence id="141">To me, it did not make sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Were you supposed to sit there very quietly and they would carry on the conversation, or would people ask you questions about what had happened at <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: There were very few questions at the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">The maid would sometimes bring in a dish or plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish. </sentence><sentence id="328">We were asked questions about <span class="building">school</span>, but not necessarily at the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">It was when it came time to do homework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, "No, homework first." </sentence><sentence id="330">It was a typical education of the "30s when you had to be within the role of a child, not have the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories. </sentence><sentence id="331">It wasn't done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: But you seem to remember it very fondly. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How so? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher. </sentence><sentence id="393">I could think of putting thumb tacks some place, or put some glue on the <span class="spatial object">chair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">Or, when it's later on, when the physics professor said, "Turn the <span class="spatial object">Bunsen burner</span> on low," I turned it on high, and all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> blew out, and my dad had to pay for new <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="395">So, I had my share of troubles. </sentence><sentence id="396">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="397">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="398"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4662">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4663">Singer spent his day mainly on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, or away from the <span class="building">office</span> seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. </sentence><sentence id="4664">I would pick up at the bottom of the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> in the <span class="building">police station</span> from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics -- so many people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported. </sentence><sentence id="4665">When Singer came back into the <span class="building">office</span>, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is not all Singer's. </sentence><sentence id="4666">I think several hundred pages at least, and that's a forthcoming book now. </sentence><sentence id="4667">He was a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="4668">He had worked as a journalist in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4669">He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page -- I couldn't even call it a report. </sentence><sentence id="4670">It was more like a love letter to Rumkowski. </sentence><sentence id="4671">If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you. </sentence><sentence id="4672">It's available in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and at the <span class="building">University</span> in <span class="populated place">Giessen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4673">It does not fit his personality. </sentence><sentence id="4674">It does not fit his other reports. </sentence><sentence id="4675">It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. </sentence><sentence id="4676">He followed orders. </sentence><sentence id="4677">Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn't have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. </sentence><sentence id="4678">So, this last entry to <span class="populated place">Rumkowski</span> could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread,

I'd give it to my friend, and she would bring me a portion to work everyday. </sentence><sentence id="4693">So, I trusted her with my bread. </sentence><sentence id="4694">What else can I say of the <span class="building">Singer</span>? </sentence><sentence id="4695">The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near <span class="populated place">Prague</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4696">No children, very wealthy. </sentence><sentence id="4697">I think the husband died or was killed -- or he died in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4698">In the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr.Singer. </sentence><sentence id="4699">I was, about six years ago, at <span class="building">Sonoma State University</span>, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner. </sentence><sentence id="4700">John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4701">It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt. </sentence><sentence id="4702">He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="4703">So, I told him the story about the will, and he's now -- I mean, the will was lost in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> -- he's trying to regain the <span class="building">house</span> near <span class="dlf">park</span>, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, but the name and the numbers have never appeared. </sentence><sentence id="4704">So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady again is very strange. </sentence><sentence id="4705">I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. </sentence><sentence id="4706">On some level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it? </sentence><sentence id="4707">His son had, at times, a
