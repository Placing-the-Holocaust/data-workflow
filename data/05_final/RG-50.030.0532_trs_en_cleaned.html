very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn't be good for the Jewish people to stay in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> because the war was broke -- breaking out. </sentence><sentence id="8">So my parents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>, and we packed whatever we could in a -- in a rush to leave, and -- for <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was a little girl, I really didn't understand too much. </sentence><sentence id="10">I saw people taping the <span

</sentence><sentence id="11">And we took a <span class="spatial object">duffle bag</span>, whatever we could, and we left by <span class="spatial object">train</span> to go to <span

that they packed was sticking up, and I sat on that <span class="spatial object">bag</span>, and I had to be treated by the <span class="building">Red Cross</span>, and that's why I remember that incident. </sentence><sentence id="14">And the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went on, and we really didn't know where we were going in <span class="country">France</span>, and we went towards this -- I guess on the -- the <span class="region">southern part</span> of <span class="country">France</span>, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all i-in a place called Brens(ph),

they wanted to give things for their children, and I would -- I know I wasn't allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="38">And then they took me away from by the <span class="dlf">window</span> so I couldn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="39">And we were there, and also I was in a little <span class="interior space">nursery</span> where I cried all the time because I wanted to be with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="40">And one day I escaped when the milkman came, and I ho --I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my name, and -- and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the <span class="building">barracks</span> looked alike, and I couldn't find her. </sentence><sentence id="41">So somebody

hungry, and there was a lot of suffering all around me. </sentence><sentence id="43">My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see her once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age. </sentence><sentence id="44">The rabbi in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> heard that they were going to send everybody to <span class="populated

place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong, that she could survive all of this. </sentence><sentence id="57">And with a few francs we went -- we didn't go to see my sister, my mother took me to the <span class="building">La Gare</span>, which is the <span class="building">railroad station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">And she tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">And in <span class="populated

there would know where my father was. </sentence><sentence id="61">So -- but at the <span class="building">station</span>, I started to cry and she was afraid that the Germans would -- because you had to show a pass wherever you went, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me soda. </sentence><sentence id="62">I wanted soda to keep me quiet. </sentence><sentence id="63">So when she went to buy the ticket, the money that she used for the soda, she didn't have enough for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="64">So she met a woman there that she's a French lady, and she sold her -- she had a piece of soap, and she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets and she took us on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke Yiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> to ask for identity. </sentence><sentence

place">Marseilles</span>, she -- she told my mother, I can no longer stay with -- with you, because -- she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there. </sentence><sentence id="69">So we didn't know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span> called Hotel Avant(ph). </sentence><sentence id="70">I don't know exactly how she found that out, but we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my mother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him. </sentence><sentence id="71">And I carried on so that she couldn't even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a place, Hotel Avant(ph) in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span>, where all the Jewish people were assembled. </sentence><sentence id="72">But it wasn't a very good place to stay, because the Germans would come with big <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they would raffle -- they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">So we were in that <span class="building">hotel</span>, it's like a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="74">My father's friend was there, and he said he hasn't seen my father for a while. </sentence><sentence id="75">Sometimes he comes in there, but he hasn't seen him for a while. </sentence><sentence id="76">But that night we went to sleep and my father cut his finger while he was -- he was a lumberjack during the war, in th -- in the <span class="env

always remember, because he had a big scar. </sentence><sentence id="79">And he had to see a doctor because the bleeding wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="80">So he -- he came in to see the

</sentence><sentence id="85">So in the morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time. </sentence><sentence id="86">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my father went to suture -- oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my mother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn't with him. </sentence><sentence id="88">My brother and father, in the beginning they were like homeless people. </sentence><sentence id="89">But then my father saw that he couldn't take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family. </sentence><sentence id="90">And they took very good care of him. </sentence><sentence id="91">So my mother said she's not leaving unless he gets my brother, so it took a -- well, we went to this vil -- little <span class="populated place">village</span> which is called <span class="populated place">Aix-en-Provence</span> and from there we went with my father to <span class="populated place">Tres</span>, which was in the <span

lived, and she gave us a bigger <span class="interior space">room</span>, and my broth -- my father got my brother back from the French people, and we all lived in that <span class="interior space">room</span>: my mother, my father, my brother and me. </sentence><sentence id="93">And my sister was still at Erna(ph). </sentence><sentence id="94">So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she didn't like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="95">And she would take me with her all over. </sentence><sentence id="96">She would take me to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, she would take me to <span class="building">church</span>. </sentence><sentence id="97">So she wanted to really baptize me. </sentence><sentence id="98">And she gave us like food, and she gave us -- and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent. </sentence><sentence id="99">We all lived in a big <span

her to us, to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="106">And my mother had to go to meet her in <span class="populated place">Marseilles</span>, and on the way back they didn't like her pass -- you know, they came to see, this one, to see if everything was all right, and they -- they almost didn't let her get off the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, because they didn't like the papers. </sentence><sentence id="107">It didn't have some kind of signature, and the bus driver said, come on, let's -- let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she came to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and
