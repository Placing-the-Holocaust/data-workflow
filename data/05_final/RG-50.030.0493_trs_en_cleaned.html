<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: Now, when you say that you were -- and I'm assuming you mean the family -- was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you? </sentence><sentence id="953">Or, was it both? </sentence></p></dialogue>
