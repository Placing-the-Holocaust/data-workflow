<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And, was he an easy going...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: He was easy going, yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">He loved to read. </sentence><sentence id="247">He devoured reading, and it's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="248">The last two years of the <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, he remained sitting. </sentence><sentence id="249">He failed because he was interested in his own agenda just to read. </sentence><sentence id="250">He was interested, and he just kept on reading and didn't care about <span class="building">school</span>, but this happened with me too when I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">One day, I remember coming <span class="building">home</span> and declaring, "I know everything there is to know. </sentence><sentence id="252">I know how to count to a hundred." </sentence><sentence id="253">I knew the alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="254">"And, I'm not going to <span class="building">school</span> anymore or if I have to go to <span class="building">school</span>, I will simply not pay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera." </sentence><sentence id="255">And, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something - you were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my parents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English. </sentence><sentence id="256">I had British tutors and so did my older brother. </sentence><sentence id="257">So, I passed only one subject. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: English. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: English, and that was English. </sentence><sentence id="274">I remained sitting, and what was -- what happened was war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, "My god, war broke out now. </sentence><sentence id="275">I will not have to go back to <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: No, no, actually, I've been thinking about it, and I don't remember having discussed this with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: And, no one said to you, "You don't know everything, George, if you just can count to a hundred." </sentence><sentence id="291">I mean nobody -- they just accepted what you said. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot. </sentence><sentence id="295">I was fortunate to have a lot of toys, and I just -- <span class="spatial object">trains</span> and <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, toys, all sorts of toys. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was imaging that I was a general -- that was already in 1939, 1940 -- on the <span class="dlf">Line</span> and a cousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was <span class="dlf">Siegfried Lineland</span>, and I was . </sentence><sentence id="297">We played war, and we had <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and we had <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span>, and we had all sorts of toys. </sentence><sentence id="298">The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="299">He's older than I am. </sentence><sentence id="300">He lives in <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span> now. </sentence><sentence id="301">So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when we used to play war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Now, you were probably brought up in a fairly wealthy situation. </sentence><sentence id="311">Am I correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about -- thinking about it in anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian Jews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember -- there were no, I said, "Categorically, there were no poor people in <span class="populated place">Libau</span> who were Jews in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>." </sentence><sentence id="315">So, they snickered at me saying, "You don't know this. </sentence><sentence id="316">You and your family probably didn't know that there were poor Jews in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>, but there were plenty of poor Jews in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>." </sentence><sentence id="317">This came to me as a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="318">I should" ve thought it through, obviously, but I had never met -- let's put it this way -- one who was not, well, well endowed from this perspective. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: And, did you live in a big <span class="building">house</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Well, yes he would -- what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was supper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between ten and twelve he saw patients in the <span class="building">office</span>, or was it nine-thirty. </sentence><sentence id="337">Then, he also made <span class="building">house</span> calls. </sentence><sentence id="338">Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on <span class="building">house</span> calls, and then he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="339">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="340"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection had office hours, if memory -- memory serves me right, from four to six. </sentence><sentence id="341">But, he had so many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight- thirty when I did not see him because I was already in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the day, were there a lot of conversation? </sentence><sentence id="351">Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="355">But, then, when I did sort of things that were unacceptable at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, I was sent back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: And, where would be "back" to-? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2176">A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> with furs. </sentence><sentence id="2177">Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family. </sentence><sentence id="2178">So, he always looked at the <span class="dlf">glass</span> half full rather than half empty. </sentence><sentence id="2179">That's my interpretation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2204">A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by Latvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of the German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2205">So, apparently, some people were shot even before, just before the German occupation took place in <span class="populated place">Libau</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2371">A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn't -- I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2372">I didn't understand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2373">I hardly knew what it meant before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2374">As I said, I knew I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2375">I knew about Matza, Passover, about certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on candles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much about the significance. </sentence></p></dialogue>

already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="2555">So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the <span class="building">villa</span> was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. </sentence><sentence id="2556">Her husband was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2557">So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel's -- the

</sentence><sentence id="2577">You could buy everything and anything for very little money. </sentence><sentence id="2578">And, we had antique -- an antique for example <span class="interior

</sentence><sentence id="2581">I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2582">And, not only the German , but also the <span class="building">German Navy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2583">There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy.

of Cukurs. </sentence><sentence id="2590">He had several fingers missing. </sentence><sentence id="2591">I don't know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance. </sentence><sentence id="2592">And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the <span class="spatial object">Leicas</span> because we had two still hidden in the <span class="interior

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2906">Q: Clearly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2908">A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2909">It's an interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="2910">Maybe this was one reason why I was "invited" to become his runner. </sentence><sentence id="2911">A second reason perhaps, it's my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background. </sentence><sentence id="2912">I don't know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to, let's say to or to SS who was the head of the <span class="building">SS</span> in <span class="populated place">Libau</span> or to Inspector of the . </sentence><sentence id="2913">So, and I could communicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German. </sentence><sentence id="2914">Perhaps this is a reason, but again, as | said before, it's pure speculation and I do not know the facts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2922">Q: So, the job that you had to be a runner was primarily going from inside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> outside delivering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2924">A: And, also keeping count of the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="2925">When we moved into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we had something like 823 people survived out of <span class="populated place">community</span> of close to 8,000. </sentence><sentence id="2926">And, when -- in the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them the metal tags as they went out to work in <span class="spatial object">columns</span>, and in the late afternoon, I had to collect these tags and hang them up. </sentence><sentence id="2927">So, I remember the numbers, and you could see immediately if somebody escaped or what. </sentence><sentence id="2928">The number, you associated that with a name, and that is how you kept tabs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
