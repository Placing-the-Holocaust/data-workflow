and had all kinds of achievements, as he was dying said two things, "Don't you ever moun me because look at where I started from and look at how my life was," and he said, "but in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> they're saying that our sister is alive. </sentence><sentence id="43">They even say she has a child." </sentence><sentence id="44">And he says, "Maybe you want to go back and just give a quick check." </sentence><sentence id="45">So I did go back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: And I put her picture in the paper and I met with 20 of her classmates and they all said what -- how many --she was the most popular girl around and -- but the truth was that they had all tumed against her. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I spent six days interviewing people and checking and there was -- it was all nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I fast forward 20 years and I told the story to my friend Fred Spiegel, who is a survivor who lived in a <span class="populated place">town</span> very close -- very close to me, and he got angry and he went to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and he had them investigate, and the reason was because they had a memorial like the <span class="spatial object">dankstein</span> (ph) and my grandfather's name was not on it or my sister's name was not on it and I -- I felt upset about it but I felt upset about it enough that I never wanted to go back to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and not to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="86">He did go back to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span> and he made them investigate and they found out that she had died with my parents in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="87">She had died; she was murdered there, and they put hername on. </sentence><sentence id="88">And about a year ago with my eight grandchildren and my -- my children and their spouses, we went back there. </sentence><sentence id="89">It was very heartwarming. </sentence><sentence id="90">It was -- it kind of put -- helped put things to rest in my mind because Ruth is always with me, she always will be, especially if] do anything good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="92">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="93"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Ofcourse. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: She's there-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Ofcourse. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: -- encouraging me. </sentence><sentence id="98">But to me what was really rewarding was to see the pain that the people in <span class="populated place">Unna</span> that I met, the minister from the <span class="building">church</span> there which has 2,000 members was in tears and I told him, "You were notalive. </sentence><sentence id="99">How -- why are you -- why are you feeling the pain?" </sentence><sentence id="100">He said, "I wasn't alive, my <span class="building">church</span> was, and my <span class="building">church</span> did nothing." </sentence><sentence id="101">And I got that kind ofa feeling and I think that we need -- we need to leam this lesson that while we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers, we are responsible for making the world - - by accepting what they did, that it doesn't happen, as atrocities around the world can continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
