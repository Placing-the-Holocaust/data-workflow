<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: In <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, right in the middle of <span class="populated place">town</span> we lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: So what was your childhood like? </sentence><sentence id="45">Tell me your earliest memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brother who was five years older. </sentence><sentence id="49">And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family. </sentence><sentence id="50">And my father was much older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="51">My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me. </sentence><sentence id="52">And my mother was 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much older, too. </sentence><sentence id="53">And we lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> right in the middle of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">And so my father was a lawyer, an This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="55">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="56"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection attorney, and he had his office -- I think we were on the <span class="interior space">fourth floor</span> or <span class="interior space">sixth floor</span> -- I'm not sure -- of this <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">And he had an <span class="building">office</span> on the <span class="interior space">mezzanine</span> of that same <span class="interior space">floor</span>, so he would always come <span class="building">home</span> for lunch at 1:00 o'clock, around the time that I came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="58">And that was our main meal at that time. </sentence><sentence id="59">And in those days, children did not go out of the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="60">There was always somebody with me, a Fraulein type. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I was taken everywhere, to the <span class="dlf">park</span> and ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="62">My father took me ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="63">And there was no such thing as really playing in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">But we did take summer vacations, lengthy summer vacations to either a different part of <span class="country">Austria</span> or to the <span class="env feature">beach</span> in <span class="region">northern Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">And so then I think we were able to play freely. </sentence><sentence id="66">But during the year, we were pretty constricted. </sentence><sentence id="67">My brother and I were not too close. </sentence><sentence id="68">The ideas in those days made a lot of difference. </sentence><sentence id="69">And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial. </sentence><sentence id="70">But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth - - he would play games and especially chess with me. </sentence><sentence id="71">And I just recently picked it up again. </sentence><sentence id="72">So that's been fun. </sentence><sentence id="73">And so I went to <span class="building">elementary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman. </sentence><sentence id="75">She was built that way. </sentence><sentence id="76">And I never liked <span class="building">gym</span>. </sentence><sentence id="77">So I think that was four grades or five grades. </sentence><sentence id="78">And then I went to another <span class="building">school</span>, a <span class="building">private school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="79">I believe it was a <span class="building">private school</span> called <span class="building">Luithlen</span>, L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N. And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="building">school</span> after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in <span class="building">school</span> there somehow until I could leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: So the <span class="building">schools</span> that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="117">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="118">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="119">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="120">And then in this <span class="building">middle school</span> we had religion classes, and they were done with release time. </sentence><sentence id="121">In other words, the Protestant children would go one place for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another. </sentence><sentence id="122">And that's when I began to go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="123">My parents really didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="124">They would go to their parents or my father's parents in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="125">But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays. </sentence><sentence id="126">And in fact, we had a <span class="spatial object">Christmas tree</span> for many years until I made my mother buy a <span class="spatial object">menorah</span> when I was old enough to go to <span class="building">synagogue</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="127">And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to children's services, the young people's services at the main <span class="building">synagogue</span> in <span class="populated place">Vienn</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="129">So I didn't take all that very seriously at that time. </sentence><sentence id="130">My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by <span class="spatial object">car</span> with my parents to a place called <span class="populated place">Bad Gastein</span>, a resort-type thing. </sentence><sentence id="131">And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="132">And the <span class="populated place">village</span> was in the <span class="env feature">valley</span>, and we came down from the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="133">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="134"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="env feature">mountain</span> or <span class="env feature">hill</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="135">And all the <span class="dlf">windows</span> in the <span class="populated place">town</span>, in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, were lit up and there were candles in the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="136">And apparently a chancellor from <span class="country">Austria</span>, and his name was Dollfuss, had died. </sentence><sentence id="137">I don't know whether he died or was killed. </sentence><sentence id="138">But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="139">And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="141">And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="142">And he worried a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="143">My mother was a worrywart, too. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I've become a worrywart as well. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I married one. </sentence><sentence id="146">I married one, too. </sentence><sentence id="147">But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="148">And he was very serious. </sentence><sentence id="149">He was quite an intellectual person. </sentence><sentence id="150">He was always reading. </sentence><sentence id="151">So there was really very little game playing in our <span class="building">house</span> except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="152">And then I went to <span class="building">gymnastic classes</span> as a little girl next <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And swimming, I think. </sentence><sentence id="154">So somehow when Hitler came to <span class="country">Austria</span> and was practically invited into <span class="country">Austria</span>, somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear. </sentence><sentence id="155">So I don't know what else I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="156">I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same <span class="building">school</span>, but they lived other places. </sentence><sentence id="157">So it wasn't like you could get together after <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">You had to make a play date or something. </sentence><sentence id="159">A little older than a play date. </sentence><sentence id="160">And one friend, Francie, did come to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and I did see her once or twice in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">Oh, and another friend, Eva Schiffer. </sentence><sentence id="162">She was a real intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="163">My father adored her. </sentence><sentence id="164">And she lived around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="165">And my grades were always compared to hers. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I think she's a retired professor at <span class="populated place">Amherst</span> or <span class="populated place">Andover</span> now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167">And then one friend went to <span class="region">South America</span>, to <span class="country">Argentina</span>, and we completely lost touch. </sentence><sentence id="168">And a boy I liked whet to <span class="country">Uruguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">So everybody was spread out. </sentence><sentence id="170">There was no cohesiveness. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one <span class="populated place">town</span> and had their <span class="building">high school</span> crowd and go to reunions and all these memories. </sentence><sentence id="172">So I don't have that. </sentence><sentence id="173">So I don't know what else should I tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: So do you remember feeling -- you didn't -- did you recognize or celebrate any Jewish holidays in your <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Well, we then eventually bought a <span class="spatial object">menorah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">I don't remember celebrating Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="226">No, really, I don't think we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Were a lot of your friends Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Yeah, they were all Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: So growing up did you experience any anti-Semitism in your -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Not immediately. </sentence><sentence id="236">Not among my friends, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- wasn't open to that because there was nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="237">And we had non-Jewish help, Frauleins and so forth, a housekeeper. </sentence><sentence id="238">But I didn't experience anything from them. </sentence><sentence id="239">And </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="245"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="246">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="247"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection of course, they had to leave as soon as Hitler came. </sentence><sentence id="248">Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher. </sentence><sentence id="249">And they were all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="250">But we talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="251">And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did. </sentence><sentence id="252">And we would -- this is before <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but we were aware of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help. </sentence><sentence id="253">My father had to get rid of his secretary. </sentence><sentence id="254">He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something. </sentence><sentence id="255">But personally, I can't say I experienced it. </sentence><sentence id="256">My main experience was years later when I visited <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> the first time, I think, in "69. </sentence><sentence id="257">Do you want to hear that story? </sentence><sentence id="258">Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Uh-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: With my husband. </sentence><sentence id="277">And since he didn't speak German, we couldn't go to the <span class="building">theater</span>, but we went to a lot of <span class="building">operas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And so one night we went to the <span class="building">oper</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: And we also stayed at a <span class="building">hotel</span> right across from the <span class="dlf">oper</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: We didn't have time to eat beforehand, so we went to a <span class="building">restaurant</span> nearby there afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="281">And I think generally in there when a place is crowded, they don't have you necessarily wait. </sentence><sentence id="282">They seat you with somebody. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="283">And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time. </sentence><sentence id="284">Started talking somehow. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I spoke a little broken German. </sentence><sentence id="286">And he said, "Oh, how come your German is so good?" </sentence><sentence id="287">or something. </sentence><sentence id="288">And I said, "Well, I'm glad you think it's good." </sentence><sentence id="289">I said, "I used to live here." </sentence><sentence id="290">And he said, "Oh?" </sentence><sentence id="291">And I said, "Well, I left in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="292">I had to leave when Hitler came to <span class="populated place">Austri</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A:" And so he said, "Oh," and then he fell silent. </sentence><sentence id="294">Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something. </sentence><sentence id="295">Anyway, he became silent and five minutes later he got up. </sentence><sentence id="296">And it felt very chilly. </sentence><sentence id="297">The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think. </sentence><sentence id="298">So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="299">And just such a tiny little incident that I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="300">So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered. </sentence><sentence id="301">But I just did not happen to be with people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: How did the <span class="populated place">Nuremburg</span> laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you and your family at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Well, my father I think not being able to have anybody working for you who is even partially Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="314">So that was the big thing. </sentence><sentence id="315">And that meant that -- you know, we had household help, a maid. </sentence><sentence id="316">And everybody was very loyal and friendly and they suddenly had to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="317">For my father, no help in the <span class="building">office</span>, and the <span class="building">office</span> was shrinking. </sentence><sentence id="318">He was upset about that. </sentence><sentence id="319">And so there wasn't anybody in my family, whether -- we were just Jewish, so that wasn't in question, whether we had a grandfather or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="320">So I think that was the main thing. </sentence><sentence id="321">What else was in there? </sentence><sentence id="322">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="323">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="324">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="325"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: You said that your father talked about the things that Hitler was doing. </sentence><sentence id="340">Were you aware of the Naziism and what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Yeah, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="344">As I look back, we were very politically aware as children or teenagers. </sentence><sentence id="345">Much more so than I later found kids either in <span class="country">England</span> or <span class="country">America</span> being. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="346">Yeah, we were. </sentence><sentence id="347">And then, of course, when the annexation started. </sentence><sentence id="348">And my mother's half-sister lived, in <span class="populated place">Prague</span>, her husband, and he was -- I mean, they were very well- situated. </sentence><sentence id="349">He was the president of a <span class="building">bank</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">And they refused to leave. </sentence><sentence id="351">I mean, this whole business over what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="352">In fact, I had an uncle and an aunt in <span class="populated place">Vienn</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: And he was a government employee. </sentence><sentence id="354">And I guess he was half Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="355">He thought it would never happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="356">And they didn't leave, and they perished in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="357">My aunt and uncle in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> left in time. </sentence><sentence id="358">Their children made them leave just in time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Do you recall -- What are your memories of Hitler coming to power in <span class="country">Austria</span>? </sentence><sentence id="366">Do you recall when the change happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="370">I remember that something -- he immediately took over the <span class="building">radio station</span>, the one means of communication. </sentence><sentence id="371">And I remember -- of course there were a lot of Nazi soldiers around <span class="populated place">town</span>, and they were marching in the <span class="dlf">Ringstrasse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="373">And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="374">And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later. </sentence><sentence id="375">I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="376">But then we began to be really afraid. </sentence><sentence id="377">The person in power was the superintendent of the <span class="building">apartment building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe. </sentence><sentence id="379">And everything depended on him. </sentence><sentence id="380">And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them. </sentence><sentence id="381">But fortunately that never happened. </sentence><sentence id="382">My brother actually left the year before. </sentence><sentence id="383">He left soon after Hitler came to power, and he went tom <span class="country">Germany</span> and then to <span class="country">Denmark</span> and later on to <span class="region">South America</span>, to <span class="populated place">Bolivi</span> </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: So I was the only one left at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">And my stepbrother had married. </sentence><sentence id="386">And he was -- my father's first wife was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="387">So my stepbrother for certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn't grow up with anything else either, just nondenominational. </sentence><sentence id="388">And he married a Jewish woman, one whose sister and brother-in- law actually emigrated to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, to <span class="country">Israel</span> then. </sentence><sentence id="389">But they left. </sentence><sentence id="390">His biological mother was related to a very prominent <span class="building">Czech shoe manufacturer</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">And they were willing to help them get out, but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="392">But everybody had to survive in those days. </sentence><sentence id="393">That's what they had to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
