soft-hearted, and this is how this couple, Rochelle and her husband and the baby, came in hiding with us, because we wanted to help them but it would have been much smarter if we didn't, if...we should have been more selfish so you didn't have as large a cluster of people together, but my parents knew her when she was what, fifteen, sixteen, and he was from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="673">They knew him as a youngster, so they did for them and we went in together, but as a whole, Jews did not...I think my father ran into the man who had given out the list because you know you walked the <span class="dlf">street</span>, you went into the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and he knew the two girls were in a <span class="building">Catholic home</span> and he wouldn't tell my father where because he didn't want...you see, he was smart ina way. </sentence><sentence id="674">He didn't want other Jews to
