<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Start with your name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is Carl--C-A-R-L--H. Kniiemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N. Kniiemann. </sentence><sentence id="10">And I was born in <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">Actually, the Germans called it <span class="populated place">Bromberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12">A very difficult name to spell, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: In what year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Uh, 1922, 15th of November. </sentence><sentence id="20">And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932. </sentence><sentence id="21">And in November, we left <span class="country">Poland</span> because my father was German citizen and businessman. </sentence><sentence id="22">We had a small <span class="building">factory</span>--<span class="spatial object">bakery machinery</span> and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh, so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What was it like growing up? </sentence><sentence id="30">You can look at me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="34">In <span class="country">Poland</span>, actually, compared with <span class="country">Germany</span>, it was a free <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">I came to <span class="country">Germany</span> expecting a paradise. </sentence><sentence id="36">My parents had told me that it would be like this. </sentence><sentence id="37">But it turned out that life in <span class="country">Poland</span> was like living in a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="38">There was strike, there was economic hardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="39">Most of my friends were Polish boys from the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic minority and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="40">The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so, my friends came up to me and said, "Tomorrow!" </sentence><sentence id="41">It meant actually they were mad at me; but they never came with a knife and cut my throat. </sentence><sentence id="42">I didn't expect them to either, you know. </sentence><sentence id="43">They didn't expect to do that either. </sentence><sentence id="44">So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic problems. </sentence><sentence id="45">And you get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="46">And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not getting upset about it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="47">My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent, all three. </sentence><sentence id="48">The family came from <span class="country">Hungary</span> originally via <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="49">And Frederick the Great took these <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span> Germans into <span class="region">East Prussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="50">That's where my mother landed. </sentence><sentence id="51">And the family mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person. </sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is just...is not getting upset about anything. </sentence><sentence id="53">But already as a child I knew when a problem came up, she stepped right in and helped solving it. </sentence><sentence id="54">She never turned her back. </sentence><sentence id="55">My father same thing. </sentence><sentence id="56">I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="57">So it dropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal mistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem and make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it. </sentence><sentence id="58">So I was a happy child. </sentence><sentence id="59">My father was a hunter. </sentence><sentence id="60">He went fishing. </sentence><sentence id="61">He was socially quite active. </sentence><sentence id="62">We had parties our <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">Being a businessman in <span class="country">Poland</span> meant actually that you had your clients invite at least once or twice a year. </sentence><sentence id="64">Once at least for a big hunt. </sentence><sentence id="65">Uh, that's why my  father really kept the <span class="dlf">hunting ground</span> to have a party opportunity to reward his customers. </sentence><sentence id="66">My father also became honorary consul of the German <span class="country">Weimar Republic</span>, so as a businessman...And he served in this function, I think, until "29 or so. </sentence><sentence id="67">And, of course, he knew about the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="68">Because of the <span class="building">foreign office</span> in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already indicated that Hitler will take over very soon. </sentence><sentence id="69">So the message of doom, at least for my father, was quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="70">It didn't...it took one incident. </sentence><sentence id="71">My father was riding by <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="73">And another person came into his <span class="interior space">compartment</span>--a German who traveled to <span class="country">Germany</span>, too--and after the <span class="spatial object">train</span> started to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out, [the] Volkischer Beobachter. </sentence><sentence id="74">My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="75">He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man. </sentence><sentence id="76">He saw this, my father really angry. </sentence><sentence id="77">He took his <span class="spatial object">briefcase</span> from out of the <span class="spatial object">rack</span> and told this guy, "I don't want to share my <span class="interior space">compartment</span> with a man who reads the Nazi paper." </sentence><sentence id="78">That's what the kind of person my father was. </sentence><sentence id="79">Because he addressed the right person. </sentence><sentence id="80">This person was actually his replacement. </sentence><sentence id="81">You know, he was on a visit to <span class="populated place">Bydgoszcz</span> to talk to my father how he would take this over, you know. </sentence><sentence id="82">And later on, a day or two later, he met him. </sentence><sentence id="83">This guy came visiting and said, "I am <span class="building">Consul</span> [Bernhard (ph)]."_ </sentence><sentence id="84">And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting; and my father was relieved of his position in a week's time. </sentence><sentence id="85">This guy had gone back to <span class="country">Germany</span> and wrote up the incident in the <span class="interior space">compartment</span>; and that really fixed my father's future for good. </sentence><sentence id="86">My father, of course, didn't need that job at all. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was really uh more bother than reward. </sentence><sentence id="88">He ran his <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">But then the recession came and <span class="country">Poland</span> was very hard hit. </sentence><sentence id="90">My father was German citizen living on a passport. </sentence><sentence id="91">So the Poles said, "Mr. Kniiemann, why don't you go back to <span class="populated place">Brandenburg</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="92">That is what <span class="country">Germany</span> was called in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we got an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of 1932 to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father could have gone to <span class="populated place">Essen</span>; but <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> was the next <span class="populated place">city</span>, really big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">And he had probably better opportunities to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="96">But he was in error. </sentence><sentence id="97">He came and he was told, "No job for you. " </sentence><sentence id="98">Because of his remark. </sentence><sentence id="99">And Hitler was not even in power then. </sentence><sentence id="100">But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic positions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not. </sentence><sentence id="101">So my father never got a job offer. </sentence><sentence id="102">He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: How did you survive financially? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: He was...he was actually a veteran. </sentence><sentence id="176">But being a German national, he had actually abdicated his right for pension because "I don't go and collect from my father[land]. " </sentence><sentence id="177">That was the attitude. </sentence><sentence id="178">An idiot, of course. ( </sentence><sentence id="179">Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick. </sentence><sentence id="180">He had TB, open TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a <span class="building">veteran's hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">And his pension was restored, but on a level about 50% disability. </sentence><sentence id="182">But he was really 250% disabled, really. </sentence><sentence id="183">So he spent uh half a year in the <span class="building">hospital</span>; was operated several times, of course, to no avail. </sentence><sentence id="184">But the acute conditions were removed. </sentence><sentence id="185">My mother and my sister and I, we lived in <span class="interior space">apartment</span> which cost as about 80% of our income. </sentence><sentence id="186">And when we came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, people didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="187">They thought we were criminals. </sentence><sentence id="188">Kicked out from <span class="country">Poland</span> for not paying  taxes, or stealing something, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="189">I mean, the Germans to me were completely insensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Why did they think that you were criminals? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: They thought I had a Polish accent. </sentence><sentence id="208">That is enough. </sentence><sentence id="209">You know, (laughing) people have funny notions. </sentence><sentence id="210">If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player. </sentence><sentence id="211">Hungarians can play violins very well. </sentence><sentence id="212">Most, I guess, don't play violins. </sentence><sentence id="213">But being of Polish, being...having this title "Polak"...And I, as a child going into <span class="building">Berlin school</span>, was treated as a Polak. </sentence><sentence id="214">My German was really quite good, but not perfect. </sentence><sentence id="215">I had a Polish accent and also uh didn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German. </sentence><sentence id="216">So when this happened, I sit down and really learned German. </sentence><sentence id="217">And actually better than most Germans. </sentence><sentence id="218">I really speak even today better German than most Germans. </sentence><sentence id="219">Definitely! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Tell me about your <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="234">You brought some photographs with you. </sentence><sentence id="235">Tell me about the birth certificate you have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="240">Here is my Polish birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="241">This is a major obstacle in my whole life. </sentence><sentence id="242">When people ask me, "What are you?" </sentence><sentence id="243">I say "Polish." </sentence><sentence id="244">They say, "No, your German gives you away. </sentence><sentence id="245">You are German." </sentence><sentence id="246">And, of course, here in <span class="country">America</span> I am now American citizen. </sentence><sentence id="247">Often people say, "But you have an accent." </sentence><sentence id="248">Then I say, "Yes, I was born Polish." </sentence><sentence id="249">And they say, "No, you have a German accent." </sentence><sentence id="250">I say, "Unfortunately, I suffered from being born in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">Because I had to immigrate here. </sentence><sentence id="252">The quota was full, and no entry for me in this <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">For long years, you know, I... So you get hit, no matter what you are. </sentence><sentence id="254">If you are different, you get it. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I learned that in <span class="country">Poland</span>, even when I was born, the kids came and met this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had when they saw something who was different from them. </sentence><sentence id="256">And it's everywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: You have other things as well. </sentence><sentence id="276">What is that you have now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to <span class="building">university</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: You want <span class="env feature">water</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="284">So this took also some doing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="285">I had avoided joining <span class="building">Nazi Youth Organization</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="286">I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="287">Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the sickest kid on the <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">So they got easy on me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="289">And uh besides, legal speaking, my age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it. </sentence><sentence id="290">The law actually uh spared those born before 1924. </sentence><sentence id="291">So I was born "22, and didn't encounter much trouble. </sentence><sentence id="292">But the authorities, when lL applied going to...to--let's say, <span class="building">college</span>--would call, they said, "You are not member of any Nazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know. </sentence><sentence id="293">Only we...are only interested in people who become leaders here." ( </sentence><sentence id="294">Laughter) I said, "I am not very much interested being a  leader, anyway." ( </sentence><sentence id="295">Laughter) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Show me what else. </sentence><sentence id="310">You have some photographs of you growing up. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now these would be in <span class="country">Poland</span> as a young child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="316">Here, that's the height of my career! ( </sentence><sentence id="317">Laughter) I always tried to climb up that tree.(Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture. </sentence><sentence id="318">I was 2-1/2 years old. </sentence><sentence id="319">So this was taken in 1924. </sentence><sentence id="320">This was my highest point in my career. </sentence><sentence id="321">I was really proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="322">You can see the <span class="dlf">branches</span> all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up. </sentence><sentence id="323">You see, I'm restless. </sentence><sentence id="324">am a go-getter. ( </sentence><sentence id="325">Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father immigrated, not immigrated, this <span class="region">area</span> was German under the Kaiserreich and the were interested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live there. </sentence><sentence id="326">So people wanted to expand, get a new <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">My uncle had done so. </sentence><sentence id="328">He was from <span class="populated place">Essen</span> in <span class="region">West Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">And my father went to <span class="country">Poland</span>--or at that time it was <span class="country">Germany</span>--to beat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's <span class="building">firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="330">So, where they came from.. My father was the 24th child, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="331">The woman had two husbands. </sentence><sentence id="332">Of course, in succession, not at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="333">Although one could think...But there was no child after him. </sentence><sentence id="334">That was the end of the <span class="dlf">line</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="335">Laughing) But the <span class="building">house</span> where my family comes from was built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in <span class="populated place">Eisenberg</span> or <span class="populated place">Poleberg</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="336">And I have just met people from <span class="populated place">Eisenach</span>, and they say, "Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the Kniiemann family, and they lived next to this <span class="building">house</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="337">Was taken by my father, I think, in 1923 or so. </sentence><sentence id="338">And these are my grandparents sitting in front. </sentence><sentence id="339">My grandfather was uh miner. </sentence><sentence id="340">There were these many children. </sentence><sentence id="341">One could only operate the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, so the others naturally went into the...under...into the <span class="dlf">mines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">My grandfather worked there 73 years. </sentence><sentence id="343">And on the day of his retirement, he collapsed and was dead. </sentence><sentence id="344">Real great thing to have a <span class="spatial object">pension</span> waiting for you. ( </sentence><sentence id="345">Laughing) And they kept it all, you know. </sentence><sentence id="346">And another distinction my family had, my father was a veteran in the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="347">Lung shrapnel hit him. </sentence><sentence id="348">My grandfather--a veteran of 1971"--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the <span class="region">Prussian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="349">The French were...My grandfather, the same injury. </sentence><sentence id="350">In the war with Prussia/<span class="country">Austria</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">degSo same...almost the identical. </sentence><sentence id="352">I am first one without an injury. </sentence><sentence id="353">I think I learned a lesson from the past, you know. </sentence><sentence id="354">My father said, "If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come <span class="building">home</span> I beat you up like you never have been." ( </sentence><sentence id="355">Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his son to stand for this Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="356">He considered Hitler simple gangster. </sentence><sentence id="357">Nothing else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="358">He took everything and gave nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Tell me about...Tell me...You have one more picture there I want to show, about a <span class="building">school</span> woman. </sentence><sentence id="407">And I would like you to talk about your father. </sentence><sentence id="408">Yeah, that one. </sentence><sentence id="409">Tell me about that and the photographs. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: This is...my schooling started in a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="411">I think this was a second year in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">It was a normal... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Tn <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: In <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">Was a normal <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="417">Was still. . </sentence><sentence id="418">it was 1934 when I entered this. </sentence><sentence id="419">I was a little late. </sentence><sentence id="420">I was a year older, or two years older, than the rest of my...Because of my transfer from <span class="country">Poland</span>, I had only Polish as a foreign language. </sentence><sentence id="421">And not French or Latin, or so. </sentence><sentence id="422">So I had to go back. </sentence><sentence id="423">Also, my German was not that great. ( </sentence><sentence id="424">Pause) They found. </sentence><sentence id="425">And uh so this teacher was a Doctor [<span class="populated place">Dunmever</span> (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="426">A very strange occurrence. </sentence><sentence id="427">He was a hunchback. </sentence><sentence id="428">And, of course, like anyone in <span class="country">Germany</span> who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback, cross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen. </sentence><sentence id="429">And this man, because of his...I think, of his constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously kind. </sentence><sentence id="430">A person who... (sobbing) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="447">Q: Take a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: ...you could only love. </sentence><sentence id="450">And then this broken system came in, and this man was almost destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="451">You could feel it, that he was not Jewish or anything. </sentence><sentence id="452">But he knew me--as being what I am, I presented a target for these gangsters who came in. </sentence><sentence id="453">I was defective. </sentence><sentence id="454">Well, just before this picture was taken, maybe a day or two before, our <span class="interior space">room</span> was decorated with romantic scenes of <span class="env feature">landscape</span> and quieting pictures. </sentence><sentence id="455">In the middle of class, suddenly two workmen come in with a great stack of pictures. </sentence><sentence id="456">And you can see these pictures here. </sentence><sentence id="457">They represent <span class="spatial object">German warships</span>, <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, military pictures.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1788">A: I mean, to get out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1789">But I also was ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="1790">I had met, a half a year or so before, a Dane in a <span class="building">restaurant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1791">I did know he was a Dane. </sentence><sentence id="1792">He looked like anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="1793">But we...I ate and he ate in a specific <span class="building">Nazi restaurant</span> where you could get everything. </sentence><sentence id="1794">I had enough money from and noticed the accent.

id="1805">And they promise them at the end of the victorious war, of course, they will be put in place and manage these <span class="building">industries</span> for the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1806">The SS had planned to actually establish its own economic base to draw money out of these <span class="building">foreign factories</span> and finance their adventures from foreign funds. </sentence><sentence id="1807">I met this man, and then I could see that was my case. </sentence><sentence id="1808">Kay Oberg was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And he, uh...I invited him <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1810">And his father had a <span class="building">delicatessen shop</span> in <span class="populated place">Copenhagen</span>.

id="1827">Because to be a morse operator...And I was deaf. </sentence><sentence id="1828">They didn't ask me that.(Laughing) And I thought I will not tell them (laughing) until I sit and fall, because I had in mind that I can go to the other <span class="region">sides</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1829">I came there and I faked it. </sentence><sentence id="1830">I even did the qualification for <span class="building">morse code school</span> and all that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1831">But I had contacted <span class="populated place">Oberg</span> and said I am here. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And I expected actually that they would give me an address where to turn to, but it was not necessary. </sentence><sentence id="1833">I came into this new <span class="building">company</span>; and there was lots of Poles, ethnic Poles, and ethnic Frenchmen. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And the manager of the <span class="building">canteen</span> in the company was a Frenchman from <span class="region">Alsace-Lorraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1835">You know how it was, you wouldn't believe it, how you recognized each other, that you were anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1836">I went into the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1837">I left, and he said the same dirty laugh; and I knew exactly that was the man. </sentence><sentence id="1838">You know that, nothing like in <span class="populated place">Hollywood</span> film, code words, you know you forget code words by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1839">That is a very great danger. </sentence><sentence id="1840">You know, you have other things to worry about and, uh, now the code word. </sentence><sentence id="1841">You are shot before you remember. </sentence><sentence id="1842">But here it was just that you recognize this man at least wanted to have a life style which was yours. </sentence><sentence id="1843">That you knew that yours and his were non-Nazi so that was all it took. </sentence><sentence id="1844">You could talk to these people at once without identification and so I went, after hours, to the <span class="building">canteen</span> and look my desire is to do anything to damage the <span class="building">Nazi factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1845">Finally, I think I would like to go to <span class="country">Sweden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1846">No problem, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1847">I told him that I had connections in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> for weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1848">I mean I could buy machine guns, anything. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Like here, it's forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="1850">But actually Nazis were not that crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1851">They...[ mean you could have weapons, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1852">My father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And, uh, since there were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Besides, the Nazis really thought that they controlled everything. </sentence><sentence id="1855">They had no...they didn't even have a suspicion that there was a segment of the population really going after them. </sentence><sentence id="1856">They didn't know this. </sentence><sentence id="1857">I mean there was the <span class="region">West</span> that they contributed...you see that they were the victims of their own philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="1858">They thought Jews were the typical resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1859">There was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a fighter because people, officials...you looked Jews, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1860">I don't know some Jews I know looked more, they  9 looked more like <span class="populated place">Siegrfied</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1861">But they looked for that type you know. </sentence><sentence id="1862">I mean everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1863">In all <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1864">If they were gypsies, a chicken is stoled, and a gypsy was there a week ago, he did it. </sentence><sentence id="1865">There was always a minority which can be easily recognized. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Round up the usual suspect. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Like in the <span class="populated place">Casablanca</span> film, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1868">If they didn't find any of them, it was, uh, Jews do it any how. </sentence><sentence id="1869">But in this case here, these Frenchmen, the ethic French men, they were not trusted. </sentence><sentence id="1870">But they were sent for occupation duty in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1871">The Poles were not trusted. </sentence><sentence id="1872">They were sent for occupation duty in <span class="country">Denmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1873">So, there was need for weapons and I had the military pass. </sentence><sentence id="1874">My father (laugh) conveniently got sick. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and bought two big <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> full of pistols. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And I repeated it several times. </sentence><sentence id="1877">I...you see at that time, the Nazis collected weapons from civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as souveniers from war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And these women were impressed if they would be caught by, for instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times, mangled, (laugh) and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons in, you know, and I stood outside the <span class="dlf">collection point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1880">I know even the place, it was <span class="building">Horst Wessel Platz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1881">It was actually former headquarter of the communist party in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1882">It had been turned into the <span

stood in front of this, in my uniform, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1884">I said, "I come right from the front. </sentence><sentence id="1885">You know what we need. </sentence><sentence id="1886">We need more weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1887">You know the German army is not providing us with pistol, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1888">When the enemy comes running up to you, you cannot use your rifle. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I give you five dollars." ( </sentence><sentence id="1890">laugh) In 30 minutes, I had 2 big <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I couldn't even carry it, but I was soldier, I was, of course, a front soldier in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, eating whip cream by the gallon and so I delivered. </sentence><sentence id="1892">That French man, he just gobbled it up. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Actually, these Frenchmen had full uniforms already for the loss of the war and at once established a French army unit in <span class="country">Denmark</span>, out of the German army. </sentence><sentence id="1894">And, of course, he had the connection with the Danish Army, and so...I went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> 3 times, did this and always with the <span class="spatial object">Wehrmacht train</span>, the <span class="spatial object">military train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1895">It was never controlled. </sentence><sentence id="1896">You could actually take anything you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And the Danes were happy. </sentence><sentence id="1898">I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="1899">I brought butter to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and so forth you know. </sentence><sentence id="1900">And so I was never afraid really. </sentence><sentence id="1901">It was...if you know, if you do it for the right cause, nothing stops you. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And whenever it comes, the threat of this thing and you have your right cause, do it. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Don't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Do it. </sentence><sentence id="1905">You know, it's. . </sentence><sentence id="1906">nothing is better than doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1907">Trying to abolish it. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Even if this is go yet. </sentence><sentence id="1909">You just throw the stone where it hurts. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And you know yourself you never can, uh, uh, let this guy fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1911">But you might hit where it hurts, and you are finally getting through with your message. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So not that much difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="1913">You see...I think human beings are too civilized. </sentence><sentence id="1914">I think maybe, in part, <span class="country">Israel</span> is a good example. </sentence><sentence id="1915">They do it, against all odds. </sentence><sentence id="1916">It's the only <span class="country">country</span> which does it, I mean in my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1917">But I think anyone can do it if he just wants it. </sentence><sentence id="1918">If he sees the danger which is directly against him, what he is running into. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Don't run into it. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Abolish this danger. </sentence><sentence id="1921">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2318">A: Yah. </sentence><sentence id="2319">Strange relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2320">My mother was, of course, sort of an angel really. </sentence><sentence id="2321">She helped everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Now when it came to our attention or people came to us or to our friends, they needed immediate help. </sentence><sentence id="2323">Something had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="2324">A visa had to be gotten to exit <span class="country">Germany</span> or somebody was in the <span class="populated place">KZ</span> and maybe a case could be made to release them again. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And there comes in my father's career as a pilot. </sentence><sentence id="2326">As I said before, he was assigned a sergeant who trained him to become a soldier, and, uh, this man was just a sergeant, a professional soldier, and when we moved from <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, he worked and had risen to a pretty prominent position as a civil servant in the <span class="building">Veterans Administration</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2327">But my father needed to have his pension restored, so this man helped him, but this man had turned into a raving Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="2328">But because as a old comrade so he overlooked the anti-Nazi attitudes of my father, and rehelped him getting his pension and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2329">They met once. . </sentence><sentence id="2330">and then my father discovered that he had married a wife who was born in the <span class="populated place">hometown</span> of Mrs. Himmler's wife. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And somehow, this man's name, this Veteran's Administration official, had the heroic name Feige which means in English coward. ( </sentence><sentence id="2332">laugh) This was really a laugh, but as they...He had indicated he wanted to meet with my parents and so on to do the right thing...became sort of acquaintances. </sentence><sentence id="2333">I think my parents were there socially once. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And they never came and visited us. </sentence><sentence id="2335">But Feige had moved from the <span class="building">Veterans Administration</span> once Hitler came in and had become Goebbels assistant. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Of course, it helped to know Mrs. Himmler, that was for sure. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And, he. . </sentence><sentence id="2338">he is also listed in the government publications as being Goebbels Ministerialrat, one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2339">But he had influence. </sentence><sentence id="2340">But we saw also a possibility to influence Himmler, because Mrs. Feige or this coward's wife, she being the school mate of Mrs. Himmler met with her once a week and both ladies played Bach on a <span class="env feature">harmonia</span>, on a miserable <span class="env feature">harmonia</span>, in Feige's <span class="building">household</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And this too...I mean non-political people, they didn't care about one thing or the other...only Bach. </sentence><sentence id="2342">So Bach was right. </sentence><sentence id="2343">And they played for 2, 3 hours on the <span class="dlf">harmonia</span>, and departed but, of course, like some women do they chat a lot and all this, so we could see that there was a possibility to influence Himmler and when we got really...and I mean we, that means my mother, of course...got cases where nothing would have. </sentence><sentence id="2344">My mother called Mrs. Feige, and said, "I have here a terrible case, you know, once a personal acquaintance of friends of mine. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Although we know these are difficult times and so on, what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="2346">Can you tell Mrs. Feige his name is so and so and so and so. ( </sentence><sentence id="2347">laugh) Can you do something. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Tell Mrs. Feige. </sentence><sentence id="2349">She can tell her husband. </sentence><sentence id="2350">We guarantee you this is completely justified and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2351">In most cases, this worked. </sentence><sentence id="2352">I mean these were not really prominent cases, but say this, but prominent people, let's say economics was enough to get killed by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="2353">In their book it was a crime of major proportions. </sentence><sentence id="2354">But Himmler wanted to keep up apparently his image like a normal man also. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And, of course, his wife probably had a lot to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="2356">She was probably nagging him and he conceded and then my mother got a call from the <span class="building">Himmler headquarters</span>, <span class="building">Sicherheitshauptamt</span>, that she was called to pick up the visa for so and so. </sentence><sentence id="2357">My mother has absolutely no fear. </sentence><sentence id="2358">I mean she has nerves like steel. </sentence><sentence id="2359">She can sleep in the most trying circumstances, and she just went there. </sentence><sentence id="2360">To go in there  4 was a very big favor alone you know. </sentence><sentence id="2361">These SS guys, they knew that Himmler had something to do with my mother's coming, got up, saluted here, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2362">And my mother looks like Mrs. zero. </sentence><sentence id="2363">She does not arouse any interest. </sentence><sentence id="2364">She was just about, if Himmler would let in, let's say a Jewish woman who was alive but in his mind, but already dead. </sentence><sentence id="2365">That's how my mother looked. </sentence><sentence id="2366">She looked completely nonentity. </sentence><sentence id="2367">She got the visas. </sentence><sentence id="2368">They saluted. </sentence><sentence id="2369">My mother marched out. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Case closed. </sentence><sentence id="2371">You know, and that...I don't want to make propaganda for Himmler, but there is a side you probably would not have expected. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Not everybody has connections to the wife of a dictator, but if you do, there is a chance you get somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2373">So we used to...1 1 mean some of the 20th of July people also got arrested and needed to get out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2374">My mother got them out. </sentence><sentence id="2375">Jewish people or professors and so on, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2376">So Mrs. [Heumner (ph)]...we got them out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2438">A: Yah, Mrs. Feige, Mrs. Himmler, and Mr. Himmler finally. </sentence><sentence id="2439">I mean it is unbelievable, I mean, to me, even today. </sentence><sentence id="2440">I mean I wouldn't...you know being a youngster I might have gone into the <span class="building">Reichssicherheitshauptamt</span>, but anyone over 20 would not, because that was a place not to be. </sentence><sentence id="2441">For no reason. </sentence><sentence id="2442">And that was that. </sentence><sentence id="2443">I mean, you see it takes courage and the nerve to stay on your charted course. </sentence><sentence id="2444">You know a dictators really dislike enemies, but they dislike enemies who waver, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And actually, if you are staying on your course, they are not suspicious because you act like them almost. </sentence><sentence id="2446">You see they don't waive, they don't give in on anything. </sentence><sentence id="2447">And you appear as if you are ready to get what you came for and then they give you a break. </sentence><sentence id="2448">I think it's the similarity of format you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2460">Q: You have brought...you have got pictures here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2462">A: Yah, by looking through my <span class="spatial object">pictures</span>, to my astonishment I see a picture which I have never seen. </sentence><sentence id="2463">Somehow it, I thought it is a friend and former colleague of my father, Mr. actually Albert Gunter. </sentence><sentence id="2464">He called himself usually <span class="populated place">Albougie</span>. ( </sentence><sentence id="2465">ph) It's a picture here in <span class="populated place">Szopot</span> near <span class="populated place">Danzig</span>, a <span class="building">resort</span>, <span class="building">seaside resort</span>, with his daughter and wife, a very elegant woman and a very sweet girl. </sentence><sentence id="2466">But he was...he was, you know, as you can see, a typical family picture, at a summer vacation at the <span class="env feature">Baltic Sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2467">Uh, this man had worked in my uncle's office...in my uncle's <span class="building">factory</span> as sales manager trainee, as has my father, who went out. </sentence><sentence id="2468">They became friends naturally and when this <span class="region">area</span> became Polish again he went to <span class="country">Germany</span> and joined a company in <span class="populated place">Stettin</span>, which produced <span class="spatial object">bakery ovens</span>, <span class="spatial object">bakery equipment</span>, and that sort of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2469">My father kept on and off, you know, contacts and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2470">When we came to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, moved to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, he came visiting us, you know, sort of see how we are doing, and I think it was in 35 or so, this picture is 36. </sentence><sentence id="2471">He came in and I overheard the conversation, and he said, "Carl, Imagine! </sentence><sentence id="2472">I got an order for I think it was 50 <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> for the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Oranienburg</span>, near <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2473">What do you think? </sentence><sentence id="2474">Do they expect that many prisoners?" </sentence><sentence id="2475">50.These were <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> to bake bread. </sentence><sentence id="2476">At that time, it was who knows. </sentence><sentence id="2477">It looks quite dim if they need that much bread, they probably get so and so many people and so actually, the existence of <span class="populated place">KZ concentration camp</span> was known all over <span class="country">Germany</span> by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2478">That is  5 simply not true what Germans say now, in my opinion at least. </sentence><sentence id="2479">I knew it the first day. </sentence><sentence id="2480">Why shouldn't intellectual Germans know it the second day. </sentence><sentence id="2481">No, it was better not to know. </sentence><sentence id="2482">But this man had some misgivings about this firm, was <span class="building">Kirst und Soehne</span>, from the <span class="building">Sttetin</span>, was probably the fifth or so largest producer of <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2483">And, after awhile, Mr. Gunter came visiting us again and they ordered even more, and he indicated that they are using these <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> to not bake bread, but to burn corpses. </sentence><sentence id="2484">He was really shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2485">I mean if you got news of that kind in <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>, you were really not much shocked you know. </sentence><sentence id="2486">You knew they did everything imaginable, mean to people. </sentence><sentence id="2487">But he was shocked, and he slightly felt responsible, I think, that he had lent his hand, maybe in the beginning, of course, not knowing what this was for. </sentence><sentence id="2488">These <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> were regular <span class="spatial object">baking ovens</span> as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="2489">I mean I have seen films...I have seen films actually with the firm's label on the <span class="dlf">door</span> of these <span class="spatial object">ovens</span> and I don't think they were modified for this new type of application so. . </sentence><sentence id="2490">but, of course, knowing it, that its use to it, possibly I mean, actually, I wouldn't have gone through with it. </sentence><sentence id="2491">I would have retired or something, but he went to apparently to the very last and, uh...in 44, he called on our <span class="building">home</span>, <span class="dlf">apartment door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2492">My mother was gone, my father was out of the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and he talked to me and this man broke completely down. </sentence><sentence id="2493">He said, "What have I done?" </sentence><sentence id="2494">I must tell you I was not a friend to him. </sentence><sentence id="2495">You know he was much older and somehow, this man was sO nervous, so super nervous, he said. . </sentence><sentence id="2496">what have...and he asked me...I was what...I was 20 years old...and I was so embittered to see a man before me that I said, "Mr. Gunter, the only thing you can do...commit suicide." </sentence><sentence id="2497">It was terrible for me to say it, but I knew everything. </sentence><sentence id="2498">Not from him, but from...of course, you knew everything. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And for me, having somebody before me, an intelligent German man, having done this did not say no, I mean, he probably could have invented hundreds of reasons...so I was really...maybe it wouldn't have been my style...I said you have nothing else to do but commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="2500">By the way, he did. </sentence><sentence id="2501">Not that I have great power of persuasion, but he felt that's the only thing you can do. </sentence><sentence id="2502">Things which have been done, you lent your hand, your talent, you knew, at least along the <span class="dlf">line</span>, that you actively supported, for me this was your death. </sentence><sentence id="2503">It would have been my death. </sentence><sentence id="2504">That's why I simply had a very strong commitment not in any way support this system. </sentence><sentence id="2505">It was my life really because if they kill others, they kill you. </sentence><sentence id="2506">Nobody has to get killed for political reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2507">And I knew if I am in it, I kill myself. </sentence><sentence id="2508">I don't kill other people. </sentence><sentence id="2509">I kill myself. </sentence><sentence id="2510">It's everywhere like this. </sentence><sentence id="2511">If you see reasons to kill, do it only then when you want to kill yourself. </sentence><sentence id="2512">That is the crummiest thing you can do. </sentence><sentence id="2513">So later on, my mother lived in <span class="region">West Germany</span> and low and behold, she met Mrs. Gunter and her, by then, very pretty grownup daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2514">I mean, she didn't know about this visit, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2515">I think he never returned to her.
