<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Yes, do you remember any particular change in your life in terms of friends and <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="66">I lived on a <span class="dlf">street</span>, I remember vividly there, were four boys who were all the same age and all in the same grade. </sentence><sentence id="67">At the time I lived near a <span class="building">boy's school</span> and a <span class="building">girl's school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">It was a <span class="building">Catholic community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">Shortly after "32, about "33 or "34, they were not allowed to play with me any longer. </sentence><sentence id="70">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="71">I also was in, I think about the second or third grade, I was not allowed to sit in the <span class="building">class</span> with the rest of the students, I had to sit in the back. </sentence><sentence id="72">The teacher I had, the one I remember the best, he was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="73">But the principal was a  Nazi, because he insisted that I was sitting, that I would sit in the <span class="interior space">back</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">I only had about one or two report cards and then I was told I would not get any more report cards. </sentence><sentence id="75">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="76">And the other incident I remember quite well is, um, we had, we lived in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> where there are only ten Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="77">There was no professional teacher, and my mother used to teach me Hebrew, I'm talking about Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="78">And so as much as my mother could taught me the primers and the prayers and the alphabets, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was necessary that we went to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> over, which was a <span class="populated place">provincial town</span>, where they had a professional teacher and a <span class="building">school</span>, and most of the Jewish children in that <span class="region">province area</span> in the <span class="region">county</span> came to this <span class="populated place">town</span> on various days of the week. </sentence><sentence id="80">I remember we used to go there one day a week, and first myself and then my sister and cousins of ours. </sentence><sentence id="81">Another girl and my sister, and three of us used to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span> once a week, I think it was on Tuesday, it was the early part of the week. </sentence><sentence id="82">And we had to go by <span class="spatial object">train</span> which was probably about an hour and then you had to walk for a bit to go to that <span class="building">school</span> which was next to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="83">The <span class="populated place">town</span>'s name was <span class="populated place">Burgsteinfurt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I remember one incident in particular because there are always bullies on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">For some reason they knew that we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="86">And one day I was attacked by a boy maybe in his early teens, 15, 14 or 15. </sentence><sentence id="87">And he threw a knife at me and cut my legs. </sentence><sentence id="88">I remember coming to <span class="building">school</span> where they had bring in a nurse and they bandaid me. </sentence><sentence id="89">And then shortly thereafter I couldn't we couldn't go to that <span class="building">school</span> anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Were you alone when that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: No, my sister and our friends, my sister's friend, our cousins were with me then. </sentence><sentence id="118">And I remember that and that's about all I remember as far as anti-Semitic attack on me physically. </sentence><sentence id="119">I was beaten up later on in the middle "30s in <span class="building">school</span> by boys in the class. </sentence><sentence id="120">And then I couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="121">I went once in the years -- they took me in the early days to the <span class="populated place">city</span> swimming pool and then I was told that I could march with the class to the <span class="spatial object">pool</span>, but I couldn't be in the <span class="spatial object">pool</span> because I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="122">I happened to be the only Jew in the whole class, the whole <span class="building">school</span> of 800 children. </sentence><sentence id="123">But I remember distinctly that it bothered me a great deal that I could not be part of my friends to go into the <span class="spatial object">pool</span> once every few weeks or once a week when the class went to the swimming outing, in the summer of course, it was an outside pool. </sentence><sentence id="124">But I wasn't allowed to go in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: And when they said you couldn't have a report card anymore, did that mean you didn't do any work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Yes, I worked. </sentence><sentence id="136">I was a good student. </sentence><sentence id="137">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="138">But the principal had decided that as a Jew I was not entitled to a report card. </sentence><sentence id="139">So I sat in the back of the <span class="building">class</span> until "36 when my parents saw that it was impossible for us to live there. </sentence><sentence id="140">And we had relatives in <span class="country">Holland</span> and we left then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Do you remember discussions in your family about leaving, was it a surprise to you when you left? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: I don't remember the discussions. </sentence><sentence id="149">I remember thinking about it in depth that my father and mother thought that <span class="country">Holland</span> would be safe for us because during the First World War <span class="country">Holland</span> was kept neutral just like <span class="country">Switzerland</span> was kept neutral even in the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="150">Because the Germans needed <span class="country">Holland</span> in the First War, that's where the Kaiser ended up. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I think my father believed that the same thing would happen again because they needed an <span class="interior space">outlet</span> where they could escape to maybe. </sentence><sentence id="152">That wasn't the case because on May the 10th 1940 of course the Germans invaded <span class="country">Holland</span>, and they were there early in the morning. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="163">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="164">I know that we went late at night by <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">We went over the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: And who went? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: My father, my mother, my sister, myself, and I think my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="173">I'm not too sure. </sentence><sentence id="174">My grandmother had died, my father's mother had died in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="175">I remember because I was on vacation and I had to come back. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was with relatives in another <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">And I don't remember if my grandfather came immediately with us or shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="178">I think he didn't come until Kristallnacht, which is another story here. </sentence><sentence id="179">And he lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="180">My aunt, my father's sister, went to <span class="country">Belgium</span> to live with her first cousins, my father's first cousins in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: I was ten years old. </sentence><sentence id="205">I don't remember <span class="spatial object">toys</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206"><span class="spatial object">Toys</span> weren't as prevalent then as today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Where did you go when you went to <span class="country">Holland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: We went to a small <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="region">eastern part</span> of <span class="country">Holland</span> called <span class="populated place">Borculo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">It had about 40 Jewish families, 40, 42 Jewish families, a very religious <span class="populated place">town</span>, conservative. </sentence><sentence id="214">And it was a wonderful life for me there. </sentence><sentence id="215">It was the first time in my life that I was accepted among my peers. </sentence><sentence id="216">It was probably the best part of my life that I have ever had was from 1936, end of "36, until "40 because uh I wasn't a Jew any longer, meaning I was just one of the boys, one of the kids which I never knew before. </sentence><sentence id="217">And there were children my age, Jewish and non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="218">It so happened that one boy was my age and became my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="219">He was killed during the war with the entire family. </sentence><sentence id="220">But we had a wonderful life there. </sentence><sentence id="221">It was very difficult for my father and mother because they came with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had left everything behind. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had a <span class="building">house</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="224">We are not people of means. </sentence><sentence id="225">My father had a hard life and he worked  hard and there wasn't an abundance of money. </sentence><sentence id="226">To the contrary it was a struggle. </sentence><sentence id="227">And not on my mother's side, they were affluent. </sentence><sentence id="228">But we never felt poor of course, we had a good life in the family especially. </sentence><sentence id="229">But in <span class="country">Holland</span> it was hard for him to begin because we had to start from <span class="dlf">point zero</span> and it worked out quite well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What did he do in <span class="country">Germany</span> and what did he have to do in <span class="country">Holland</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: In <span class="country">Germany</span> my father was in business with his father, in the cattle business. </sentence><sentence id="251">Most of the Jews in that <span class="region">area</span> were in cattle. </sentence><sentence id="252">Most the majority were in the <span class="building">cattle business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">My father learned the textile business when he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="254">And when he came to <span class="country">Holland</span> it wasn't possible to go in the cattle business, that would take lots of sums of money to pay and trade, so he went back in textile, which he knew. </sentence><sentence id="255">And first he worked very hard with a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> and went from one farmer to the next for about three years. </sentence><sentence id="256">And my mother did the sewing. </sentence><sentence id="257">He sold dresses and aprons and whatever, and he came <span class="building">home</span> with the measurements and my mother worked at night and during the days. </sentence><sentence id="258">She also had a <span class="interior space">vegetable garden</span> and no help. </sentence><sentence id="259">But it was a good life. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then my father was able to buy a small <span class="building">store</span> on the main <span class="dlf">street</span> on this <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="261">Somebody retired or died, something, a Jewish family, and the son I remember sold it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="262">I don't know the arrangements. </sentence><sentence id="263">And we lived behind the <span class="building">store</span> which was a much better life for my father, he didn't have to go by <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> every day. </sentence><sentence id="264">And then it developed that my father run the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="265">He went one day a week sometimes 2 days a week, to travel. </sentence><sentence id="266">And my mother did take a very active part in the business and did the sewing and helping in the <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Did you work there too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: I had to work after <span class="building">school</span> hours. </sentence><sentence id="287">I had to deliver merchandise to the people that bought. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was the delivery boy. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was nice. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then my grandfather came. </sentence><sentence id="291">He was living with us then. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then in 1938, Kristallnacht, my grandmother came to live with us, my mother's mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Her name was Erica Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="303">My mother's maiden name was Soloman. </sentence><sentence id="304">She survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="305">She went to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">I'm sure you'll ask me about that later, but she survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="307">And my uncles, her two sons, my two uncles were arrested in <span class="country">Germany</span> by the local police in a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, a very small <span class="populated place">town</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="308">They were the only Jewish family there. </sentence><sentence id="309">They were born there. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they were in <span class="building">jail</span>, but during the night a few neighbors took them out of <span class="building">jail</span> and held up the policeman who was their friend actually, and they took "em by <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> over the <span class="dlf">border</span>, and took "em over the <span class="dlf">border</span> to get "em from not being taken to one of the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, wherever they were taking them in those days, probably <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they were immediately put under house arrest in <span class="country">Holland</span> by the Dutch government. </sentence><sentence id="312">And they lived with another cousin of ours. </sentence><sentence id="313">My mother uh, my grandmother rather, I think and her two sisters married in <span class="country">Holland</span> and had their children. </sentence><sentence id="314">And then the  Dutch put "em in a <span class="populated place">camp</span> in <span class="region">southern Holland</span>, and then from there they were building <span class="building">Westerbork</span> which later became the <span class="populated place">transit camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">They were in <span class="populated place">Westerbork</span> from about "38, "39 on. </sentence><sentence id="316">They stayed there during the war and they were liberated by the British or the Canadians, I forget now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Bill, between "36 when you arrived in <span class="country">Holland</span> and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, <span class="country">Holland</span> is a very good country. </sentence><sentence id="335">It was a very good <span class="country">country</span> even more so then than now. </sentence><sentence id="336">Things have changed in <span class="country">Holland</span> too. </sentence><sentence id="337">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us. </sentence><sentence id="338">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding <span class="region">area</span>, my surrounding <span class="populated place">community</span> where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy. </sentence><sentence id="339">When I came to <span class="country">Holland</span> I was accepted like an equal. </sentence><sentence id="340">I always remember that. </sentence><sentence id="341">The children in my <span class="building">class</span>, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="342">But... So it was most revealing for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it didn't change radically. </sentence><sentence id="355">It took about a year in general. </sentence><sentence id="356">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span> and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on. </sentence><sentence id="357">So not immediately, but very soon. </sentence><sentence id="358">Then of course we also couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span> any longer, to <span class="building">public schools</span> after about maybe eight, nine months to a year. </sentence><sentence id="359">So we went by <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to the next <span class="populated place">town</span> over which was a large <span class="populated place">community</span> and they had built a <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">They took one of the <span class="building">schools</span> that the <span class="populated place">city</span> I think gave them and they made it into a <span class="building">Jewish day school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">And we went by <span class="spatial object">bus</span> every morning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="373">Because on the <span class="spatial object">buses</span> we had to wear a star. </sentence><sentence id="374">And when the Germans came on the <span class="spatial object">buses</span>, were public transportation systems, the <span class="dlf">rails</span> were not running any longer. </sentence><sentence id="375">law. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had a <span class="spatial object">bus system</span> between all the different <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="377">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="379">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often. </sentence><sentence id="380">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the <span class="populated place">town</span> where we went to <span class="building">school</span> I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no <span class="spatial object">buses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="381">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>, and they picked us up and took us to the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">And then they had to turn in their <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>, it was the end of that transportation system. </sentence><sentence id="383">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point. </sentence><sentence id="384">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="385">It's a little different in <span class="country">Holland</span> than it is here. </sentence><sentence id="386"> Then at one point Jews could not be in the <span class="spatial object">buses</span> at all any longer. </sentence><sentence id="387">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at <span class="building">home</span> either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="388">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">I worked there in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> as a child. </sentence><sentence id="390">My father had the <span class="building">store</span> still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier. </sentence><sentence id="391">So my father arranged that I went to work on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Anything you do on <span class="dlf">farms</span> from milking cows to harvesting the wheat and feeding the animals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Were there other children like you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: No, not on this <span class="dlf">farm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="419">This was -- other children had to do it on other <span class="dlf">farms</span>, yes. </sentence><sentence id="420">This age group. </sentence><sentence id="421">And even old people. </sentence><sentence id="422">This was mainly because information filters down and they said if you work they don't arrest you. </sentence><sentence id="423">They did anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2595">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2596">A lot of things are in my <span class="interior space">heart</span> and my soul and my mind, but I don't know anything in particular I can think of at this moment except that it was so overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2597">People say well why didn't you do something, why didn't you escape, why wasn't -- the question isn't even justifiable because in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> the fear, the electric wires, the beatings, the hunger, the starvation, the degradation, you know, the way you were treated, you never had time to think. </sentence><sentence id="2598">And then again I have to admit I'm in such a hypnosis still about that today, that now when I do remember things like chlorine, I can't stand the smell of chlorine. </sentence><sentence id="2599">When I have chlorine in the water sometimes, especially here you Washingtonians, I can't stand your water because it has a chlorine smell and it reminds me of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, and all the <span class="populated place">camps</span> for that matter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2605">Q: Why does it remind you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2665">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2666">I remember they gave us a piece of bread when we got into the <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2667">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2668">I don't know why I remember that, but I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="2669">Maybe I was very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2670">And then we went in a <span class="spatial object">boxcar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2671">I don't know how long this trip was. </sentence><sentence id="2672">It couldn't have been very long. </sentence><sentence id="2673">If it was a day or two or one day, I don't know how long it was. </sentence><sentence id="2674">I know that we ended up in a very large <span class="dlf">railroad yard</span> in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and then of course we found out it was <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2675">And this was in the summer of "43 I believe. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I don't know the dates because we didn't know dates. </sentence><sentence id="2677">The only reason we knew it was Sunday in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> was because it was selection day. </sentence><sentence id="2678">That's the only reason we knew that. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And then we were marched from the <span class="dlf">railroad yards</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to this bombed <span class="populated place">city</span>, this <span class="region">bombed section</span> of the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And there were fires still going, and there were many dead bodies laying in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> and a lot of debris. </sentence><sentence id="2681">And I remember there were no <span class="building">barracks</span>, that there were sections of <span class="building">barracks</span> laying there. </sentence><sentence id="2682">They marched us into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2683">We found out later this was the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2684">And we marked in, and I think the first couple of days we slept outside somewhere until they built this <span class="building">barracks</span>, a <span class="building">wooden barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2685">Better ones than we had in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> I must say that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2707">Q: And who built these, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2709">A: Yes, the prisoners had to do most of the work, but it was German supervision. </sentence><sentence id="2710">There were foreman there who were not prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2711">But the prisoners did all of the labor. </sentence><sentence id="2712">Us guys. </sentence><sentence id="2713">And then when we started working, and the reason we were there, we were sent there to dynamite the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to destroy all the evidence, to dynamite all the <span class="building">buildings</span>, to preserve as much raw material as we could find from <span class="spatial object">transformers</span> to cable, electric wiring, copper wiring, wood. </sentence><sentence id="2714">And a lot of prisoners polished bricks because those <span class="building">buildings</span>, and I happen to be, for a reason that I don't know why, but I was on the demolition team and we had to plant dynamite, dynamite they called it, underneath the <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2715">And then the Germans handled the plunger, the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2716">We had to set the <span class="dlf">wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2717">And I remember a few occasions they, for joy  6 rides, they'd push the plunger before the prisoners got out and got away from the <span class="dlf">walls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2718">I got hit over my legs a few times. </sentence><sentence id="2719">We didn't run fast enough because we had nothing, we didn't have decent shoes, and couldn't walk that fast because we were not that well fed. </sentence><sentence id="2720">And that's what I did for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="2721">And then for a while I did, and another groups of maybe 30 guys, we had to find <span class="spatial object">transformers</span> in <span class="building">buildings</span>, <span class="spatial object">electrical transformers</span>, and we had to put them on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2722">And that also was part of the <span class="spatial object">war machine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2723">And then I worked for quite a while in the <span class="dlf">railroad yards</span> where the <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> was transferred to and from the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, the <span class="region">Russian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2724">So that was about what we did. </sentence><sentence id="2725">And one day I remember -- oh, and my friend Hans was my helper and sometimes I got upset with him, he once said I got a good job, he said I have five people going to some work detail on the other side of the waxer to a <span class="populated place">German army camp</span>, army whatever, maybe we can get some food there because five guys maybe they feed you. </sentence><sentence id="2726">So he put me, and I remember, and I was reminded of it recently when two boys, two boys from <span class="country">Croatia</span>, from <span class="populated place">Zagreb</span>, they were very nice boys, you know, my age, and two others, and I forgot the others, I think one was a boy from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, and we went there on a <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to this <span class="building">army post</span>, <span class="building">German army post</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2727">They were all SS troops, most of them. </sentence><sentence id="2728">And we dug <span class="dlf">fortifications</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2729">We have to dig <span class="dlf">trenches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And they beat us up terribly that day, just beat us up terribly. </sentence><sentence id="2731">And two of the boys were killed that day. </sentence><sentence id="2732">One of the brothers and one other man. </sentence><sentence id="2733">So out of the five only two walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2734">So that night when I found my friend I tell him don't do me any more favors. </sentence><sentence id="2735">And so that was <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2736">And then I worked in <span class="building">Laundry</span> for a while. </sentence><sentence id="2737">And my friend he had a job of assigning detail sometimes so he was always helping me, he was always helping me. </sentence><sentence id="2738">And <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was different because we lived in this <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2739">A <span class="populated place">camp</span>, about two <span class="populated place">camps</span> they was <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2740">And they give us one <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then we built a new <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2741">We all got to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2742">So out in the big <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> there and the first <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and then during the winter, in the spring, in January there was another <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and 300 were amplified by several thousand, a lot of Hungarian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2743">And at the tail end we got out of <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2837">Q: And you were allowed to keep these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2839">A: If you could find it and could hide it. </sentence><sentence id="2840">If they caught you you were in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2841">But we also had other <span class="dlf">avenues</span>, and while we were in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> the Poles came in and bought the bricks, the polished brick, and we used to find clothes and save them bundled up and sold them the clothes for a piece of bread or a couple of onions or some garlic and even sometimes vodka. </sentence><sentence id="2842">And they brought things with them and they thought it was our's, those Poles who came in, they had this <span class="spatial object">cart</span> with a horse in front of it, so they brought in food, not because they liked us, only because it was a business deal. </sentence><sentence id="2843">I didn't speak Polish, but we had Poles who could speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="2844">And then there were what we found also was in the early days when we were in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, Jews were in the <span class="interior space">bunkers</span>, who once had done the uprising, and they were still in <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> and they came out when the dynamiting started. </sentence><sentence id="2845">And when the Germans of course saw them they shot them on site. </sentence><sentence id="2846">But I remember also one day there was a boy and a girl came out. </sentence><sentence id="2847">The Poles had been supplying them with food. </sentence><sentence id="2848">And they run out of money and out of gold and I saw a <span class="spatial object">Pole</span> kill this girl. </sentence><sentence id="2849">He killed her because he didn't want to have her alive so in case she would implicate him. </sentence><sentence id="2850">They weren't very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2851">And they were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="2852">And so they didn't help us out of any human point of view, they helped us because it served them. </sentence><sentence id="2853">And I remember we worked in the <span class="interior space">railroad yards</span> and they had <span class="country">Germany</span> material like uniforms and shoes, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2854">And we sold and traded, not so much traded, with the Polish railroad people, traded with them for food. </sentence><sentence id="2855">So the hunger was not as bad in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> as it had been in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2873">Q: What was the <span class="building">barracks</span> situation like, you said it was better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2875">A: Well, it was more modern. </sentence><sentence id="2876">I'll use those words. </sentence><sentence id="2877">But they were a little better and there also was heat, there was a <span class="spatial object">stove</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="2878">A typical <span class="spatial object">Polish stove</span> out of stone I think they were made. </sentence><sentence id="2879">I remember there was heat in there. </sentence><sentence id="2880">Not always that we had something to burn, but there was enough wood laying around because of the demolition we did on those <span class="building">buildings</span>, so it didn't cost anything to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2881">But there is one point I want to make that just came to my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2882">I happen to believe very strongly, and maybe that's in conclusion later on, that this entire issue of the Jews, <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, etcetera, the destruction of the six million of our people was a very large money-making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2883">That served and financed the biggest  8 part of the <span class="building">war industry</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2884">Because a few realize how much we were told what to bring. </sentence><sentence id="2885">You realized that every person who went through <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> that I know of, and other <span class="populated place">camps</span> I'm sure the same, and all the gas and all the <span class="building">crematoriums</span> in the different <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they looked in your <span class="interior space">mouth</span> and if you had gold fillings -- had rings, my mother had a wedding ring and my father had a wedding band, so did everyone else who were married couples, there was enormous hordes of gold. </sentence><sentence id="2886">And I remember one day in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> I found in a <span class="building">house</span>, someone had found, and we had four diamonds, four diamond stones. </sentence><sentence id="2887">Was worth about, maybe 5-6 carats of diamond. </sentence><sentence id="2888">I didn't know anything about that, but somebody said it's a very good amount. </sentence><sentence id="2889">I sold it for a little piece of bread to a Hungarian because he only got there three days before. </sentence><sentence id="2890">He thought he made a big purchase. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Well, I had the bread and I lived and he had no bread that day or for two days, so he didn't get anything for two days. </sentence><sentence id="2892">So there was so much, I mean dollar bills, gold laying on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, silver. </sentence><sentence id="2893">But the wealth of just the clothing alone, you'll see the lists that we have at our <span class="building">museum</span>, and the valuable things just pulled out of that <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and that's done in many places, that financed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2894">It was a money making event for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2895">It was a money making event. </sentence><sentence id="2896">Aside from they hated the Jews and wanted them all killed, but they made money on the deal. </sentence><sentence id="2897">The clothing, the hair was sold all over the world, recycled in some form. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2959">Q: Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had relations with 3,600 people, was it different than <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>? </sentence><sentence id="2960"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: No comparison. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Much much easier. </sentence><sentence id="2965">It was easier. </sentence><sentence id="2966">But we were under the treat of being killed by selection. </sentence><sentence id="2967">We died because there was typhoid in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> by the way, and I had typhoid, but a very mild case, and I wasn't in the <span class="building">Krankenbau</span>, in the <span class="building">hospital</span> so-called. </sentence><sentence id="2968">But I got out not very much before when the Russians broke through and got out. </sentence><sentence id="2969">But I was in there for a while, not long. </sentence><sentence id="2970">And many died because there was typhoid in there. </sentence><sentence id="2971">That's why they kept shin the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2972">There were 3,600 left at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2973">And I think at one time there was probably close to 5,000 there. </sentence><sentence id="2974">The <span class="populated place">camps</span> replenished. </sentence><sentence id="2975">That number is -- but I know it was more than 3,600. </sentence><sentence id="2976">And he was told to kill them all. </sentence><sentence id="2977">And I'm told, and this is all hearsay, that the Polish underground who was watching the <span class="populated place">camp</span> very much so because they used to take, the Polish Resistance --brought them in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and shut them in there with us -- on one <span class="dlf">wall</span> there and we had to turn them then. </sentence><sentence id="2978">The <span class="building">Polish underground</span> allegedly told the Germans that if you kall all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for them to do. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the Russians were breaking through. </sentence><sentence id="2980">So one morning they had 300 in the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> still, who couldn't get out of the <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2981">They shot them. </sentence><sentence id="2982">300, correct. </sentence><sentence id="2983">And 300 were kept there. </sentence><sentence id="2984">And the reason I know is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> Jew, and he was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300. </sentence><sentence id="2985">And those 300 were kept there to destroy all evidence, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2986">That we were told later on. </sentence><sentence id="2987">I don't know how I know, but I know. </sentence><sentence id="2988">And because they were killed while we were marching out already, they just burned the <span class="building">barracks</span> or dynamited. </sentence><sentence id="2989">It was done very very fast. </sentence><sentence id="2990">And 3,000 marched out, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="2991">Number one, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly and we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2992">And they left their corpses right on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2993">So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some <span class="spatial object">army truck</span> and they shot those people. </sentence><sentence id="2994">All men, there were no women there. </sentence><sentence id="2995">They were all men. </sentence><sentence id="2996">And we marched and here is the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came, it was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we were going like this with our <span class="spatial object">soup pan</span> and we tried to catch the raindrops. </sentence><sentence id="2997">We were very very thirsty, almost to the point of sanity. </sentence><sentence id="2998">People were going insane, people were drinking their urine. </sentence><sentence id="2999">And all of a sudden we came over on a <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, and over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> we saw a <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3000">And they took us over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> and there was a huge <span class="dlf">field</span> there, an open <span class="dlf">field</span> and we went in that <span class="dlf">field</span> apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And we pushed, the masses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000. </sentence><sentence id="3002">Of course it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third hundred, very up front. </sentence><sentence id="3003">We got into this <span class="env feature">river</span>, you could wade into the <span class="env feature">river</span> and we drank and we drank and we drank. </sentence><sentence id="3004">But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that <span class="env feature">water</span> they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the <span class="env feature">river</span> so we couldn't walk, and they wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="3005">And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would go in the <span class="env feature">river</span> and get to the other side and escape. </sentence><sentence id="3006">So they start shooting from the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> and from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="3007">They used machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="3008">They shot. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And I remember, because I wake up often, that <span class="env feature">river</span> turned as red as blood. </sentence><sentence id="3010">And the Jews wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="3011">Our people would not stop. </sentence><sentence id="3012">They kept on pushing from the back. </sentence><sentence id="3013">And they couldn't stop the Jew and these people. </sentence><sentence id="3014">On the <span class="region">German side</span>, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs  0 in. </sentence><sentence id="3015">And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the <span class="env feature">water</span> with the dogs and when the dogs got into the <span class="env feature">water</span> the Jews stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3016">They wouldn't stop for the bullets. </sentence><sentence id="3017">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3018">And then they stopped pushing. </sentence><sentence id="3019">I was out by then. </sentence><sentence id="3020">Because, you know, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the <span class="env feature">water</span> so I got out. </sentence><sentence id="3021">None of us could swim. </sentence><sentence id="3022">I don't know how many could swim. </sentence><sentence id="3023">I know I couldn't swim. </sentence><sentence id="3024">I told you I couldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3025">They never taught me how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="3026">So the <span class="env feature">soil</span> was just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the <span class="env feature">Red Sea</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3027">There's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood. </sentence><sentence id="3028">And they killed a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3029">They killed, in my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="3030">No one knows. </sentence><sentence id="3031">But there were very few who got into the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the end we got in <span class="spatial object">boxcars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3033">I know the <span class="populated place">town</span>, that much I remember, <span class="populated place">Zychlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3034">That much I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3035">Because you could see the names on there, and I remember Zychlin, so I knew that we had marched due west from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and
