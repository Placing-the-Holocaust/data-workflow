<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: There was one episode that I meant to cite and I will do it now. </sentence><sentence id="4">In those first few days of September of 1942, when the mass deportation started, my mother had been taken away. </sentence><sentence id="5">My father and my sister had to leave our <span class="building">dwelling</span> because the Germans who were shrinking and shrinking the size of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">It was hot. </sentence><sentence id="7">It was summer and there was no <span class="dlf">roof</span> over their head anymore so we lived in the <span class="dlf">street</span> for about three days and three nights on the <span class="dlf">pavement</span>. </sentence><sentence id="8">When I finally obtained my father's permission to leave him for a few minutes because I wanted to look up my buddies from the resistance movement, something which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight of me in case we don't find each other again or that one of us will be swept up by yet another <span class="building">Razzia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">I, walking down the <span class="dlf">street</span>, I ran into one of the two fellows who a year and a half before recruited me for the resistance movement Hashomer Hatzair. </sentence><sentence id="10">This was Richard, we called him Rishak. </sentence><sentence id="11">He had the look of an insane person rushing about, and I asked him well where are the leaders and where is our <span class="interior space">cell</span> and he finally gave me an address where I could find our company commander, a girl about 17. </sentence><sentence id="12">The word being Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, the taller of us three who also with him recruited me into the resistance movement, he told me that several days before the two of them were caught by the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="13">They had managed to work their way <span class="building">homesby</span> a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="14">The <span class="dlf">streets</span> were deserted. </sentence><sentence id="15">The punishment for violating the curfew was often This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="16">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="17"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection instant execution in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">So, the two of them darted into a <span class="building">store</span> front and were flat against the <span class="dlf">wall</span> when the German gendarme went by. </sentence><sentence id="19">German gendarme, who paroled the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> most of the time in addition to the SS who used to come in for forays, for selection, but mainly after 9:00 in the evening it was the gendarmes, you might call it the military policemen. </sentence><sentence id="20">They discovered them and as Richie had time to tell me in those few words with the commotion in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and throngs of hundreds of people milling about not knowing where to go what to do with themselves, waiting yet another selection. </sentence><sentence id="21">He said when the German gendarme approached them and asked them what they were doing in German, the gendarme turned to the taller Simon who was always the more combative one, the more bellicose one of us three. </sentence><sentence id="22">He always felt that when the time comes, the sooner the better that we should fight with whatever we had at our disposal. </sentence><sentence id="23">The German gendarme turned to him and called him "Du verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which means you Goddamn Jewish pig. </sentence><sentence id="24">Richard said Simon shot back and said you Goddamn German pig, at which point the gendarme shot him between the eyes. </sentence><sentence id="25">That's how we lost our closest friend, and at that point Richard, with his half insane look on his face said I got to go. </sentence><sentence id="26">I got to look for my father. </sentence><sentence id="27">I don't know where my father is. </sentence><sentence id="28">So, I went back to join my father and my sister in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Let me ask you one question. </sentence><sentence id="58">The years after that when hiding you were a catholic boy when you converted, did you have any information or contact with Jewish people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Since I jumped out of the <span class="spatial object">train</span> on the way to <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> in the first few days of September of "42, other than sneaking into two more <span class="populated place">Ghettos</span>, in the provincial small <span class="populated place">towns</span>, which This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="62">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="63"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection lasted a few weeks before the deportations there started also. </sentence><sentence id="64">Once I was on my own again, and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants, as of November "43 going to <span class="region">east Prussia</span> with new Polish documents and Polish catholic until the end of the war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="65">I had no idea what became of them except that common talk had it that they were all either having been exterminated or they're in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and that there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="66">I did not know about the <span class="building">crematoria</span> obviously at that point, but I had the foreboding based on tidbits that they're either all exterminated or about to be exterminated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: What about </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like. </sentence><sentence id="78">The entire focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that meant watching my facial expressions, my  gesticulations, my "true story"  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke to a German and I used the word for bread Broit. </sentence><sentence id="79">Broit is the Yiddish, Brot is the German. </sentence><sentence id="80">Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to speak to the Germans, | used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word. </sentence><sentence id="82">Fortunately the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the <span class="country">country</span> I was the "educated city boy." </sentence><sentence id="83">So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from the <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="84">But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: I want to get to that a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="95">Let's pick up from when you were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="96">If you can remember that for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army in <span class="populated place">Erfurt</span>, <span class="populated place">Thuringen</span>, which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which I believe was April 13, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="101">A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy of my boss, where he found a small <span class="interior space">room</span> for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we would not have to stay in a <span class="populated place">labor camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to the main <span class="building">railroad station</span>, <span class="populated place">Erfurt</span>, because that's where there were a lot of Americans. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the main <span class="building">railroad station</span> in <span class="populated place">Erfurt</span>, there were a lot of G.I.s. </sentence><sentence id="104">In front of the <span class="building">hotel</span> across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">station</span> there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to describe how it felt. </sentence><sentence id="105">A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all around. </sentence><sentence id="106">It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground <span class="building">high school</span> courses in the <span class="populated place">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="107">One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it. </sentence><sentence id="108">They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="109">When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first lieutenant Preston. </sentence><sentence id="110">That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="111">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="112"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, tall very presentable, asked me whether I knew German. </sentence><sentence id="113">I said Yes, I do. </sentence><sentence id="114">Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know some Russian. </sentence><sentence id="115">He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating apparently. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, I studied interpreting. </sentence><sentence id="117">I was then 17, for the American G.Ls. </sentence><sentence id="118">He asked me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="119">My job there was ostensibly as an interpreter and all around helper. </sentence><sentence id="120">I suppose some people call guys like me in those days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops. </sentence><sentence id="121">Within about a week later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that <span class="building">hotel</span> simply because the Americans were there. </sentence><sentence id="122">Help me with this and help me with that. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was a whole movement of <span class="country">nations</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out later some got pretty rough treatment. </sentence><sentence id="125">They were moving out. </sentence><sentence id="126">This <span class="spatial object">American unit</span> and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="127">Well, you might as well of put me on the <span class="env feature">moon</span> of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="128">By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet. </sentence><sentence id="129">There was candy and cigarettes and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="130">It wasn't until a few weeks later when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that <span class="spatial object">unit</span> what. </sentence><sentence id="131">To me they were just American soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="132">They were <span class="building">CIC</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's. </sentence><sentence id="134">So, I traveled with that <span class="spatial object">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="135">There were at the most This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="136">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="137"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ten of them in that detachment headed by Major Lobb who I was told by one of the CIC men a New Yorker or a Jewish fellow said that son of a gun, he was the judge who once found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">Major Loeb who was a prince of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope with. </sentence><sentence id="139">In the best English I could offer him when he came into my <span class="interior space">room</span> in the evening, because wherever we went they commandeered the <span class="building">German hotel</span>, I told him I was a catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these. </sentence><sentence id="140">Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in <span class="region">East Prussia</span> at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with. </sentence><sentence id="141">A foreign national, Pole or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships with a German girl, which was unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="142">Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> or severely beaten by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="143">That was to preserve the purity of the German race. </sentence><sentence id="144">So, I had had absolutely no experience with a man or a woman. </sentence><sentence id="145">Within a few days after I was liberated and I was with these American G.I.s in a <span class="building">hotel</span>  where they were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="146">One of them  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection learned that as the saying goes the <span class="building">intelligence community</span> not to mention the <span class="building">diplomatic community</span> is disportionately staffed by homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="147">My experience in the American counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17. </sentence><sentence id="148">As we drove with my liberators -- and the advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want them. </sentence><sentence id="149">The CIC detachment followed the <span class="dlf">front line</span> troops throughout <span class="region">Bavaria</span> and into <span class="country">Austria</span> almost to reach <span class="populated place">Linz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="150">As soon as the American troops occupied a <span class="populated place">city</span>, the <span class="building">CIC</span> was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them. </sentence><sentence id="151">Once we were caught in the cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next <span class="populated place">city</span> and it turned out that that had not yet been freed by <span class="dlf">front line</span> troops. </sentence><sentence id="152">Wherever we reached the <span class="populated place">city</span> and it went - - we had 13:25: gone through <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span> and a number of <span class="populated place">southern German cities</span> and into <span class="country">Austria</span>, and I remember we were stationed for a while in <span class="populated place">Ried</span>, in <span class="populated place">Innkreis</span> meaning the district of <span class="populated place">Inn</span> and the <span class="populated place">town</span> was <span class="populated place">Reid</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">As soon as we reached the <span class="populated place">town</span> that was liberated, we had four or five <span class="spatial object">jeeps</span> and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis who had been on the list. </sentence><sentence id="154">So, this was basically the job of the <span class="building">CIC</span>, that was to arrest the more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could. </sentence><sentence id="155">I have not seen any bad treatment except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat them up very badly. </sentence><sentence id="156">Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I would hear from another <span class="interior space">room</span> and he would break <span class="spatial object">chairs</span> over their heads and so on and a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when they didn't want to answer questions. </sentence><sentence id="157">Eventually, by the time that our <span class="building">unit</span> was commandeered back into <span class="country">Germany</span> from <span class="country">Austria</span>, the <span class="building">CIC unit</span> I believe was being This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="158">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="159"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection transferred or sent <span class="building">home</span> so that I was taken by one of the officers to an <span class="building">MP unit</span>, Military Police, and that was in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, with the recommendation that the MPs could use an interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="160">By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient. </sentence><sentence id="161">I was with  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 like Jews and ordered me house arrest for me. </sentence><sentence id="162">Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou throughout the <span class="populated place">city</span>, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them abominably,sometimes would lock them up. </sentence><sentence id="163">I asked him why he would he do that and he said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't <span class="country">America</span> for all? </sentence><sentence id="164">This was my dream of <span class="country">America</span>, equality, justice from outside looking in. </sentence><sentence id="165">He said, yes, except for the blacks. </sentence><sentence id="166">And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background. </sentence><sentence id="167">But his superior officer, Major, also from the <span class="region">deep south</span>, hated the Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my <span class="interior space">room</span> and bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the <span class="interior space">bathroom</span>, because the major the provost marshall put me in a <span class="building">house</span> arrest for as long as he would deliberate what to do with me next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What was the basis for house arrest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his outrage but saying this was his superior officer. </sentence><sentence id="247">I can't  do anything about. </sentence><sentence id="248">And  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 also because he was one of the MPs. </sentence><sentence id="249">Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and would bring me things to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and when I came to the <span class="country">United States</span> we became friends for years to come. </sentence><sentence id="250">So, that's another face of an American soldier. </sentence><sentence id="251">But, I never lost faith in the ideals of <span class="country">America</span> and I wanted to go there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American people as exemplified by some of the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="252">Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span> which was a <span class="populated place">Polish displaced persons camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Let me interrupt you for a second. </sentence><sentence id="262">How you experienced this, did it make you question whether you should remain catholic or admit your Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: So, when I got to the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Augsburg</span>, at the time when the population of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> had to be registered, most had lost their i.d. </sentence><sentence id="266">cards and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="267">I then had a talk with myself because there was no one I could trust or knew what name I should use. </sentence><sentence id="268">My official name was then <span class="populated place">Kutrzeba</span>, which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="269">When the time came to register at the <span class="populated place">Polish DP camp</span>, I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name. </sentence><sentence id="270">Pride in my family and my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="271"> This is

lived in the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> with one of the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of anti-semitism among my fellow Poles. </sentence><sentence id="275">It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse. </sentence><sentence id="276">So, here I was  in a <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic

was convinced that everybody I knew had perished. </sentence><sentence id="277">As I was exposed to some anti-semitism in the American army and in the <span class="populated place">DP camp</span> I reached the conclusion by myself that the persecution is going to start over again. </sentence><sentence id="278">It's just a matter of time. </sentence><sentence id="279">I could not imagine that a
