[ </sentence><sentence id="149">I had luck, because some of the engineers, they had been my | friends, <span class="building">school</span> friends, for the first years, since I was 12, 13, | 14. </sentence><sentence id="150">And so I worked there, I get money, I could make a normal living. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was until 1941 or so and between, as I was a soldier, 11 so the Germans had partly occupied <span class="country">Slovakia</span> before they started F the war against <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="152">And not far from <span class="populated place">Michalovce</span>, where I was | a soldier, it was a place where it was an <span class="building">airport</span> for the Army F only, a <span class="building">field airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="153">And you know how it is, if you are young | you sometimes get in troubles. </sentence><sentence id="154">And we get once in troubles with such soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="155">And so I get a big help from my commandant. </sentence><sentence id="156">I | told him early in the morning what happened, and he was helping .. me, but it's not important. </sentence><sentence id="157">| And from this time, as I went from the <span class="building">Army</span>, it doesn't take too many times, you could hear that something will be done with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="158">Nobody, one said that we have to go to <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="populated place">71</span>, build a new life in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">Somebody thought we stayed in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, but in some <span class="populated place">labor camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">And on the beginning of 1942 one of my friends in a <span class="populated place">village</span>, I don't remember exactly, <span class="populated place">Lustotsi</span> or so, it was. </sentence><sentence id="161">They told me, "Viliam, you have to be prepared that they will take all the young boys and girls to <span class="country">Poland</span>." </sentence><sentence id="162">I ask him from where you have the news, so he told me, "I have connections, I know it." </sentence><sentence id="163">So I was contacting my mother and told her that maybe I will go to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and maybe even to <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span> to try to go to the <span class="region">Middle East</span> because many of young people went this time from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="populated place">Palestina</span>, and to, it was <span class="country">Egypt</span>, on the front, between <span class="country">Egypt</span> and <span class="country">Libya</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a place where they have concentrated soldiers, officers, people who would run away from the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="165">My mother started to cry, "What shall I do here with the kids?" </sentence><sentence id="166">They were not kids. </sentence><sentence id="167">My brother was about 19 and my sister 16, yeah, 16. </sentence><sentence id="168">So I told my mother, "I don't know exactly, but it will be very bad." </sentence><sentence id="169">I will take my sister, Rose, with me, and she will stay in <span class="country">Hungary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">Maybe she could make a normal life in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> or <span class="populated place">Asven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And, really, it came very soon. </sentence><sentence id="172">They took the young people who was not married to a <span class="populated place">town</span> <span class="populated place">Popravitz</span> in the <span class="region">high Tatras</span>. </sentence><sentence id="173">From this place they make, they organize <span class="spatial object">transports</span> .. and send them to <span class="populated place">Midonic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="174">It was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, and to <span class="populated place">Denbrin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">The place,  <span class="populated place">Midonic</span>, according to what I, as I heard, they killed there about 250,000 young people during the half a year. </sentence><sentence id="176">They was not really killed. </sentence><sentence id="177">They must work, and they didn't get | | nothing. </sentence><sentence id="178">They couldn't sleep even in a <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179"><span class="region">Outside</span>, only. </sentence><sentence id="180">And you know how it is, it comes typhus, and then you lose every | night a hundred souls. </sentence><sentence id="181">| When I heard that it happened, I have a girlfriend, I W went to her parents and I told them I am moving to <span class="country">Hungary</span> and if you want I can take Edith and the same day I went to my mother, I told her I take Rose with me. </sentence><sentence id="182">So it happened this, my friend, | made me a meeting with the police and they told me between 10 and 11 o'clock you can pass the <span class="dlf">fronchar</span> from here up to here, kilometer, this and this, because nobody will be there. </sentence><sentence id="183">So we passed the <span class="dlf">fronchar</span>, we went to the next <span class="populated place">village</span> in the <span class="region">Hungarian territory</span> before it was <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">It was a family, we came in, they knew about such <span class="spatial object">transportations</span> because they used the people, the young people used this <span class="dlf">channel</span> very often. </sentence><sentence id="185">The girls stayed by this family. </sentence><sentence id="186">I came back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">I came to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="188">She was living in <span class="populated place">Sejose</span>, and told her that Rose is in Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="189">And the next night I moved again to <span class="country">Hungarian</span> and take her to do something else. </sentence><sentence id="190">And you know what the first question from my mother was? </sentence><sentence id="191">It was Saturday, and, "How do you came here?" </sentence><sentence id="192">I told her, "By a <span class="spatial object">train</span>." </sentence><sentence id="193">And she told me, "Today is Sabbath." </sentence><sentence id="194">It was very, very heavy for me, but it was, as I told you, the next night, with the help of my friends, I passed again the <span class="dlf">fronchar</span>, came to <span class="populated place">Michalani</span>, we had some Hungarian money, and the next day we went with a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to a <span class="populated place">town</span>, <span class="populated place">Shatarajawihe</span>, and by a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to <span class="populated place">Koshitse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195"><span class="populated place">Koshitse</span>, it was a bigger <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="region">East Slovakia</span>, about 60,000 inhabitants, and to stay there and to decide what to do further. </sentence><sentence id="196">It's, maybe it is a question of why I went so around and not straight with the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">Because the <span class="populated place">village</span> where the girls have been, in <span class="populated place">Koshitse</span>, the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went through <span class="region">Hungarian territory</span> that used to be before <span class="region">Czechoslovak territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">And custom officers went together. </sentence><sentence id="199">So it was a danger that we would be detained, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="200">So we went by <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to <span class="populated place">Koshitse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">We stayed there about three or four days in <span class="populated place">Koshitse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">The girls have been by the grandmother of my girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="203">And me and the old friend of mine, an older gentlemen, Mr. Greenstein, he helped me to get some money. </sentence><sentence id="204">So we went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and during one hour we had money for a <span class="spatial object">taxi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="205">Because for the same reasons, we have to go to <span class="populated place">Usharot</span> where we had a very large family. </sentence><sentence id="206">My mother, cousins and adult children and we wanted that one of them should go to the <span class="populated place">village</span> where we used to live before we must go to <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">Do you remember? </sentence><sentence id="208">To get some papers that we were living in this place from 1927 until 1938. </sentence><sentence id="209">It was true. </sentence><sentence id="210">But he couldn't arrange it, Mr.Greenstein. </sentence><sentence id="211">He died here in the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">We arranged the next <span class="dlf">route</span> to <span class="populated place">Budapest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="213">We were very good in Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="214">We could speak Hungarian like all other people. </sentence><sentence id="215">But sometimes it, the police made controls in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">We came from the front, from the <span class="populated place">towns</span> from the <span class="dlf">fronchar</span>. </sentence><sentence id="217">And we heard the people talk about the problems in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, what they are doing with Jewish 10 people, and that many are running to <span class="populated place">Hungaria</span>, so we have been afraid. </sentence><sentence id="218">But we came through, and in <span class="populated place">Budapest</span> I have a halfsister. </sentence><sentence id="219">We had the same father but not the same mother. </sentence><sentence id="220">The mother of my half-sister died. </sentence><sentence id="221">We came there and we asked her to help us. </sentence><sentence id="222">So my sister stayed on this place, and I went with my girlfriend, she had an uncle there. </sentence><sentence id="223">He was a very good situated man and she went to visit him. </sentence><sentence id="224">I went with her. </sentence><sentence id="225">I was sitting outside and she was talking inside, and she told my uncle don't want to help her.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q: <span class="building">Council</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="570">He spoke very good Czech because he was in <span class="populated place">Prague</span> like a student. </sentence><sentence id="571">He had a big <span class="building">drugstore</span> in <span class="populated place">Minziret</span>. </sentence><sentence id="572">He was a nice man. </sentence><sentence id="573">And they take everybody who was able to work, men. </sentence><sentence id="574">We had been about 310 girls and we went to a place called <span class="populated place">Rogosnetchka</span> and <span class="populated place">Visokov</span> where it was only one big <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575">And near to this place was beginning the big <span class="env feature">forests</span> and the <span class="env feature">river</span>. </sentence><sentence id="576">And we started to work in these <span class="env feature">forests</span> making wood. </sentence><sentence id="577">I don't know for whom. </sentence><sentence id="578">And the part of us were working to building a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> for this <span class="env feature">river</span> from <span class="env feature">wood</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was in the middle of May, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="580">Nearly to the end of July we get information that the families left in <span class="populated place">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> was taken away to, away. </sentence><sentence id="581">Meanwhile, we could go to <span class="populated place">Milingihed</span> to take what was left from ours, and so. </sentence><sentence id="582">You know why it's crazy to tell it, but the only way to come through the first month in <span class="country">Poland</span> was to sell everything what you have on you. </sentence><sentence id="583">First the jacket, then a shirt, then the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="584">Because the people, I mean, the Polish people was all so poor. </sentence><sentence id="585">And if you want to have a little milk or you want to have maybe five kilo potatoes, you have to give up a pair of socks. </sentence><sentence id="586">No money. </sentence><sentence id="587">15 So we take some things and went to, back, and then sometimes we can go to this <span class="populated place">town</span>, to  <span class="populated place">Milingihed Sporlavski</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">It was not permitted, but not on the main <span class="dlf">road</span>, through the <span class="env feature">forest</span> you can achieve it. </sentence><sentence id="589">And we went, we had some connections to a family, they had a small <span class="building">factory</span> for landscape matins. </sentence><sentence id="590">We met, his name was about Yaborchek or Yaborsky or so. </sentence><sentence id="591">And they explained to us what is <span class="populated place">Treblinki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="592">Because two brothers who went with the same <span class="spatial object">transport</span> as our families in July, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="593">We wouldn't believe that all is true what they told us. </sentence><sentence id="594">We asked if it is so that they have there so many S.S., so many Ukraine policemen, so many Lithuanian killers. </sentence><sentence id="595">How could you escape? </sentence><sentence id="596">And so the younger told me it was very easy, but others, Jewish members help us out. </sentence><sentence id="597">We are working in a group which was loading shoes, clothes and other things what the people bring to <span class="populated place">Treblinki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">And in the last <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, it was evening, we stay in the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, but they didn't close the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="599">And so when we moved from <span class="populated place">Treblinki</span> we could open the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> to jump from the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">But in a few days I heard that somebody was telling that they escaped from <span class="populated place">Treblinki</span> and the German S.S., they take them. </sentence><sentence id="601">So we have been sure, and so we have very good contact to the Polish people around. </sentence><sentence id="602">So, for example, in this <span class="env feature">forest</span> was a man, his name was Hijuc, he was very sympathy. </sentence><sentence id="603">He has a big sympathy to us. </sentence><sentence id="604">And he allowed us to make a <span class="building">bunker</span> in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and my cousin and two other men and one boy from a <span class="populated place">village</span>, I 16 don't remember exactly, but the name of this boy was Edek. </sentence><sentence id="605">He was about, say, 17, 18 years. </sentence><sentence id="606">He helped us to make the <span class="building">bunker</span>, to buy some food, I mean, potatoes and such things. </sentence><sentence id="607">And we are expecting when they came to take us. </sentence><sentence id="608">And I came not very often but once, two times a week, but in connection with a German and Polish administration of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="609">So if I would go away, so maybe it wouldn't be so good. </sentence><sentence id="610">But these three boys, they went away and they stay in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="611">And the next day, I don't remember, it was maybe a week or ten days or so, really one day afternoon came <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, Latvanian and German S.S. men, and they started to shut and take us away. </sentence><sentence id="612">They took us on the <span class="dlf">tracks</span> and they brought us, on each <span class="dlf">track</span>, to soldiers with guns. </sentence><sentence id="613">They took us to <span class="populated place">Milingihed Sporlavski</span> and we stayed on the <span class="dlf">square</span> sitting on the <span class="env feature">stones</span> and waiting. </sentence><sentence id="614">I have seen there very many awful things. </sentence><sentence id="615">I saw how they killed small children one year or so only, take by the foots and broken their heads. </sentence><sentence id="616">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="617">I knew that it is the beginning of the end. </sentence><sentence id="618">At evening we went to a big <span class="building">barrack</span> and put, we spoke about that we destroy the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="619">It was only from <span class="env feature">wood</span>, and we try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="620">But then somebody from the Germans and we saw that machine guns had been around, five, six machine guns, we .. could do it, but the percentage of success, maybe five, maybe ten percent, not more. </sentence><sentence id="621">The next day we went on the <span class="building">railway station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="622">They put us in <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">We came then to <span class="populated place">Lukof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="624">.In <span class="populated place">Lukof</span> they connected more <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">And the <span class="spatial object">train</span> went slowly, slowly, 17 slowly. </sentence><sentence id="626">We saw that we are passing <span class="building">railway stations</span> <span class="populated place">Cherletz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">And we knew that from <span class="populated place">Cherletz</span> is a <span class="building">railway station</span>, the next <span class="building">railway station</span> on the right side, not the <span class="building">railway station</span>; but the <span class="dlf">railway road</span>, is to <span class="populated place">Markeniza</span>. </sentence><sentence id="628">And before <span class="populated place">Markeniza</span> was the next <span class="building">station</span> <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="629">And we knew what <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span> means. </sentence><sentence id="630">So everybody started, we was thinking how to, what to do. </sentence><sentence id="631">And on the <span class="dlf">windows</span> on the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> they have been not covered already, but only wires with nails. </sentence><sentence id="632">So we tried to lock them. </sentence><sentence id="633">Maybe we could do it. </sentence><sentence id="634">But after <span class="populated place">Cherletz</span> we passed a main <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="635">As we came out you feel it because when you are going through this <span class="dlf">crossingways</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">So the <span class="spatial object">train</span> made a stop. </sentence><sentence id="637">And somebody opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> from outside and a German soldier came in and asking, "Schnell, schnell, schnell." </sentence><sentence id="638">And somebody gave him 500 Latien. </sentence><sentence id="639">So it was not enough for  him, so he was always urging, "More, more money, more (?)." </sentence><sentence id="640">And between we heard that the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is moving, "Whoo," that it wants to move. </sentence><sentence id="641">I don't know what happened, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="642">I was there, very near. </sentence><sentence id="643">Somebody took a <span class="dlf">wire</span> on his neck, we called it a Satirian tie, and the German was ready, he couldn't make a noise or something, and the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> was open. </sentence><sentence id="644">So it was the way for us to escape. </sentence><sentence id="645">And so the people, the boys and the older people, started to jump. </sentence><sentence id="646">And of course I have done the same. </sentence><sentence id="647">I was lying a short time until the <span class="spatial object">train</span> passed away, and then I stand up and near to me a second man that came to me, "Where we go?" </sentence><sentence id="648">I told him, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="649">I don't know where I 18 am." </sentence><sentence id="650">But I told him, or he told me, first, far, we have to go from the <span class="dlf">railway road</span> because it's dangerous to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="651">So... that, doggies. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="907">Q: Would you continue your story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: And, as I mentioned before, I was not sure if Mr. Borlinsky, or what was his name? </sentence><sentence id="910">He will come back with the money or not. </sentence><sentence id="911">So I decided to go away without money but with my, on my legs and healthy. </sentence><sentence id="912">And the next way, my way was to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> where Mr.Hichug was the boss and where we had the <span class="spatial object">bunk</span>, to my friends, and to arrive there and to try to jump on a <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, not on a <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, but on a <span class="spatial object">train</span>, to try to come backeto, not to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, but to <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="913">I was sure that if I will come back I could stay alive in <span class="country">Slovakia</span> because I had some good friends and I could have Christian papers and it would be not a problem for me to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="914">But as I came in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> to Mr. Hichug, and to this <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, to my cousin and two other boys, they told me they tried, it's impossible because on some places where the <span class="spatial object">train</span> is breaking and going slower that you can jump on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, it's impossible to go in, because the Germans are very, they are, they have special guards on these places. .. </sentence><sentence id="915">So I talked to this Mr. Hichug and he told me that maybe it would be good for you and for Edek, it was these Polish people, to make some contacts here in this part, in direction <span class="populated place">Grodava</span> in this big <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="916">I heard that there are some Soviet 23 soldiers and they are living in these <span class="env feature">forests</span> and maybe you could go to them. </sentence><sentence id="917">So why only me and this <span class="building">Edek</span>? </sentence><sentence id="918">Because the other people, they're too, I would say, too Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="919">And so I decided with Edek that we will go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: What do you mean by "too Jewish"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: You have to know that the Polish people, and even some Ukraine people, they don't like Jews. </sentence><sentence id="935">They have been, I would not say the whole <span class="country">nation</span>, but many of them have been very big anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="936">And by the word Jew, sometimes they wouldn't help you, and not only help you, but even they, it has been many cases. </sentence><sentence id="937">I could speak about the actual cases. </sentence><sentence id="938">That a family, take a Jewish family, and in the first 100 meters of the <span class="env feature">forest</span> they lull them and took away what they have. </sentence><sentence id="939">It happens, such things. </sentence><sentence id="940">So I went with Edek and we came to <span class="populated place">Gerotine</span>, and to a family. </sentence><sentence id="941">And the next night we met two Russian soldiers, not partisan this time, and we spoke to them. </sentence><sentence id="942">Ah, so and so, but have you weapon, have you this? </sentence><sentence id="943">No, we haven't. " </sentence><sentence id="944">Have you been a soldier?" </sentence><sentence id="945">I told yes, I was a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="946">I was in an <span class="building">officer's school</span>. " </sentence><sentence id="947">So come with me, come with us." </sentence><sentence id="948">And so they took us to their group. </sentence><sentence id="949">It wasn't a real group of organized partisans. </sentence><sentence id="950">I say it was a group of people who want to live, and the only one .. way how to come through was to have a gun and to fight. </sentence><sentence id="951">And because my situation was the same I didn't went to them for a reason that I will fight again Germans, becauss it, what can do I alone against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="952">But I wanted to live. </sentence><sentence id="953">And to stay in 24 2 this <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> in the wintertime, it was not very good because first of all the snow on the <span class="spatial object">bunk</span> wasn't so constant-like around. </sentence><sentence id="954">The second, if you are going here and there you will leave, yes. </sentence><sentence id="955">So I saw that even Mr. Hichug wasn't happy that we are on his <span class="region">territory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="956">I mean, this Mr. Hichug, he was the boss about the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="957">So I decided to stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="958">I told them that I am from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and so, but only the truth, because I knew that they have been so afraid, as I was, because their  1 life was not guaranteed. </sentence><sentence id="959">So we went together. </sentence><sentence id="960">They have certain places in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> where they have their <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> and what they have done, they have built some good connections with certain families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: Did these soldiers know you were Jewish at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: I didn't tell them, they didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="991">They didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="992">I, maybe that, yes. </sentence><sentence id="993">But according what I spoke to them it was about 20 people or so, I know that in name only, not in the family name, but only on <span class="populated place">Peorta</span>, <span class="populated place">Avon</span>, <span class="populated place">Volodya</span>, Rishar, and so. </sentence><sentence id="994">One man, I mean, <span class="building">Peorta Dugi</span>. </sentence><sentence id="995">He was a very tall.man. </sentence><sentence id="996">He was working like a commandant. </sentence><sentence id="997">But he was not in a shot that he was a lieutenant or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="998">He was the strongest and he was maybe clever enough. </sentence><sentence id="999">He knew something about how to move irregular. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And he was quite good in preparing, preparing material for destructions. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And this was very important. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And then, as I told, as I mentioned, they had to many families very 25 good connections to Polish people and Togram people. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And these connections was made on the fact that if they had something from the Germans so they divided it with the people around, because they had been very poor. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And except of this, they need weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The Poles, I know why, but this time I couldn't understand, because it was a big danger for them. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And so, if this group decided to do something it was not because they get some orders from higher commandant oW so. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Only to get everything what they need for their, for our living and then to show the Germans that somebody is there, is here, who can do something against them. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It was very good. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I personally had very good, also very good connections to some Polish families. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I, from the day as we came to <span class="country">Poland</span> I learned Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1011">I read newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I read books to learn the language. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Because I know that the language can help me very much if I have to live between them, because such a possibility was here. </sentence><sentence id="1014">But this winter was really a very, very strong winter, "42, "43. </sentence><sentence id="1015"><span class="region">Outside</span> it was sometimes 25, 30 degree celsius. </sentence><sentence id="1016">I don't know how much, but it's more, it's hundred, I don't know... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: Below zero, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And we have been unable .. to live so. </sentence><sentence id="1048">So some of this group went to Polish families and they have been hidden and so I told them that even I have the possibility to move and promised that in the Spring we will come back. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And I come back to this <span class="building">bunker</span>, to Mr. Hichug, but my 26 friends haven't been there. </sentence><sentence id="1050">They have been in another <span class="building">bunker</span>, in a <span class="building">stable</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1051">In such a <span class="building">house</span> where in the summertime the horses have been, the horses which were working in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And so, as I came there, we decided to go back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1053">It was not a decision, but I thought, "I am going back." </sentence><sentence id="1054">And we send, Mr. Hichug arranged us, that somebody went to <span class="populated place">Minziret</span> and was going around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to look if there is alive, or who is there, and so, and he came back and told us yes, he saw people in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the <span class="dlf">gates</span> were not closed, so that the Jewish people who stay in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> can move free. </sentence><sentence id="1055">So I decided to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I came into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but it was the end of February, middle of February. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And I met some people who I knew, even from our <span class="spatial object">transport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1058">It was a boy from the next <span

place where to live because all these <span class="building">barracks</span> have been full with people sick, and typhus was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And my cousin died on typhus on this place. </sentence><sentence id="1064">After the Spring, it was coming. </sentence><sentence id="1065">So, and we were working in the <span class="building">houses</span> where before have been <span class="building">Jewish houses</span>, and some bring all what it was in the <span class="building">houses</span> left. </sentence><sentence id="1066">The commandant of this <span

very correct and I wouldn't say that he was very lucky, what happened to part of people like 27 we are. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And he was also every evening collecting from us all the things. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Some money, what we found, or some rubles in gold, or some Polish money or some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Because we have to go through all the pieces of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And, of course, we were working something, even of our own invoice, but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And in the middle of, it could be spring. </sentence><sentence id="1074">It was spring, it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Maybe April or so. </sentence><sentence id="1076">One of our Czechoslovak, from our <span class="spatial
