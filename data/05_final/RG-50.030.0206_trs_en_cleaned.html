</sentence><sentence id="546">And it was a miracle the stone didn't...didn't hit me. </sentence><sentence id="547">So finally we arrived in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> and there was already 20,000 people there. </sentence><sentence id="548">When we came they didn't know that so many people were coming. </sentence><sentence id="549">They came from all over <span

class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="552">So we...we had to...out...the whole day sitting outside on the <span class="env feature">grass</span> and sitting and waiting. </sentence><sentence id="553">Then in the evening we went in that place and people got crazy. </sentence><sentence id="554">They had around <span class="building">watchtowers</span> and they had a <span class="dlf">electric fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="555">I remember the first three nights was worst night I ever remember because people were not allowed to go outside. </sentence><sentence id="556">The people lost their mind. </sentence><sentence id="557">They run around. </sentence><sentence id="558">There was five <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="559">They run around the <span class="building">buildings</span> and just from the <span class="building">watchtowers</span>, the people on the <span class="building">watchtowers</span> starting shooting them...shot them and the people shouted and cried and I heard that all night. </sentence><sentence id="560">But the worst thing happened the next day. </sentence><sentence id="561">We were allowed on the day to go out, but many people didn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="562">It was terrible cold. </sentence><sentence id="563"><span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> is...is high in the <span class="env feature">mountains</span>... that <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and it was special built for this purpose. </sentence><sentence id="564">What happened people went and went to the <span class="dlf">electric fence</span>..<span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">As soon as they touched them, they got killed, automatically. </sentence><sentence id="566">But not only this, everybody who touched this same person got also killed. </sentence><sentence id="567">When I saw that, how people fell down on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">When they let them laying there. </sentence><sentence id="569">And it was a terrible sight, but there was a much worse thing. </sentence><sentence id="570">It was impossible to escape from there. </sentence><sentence id="571">Every morning we had appeal at 6:00. </sentence><sentence id="572">They called us out and we had to stay  there and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole day until they found the person, brought. </sentence><sentence id="573">But some people were able to escape, and they escaped to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, and the...the German government what was already the Nazi government demanded to send them back. </sentence><sentence id="574">So the worse day was...in <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span> was when this man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the <span class="spatial

come out and watch. </sentence><sentence id="576">And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what happened. </sentence><sentence id="577">And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man. </sentence><sentence id="578">So you can imagine what the mood was. </sentence><sentence id="579">We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they wanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the <span class="env feature">stones</span> from one place to the other, to the other <span class="dlf">corner</span>, and we was busy this. </sentence><sentence id="580">The food, of course, the food were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="581">In the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and get the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought the food. </sentence><sentence id="582">But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl-- everybody. </sentence><sentence id="583">And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food. </sentence><sentence id="584">So the conditions were worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="585">We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and say "Please eat" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it wasn't kosher. </sentence><sentence id="586">So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="587">But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services. </sentence><sentence id="588">Every morning we put outside...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from the Nazis...and we had our prayers. </sentence><sentence id="589">But another thing happened every day on the <span class="building">appell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">On the morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they punched the people. </sentence><sentence id="591">So I was smart enough not to stand in the first <span class="interior space">row</span> that I didn't get punched. </sentence><sentence id="592">But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people died from starving. </sentence><sentence id="593">We was...the conditions in the <span class="building">barracks</span> was even worse. </sentence><sentence id="594">We were laying on just wood. </sentence><sentence id="595">There was no <span class="spatial object">blanket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="596">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="597">And there was some people had food. </sentence><sentence id="598">Some people had money. </sentence><sentence id="599">They could buy. </sentence><sentence id="600">So they helped the people, the others. </sentence><sentence id="601">Now we come to the first Erev of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="602">I was there; and that was a wonderful thing. </sentence><sentence id="603">We were sitting in our <span class="building">barracks</span> and sung the Hanukkah songs. </sentence><sentence id="604">And we also had prepared...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="686">In the morning, I heard over the <span class="spatial object">loudspeaker</span> my name called. </sentence><sentence id="687">And they said, "Please..." Not "please." " </sentence><sentence id="688">Come all the people..."--I was not the only one--"Come after, to the <span class="building">office</span>." </sentence><sentence id="689">So when I came to the <span class="building">office</span>, they told me that they got a paper from <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>, from my parents, that they had booked for me a <span class="dlf">passage</span> to <span class="country">Panama</span>. </sentence><sentence id="690">And that was the one what my cousin told him [that] my mother went to the <span class="building">Consulate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="691">And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason  that they let me go. </sentence><sentence id="692">So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on <span class="spatial object">buses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">They gave us even some money; because it was a long, a long trip with the <span class="dlf">railway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="694">So we went first with the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to <span class="populated place">Weimar</span>, and they put us there in that...in that <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">On this <span class="spatial object">train</span>, was the first <span class="building">station</span> was <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">That was a very big <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="697">It's very famous. </sentence><sentence id="698">There goes to there every year a very big <span class="building">fair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="699">And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the <span class="region">east</span> from <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="700">And they had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some...
