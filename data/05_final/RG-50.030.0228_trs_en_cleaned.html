<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was the <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, add the name Israel and my sister and my mother Sarah. </sentence><sentence id="130">I remember one incident probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and I made a wrong turn of some kind and a policeman came and said, "Who are you?" </sentence><sentence id="131">And I said, "<span class="building">Martin Strauss</span>." </sentence><sentence id="132">And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss." </sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, "Yes, Sir." </sentence><sentence id="134">The identification by saying <span class="country">Israel</span> (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say <span class="country">Israel</span>, it said Jew Strauss. </sentence><sentence id="135">Martin Jew Strauss. </sentence><sentence id="136">That's what <span class="country">Israel</span> said. </sentence><sentence id="137">And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a fine payable at the <span class="building">police station</span> and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten away with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="138">Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="139">Uh...<span class="building">Schools</span> no longer admitted us, or we were thrown out of <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">So the Jewish community created <span class="building">Jewish schools</span>, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we found that very comfortable, us kids, simply because we were not harassed. </sentence><sentence id="142">We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="143">We played football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a fight. </sentence><sentence id="144">Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said, "We're not playing with any Jews." </sentence><sentence id="145">So a big fight erupted between the two football teams because the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection team. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh... These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="149">It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident. </sentence><sentence id="150">And that's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living with it. </sentence><sentence id="151">It's a system. </sentence><sentence id="152">But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their occupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave <span class="country">Germany</span>, thusly saving their lives. </sentence><sentence id="153">But my father and many others was quite wealthy, very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is going to go away. </sentence><sentence id="154">We're going to wait. </sentence><sentence id="155">Even if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still some big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special." </sentence><sentence id="156">And he said, "We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will." </sentence><sentence id="157">And thusly we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="158">My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters, followed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the <span class="country">country</span> and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders. </sentence><sentence id="159">They had enough to eat, and they were living off the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and they didn't need much. </sentence><sentence id="160">They said, "If Leopold Strauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either." </sentence><sentence id="161">And I am ashamed and with great sorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">Meaning they all perished. </sentence><sentence id="163">There are 24, maybe 26. </sentence><sentence id="164">We are not totally sure. </sentence><sentence id="165">But 24 confirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too late, meaning 1939. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh...We have confirmation of various <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> where they perished. </sentence><sentence id="167">They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their children amounting to a minimum of 24 people. </sentence><sentence id="168">They are all confirmed. </sentence><sentence id="169">That's on my father's side. </sentence><sentence id="170">On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart enough to leave. </sentence><sentence id="171">From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti- Semitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away <span class="spatial object">automobiles</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">You could not own a <span class="spatial object">car</span> anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in <span class="populated place">Leipzig</span> who had permission to have an <span class="spatial object">automobile</span> because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I. He was a decorated veteran. </sentence><sentence id="173">He had connections to <span class="building">city hall</span>, and he was permitted to keep an <span class="spatial object">automobile</span>, the only one in a <span class="populated place">city</span> of large proportions. </sentence><sentence id="174">Everybody else had to take the <span class="spatial object">street car</span>, provided he stands up. </sentence><sentence id="175">You could not sit down in a <span class="spatial object">street car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="177">It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been taken away from each individual. </sentence><sentence id="178">A little chip at a time until the time came that you had to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the <span class="dlf">gutter</span> because you couldn't walk on the side...<span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="179">And...uh...a little <span class="spatial object">chip</span> at a time until you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing. </sentence><sentence id="180">But it happens step by step. </sentence><sentence id="181">It isn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts on this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were taught to be anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="183">There were newspapers, the <span class="spatial object">Sturmer</span>, which is...I am sure we still have records of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about. </sentence><sentence id="184">But many grownups took it as...as the truth. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I...I still remember about Passover where they accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please. </sentence><sentence id="186">You can edit it out. </sentence><sentence id="187">Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for Pass...for Passover. </sentence><sentence id="188">We laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="189">But I am sure that many other people took it serious and accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="190">So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="191">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="192"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection we...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out. </sentence><sentence id="193">All ended up in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second. </sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...We had our <span class="building">Jewish schools</span> and we felt very comfortable because we were together and nobody harassed us when we went to <span class="building">school</span>, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we studied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers. </sentence><sentence id="196">And there came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on <span class="spatial object">trains</span> or on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and shoved back into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">That day I remember quite clearly. </sentence><sentence id="198">We lost many of our teachers. </sentence><sentence id="199">One thing we lost our English teacher. </sentence><sentence id="200">I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="201">The teachers were rounded up, put on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and shoved out. </sentence><sentence id="202">My teacher...uh...asked me to please go to her <span class="building">house</span> and fetch a little <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">We were very close to the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was often at our <span class="building">house</span>, which is the custom you know. </sentence><sentence id="205">The teacher is the honored person in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="206">Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's <span class="building">house</span> and got a little <span class="spatial object">suitcase</span> and threw it over a <span class="dlf">fence</span> to her prior to her getting on to a <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I was <span class="interior space">school yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">I fetched her little valise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the <span class="dlf">fence</span>, and she had it. </sentence><sentence id="209">Whatever it meant. </sentence><sentence id="210">It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation and...uh...she went off to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out of <span class="country">Poland</span>, went to <span class="country">England</span>, became teacher in <span class="country">England</span>, and now lives in <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was a miracle happened. </sentence><sentence id="213">How she got out I...I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="214">In any event, we lost a great deal of our teaching staff, and the <span class="building">school</span> after that was not any more because there were substitute teachers. </sentence><sentence id="215">They were lay...lay teachers. </sentence><sentence id="216">The <span class="building">school</span> didn't function like it should. </sentence><sentence id="217">Uh... Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents shielded us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: You mentioned that before...you told me...why don't you tell me a little bit about your Bar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="314">Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came from a fairly orthodox <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="315">Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date may not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to make a choice. </sentence><sentence id="316">Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the decision was made "no more meat in the <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="317">And my mother would keep it absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="318">Nothing doing. </sentence><sentence id="319">No meat. </sentence><sentence id="320">So we became vegetarians. </sentence><sentence id="321">Again one of those conditions steps. </sentence><sentence id="322">It's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="323">It was just one more of those <span class="dlf">steps</span> that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted that we do not break the laws of kosher. </sentence><sentence id="324">And the reason I remember this...because of my Bar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends. </sentence><sentence id="325">My father was still well known in the <span class="populated place">city</span>, and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu included kosher meat. </sentence><sentence id="326">Where do you get kosher meat?
