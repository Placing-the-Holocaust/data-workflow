<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: And then continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: If you would. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is Steve Galezewski. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born May 11th, 1923 in the Town of <span class="populated place">Inowroclaw</span> in <span class="region">northwest Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">The reason why I am talking today is I am a Pole who was born in a generation, the only generation really, in free <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12"><span class="country">Poland</span> became a free country in 1918, and then was, of course, was attacked in 1939 by <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">Being brought up in the climate of freedom, I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="14">In my childhood, I was very involved, as well as my father, in the Boy Scout movement. </sentence><sentence id="15">This is the reason why my father was arrested and eventually killed by <span class="building">gestapo</span>, because he was a leader of the youth in the <span class="populated place">Town of Inowroclaw</span> where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="16">My childhood was a very happy childhood until the year 1939. </sentence><sentence id="17">At that time, I was 16 years old, and almost, I could say, that at time I had to put the uniform and start my war days. </sentence><sentence id="18">So you can see that I missed all the <span class="building">high school</span> proms and the fun most of the <span class="building">high school</span> kids have in their last days of <span class="building">high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="19">On September 1 ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Could I just ask you to talk a little bit more about what life was like in this <span class="populated place">town</span> and whether or not you had Jewish friends ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="34">Well, let's erase the last sentence I had. </sentence><sentence id="35">In the Town of <span class="populated place">Inowroclaw</span>, the Jewish population was not very numerous like in other parts of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="36">However, there was a beautiful <span class="building">synagogue</span> with the <span class="dlf">roof</span> which we thought was gold, gold-leafed <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">One of the better <span class="building">buildings</span> in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="38">In my <span class="building">high school</span>, I did have a class of some 25, 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="39">I had two Jewish boys. </sentence><sentence id="40">I remember their names. </sentence><sentence id="41">One was <span class="populated place">Smalish</span> (ph) and the other one was <span class="building">Zowagazski</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="42">Two different people. </sentence><sentence id="43"><span class="populated place">Smalish</span> was not very athletic. </sentence><sentence id="44">He was more or less a sedentary type. </sentence><sentence id="45">The other one, Zowagazski, was involved with us in all the <span class="building">school</span> activities like soccer, basketball, and he quite often visited my <span class="building">home</span>, so I was fairly close to him. </sentence><sentence id="46">I wish today I knew whether they still alive or what happened to either one of them. </sentence><sentence id="47">When the Germans actually came to <span class="populated place">Inowroclaw</span>, I don't recall any activity against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="48">I don't remember, because most probably they had moved away from the German Army as the German Army came in. </sentence><sentence id="49">The war started for us, the Second World War started for us September 1, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="50">Two, three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up in a soldier's family. </sentence><sentence id="51">My father was a professional soldier. </sentence><sentence id="52">And two, three days before his regiment, which was the 59th Infantry Regiment, moved to the <span class="dlf">defense line</span> on the <span class="dlf">German border</span>, he called me and gave me a pistol, which was a  Walther 7.65 millimeters and had a talk with me man-to-man. </sentence><sentence id="53">And said, "Look, I am leaving. </sentence><sentence id="54">I don't know when I will be back. </sentence><sentence id="55">You are the oldest boy out of three of you. </sentence><sentence id="56">You will assume the role of the head of the family. </sentence><sentence id="57">I want you to take good care of your mother and two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then, of course, he went to war. </sentence><sentence id="59">Already after the war ended, I learned a lot of things which happens to him during that war. </sentence><sentence id="60">For instance, he was in the Battle of <span class="populated place">Kura</span>, which was one of the fiercest battles fought during that campaign. </sentence><sentence id="61">And when the entire army was surrounded by German panzer divisions near that <span class="env feature">River Kura</span>, they were already after three days of fighting without ammunition, without support of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="62">And casualties were extremely heavy. </sentence><sentence id="63">Commanding officer of the regiment, according to the write-ups in the newspapers, called my father and asked him to preserve the regimental flag. </sentence><sentence id="64">Regimental flag for a Polish soldier is something very sacred. </sentence><sentence id="65">Still today, when I see an American flag, for instance, not necessarily Polish, something grabs my heart, and I am ready to take the hat off my head. </sentence><sentence id="66">That's part of the upbringing I grew in. </sentence><sentence id="67">He, according to the versions in the newspapers and accounts of those who survived the <span class="populated place">prisoner-of-war camp</span>, he apparently broke through the encirclement of Germans and buried the flag in a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">Of course, he subsequently in 1940 was arrested by <span class="building">gestapo</span>, that's the last time we saw him, and nobody knew where the flag was. </sentence><sentence id="69">In 1985, someone with a metal detector was going through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and detected that there was something buried. </sentence><sentence id="70">They dug it out and it was a <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> and in that <span class="spatial object">backpack</span> was the regimental flag, half destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="71">It was restored and is today flying proudly in the <span class="building">Army Museum</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">When father -- when the father was arrested -- this is something which really sticks in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="73">Because the <span class="building">gestapo</span> came in early in the morning, he was not <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="74">He was not <span class="building">home</span>, and they said, "You sit down. </sentence><sentence id="75">We wait for him here." </sentence><sentence id="76">And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="77">To me, it was a horrible because I wanted to warn him and yet, here were the gestapo bandits with a woman and three young boys. </sentence><sentence id="78">And I couldn't do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="79">Father was accused of trying to break away that <span class="region">region</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span> from the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="80">Germans already considered <span class="populated place">Pomerania</span>, that part of <span class="country">Poland</span>, as their <span class="region">territory</span>, and really, that's why the war started. </sentence><sentence id="81">Because they wanted a <span class="dlf">corridor</span> from <span class="country">Germany</span> to the <span class="populated place">Gdansk</span> and to <span class="region">east Prussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="82"><span class="country">Poland</span>, of course, refused to buckle under this <span class="dlf">trap</span>, and that's how the war started. </sentence><sentence id="83">After arrest of father, we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and put in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in <span class="populated place">Inowroclaw</span>, where we were for about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="84">After that, we were put into the <span class="spatial object">cattle train</span> and shipped out of the <span class="populated place">Verdun</span>, out of what <span class="country">Germany</span> considered - - what Germans considered <span class="region">German territory</span> and were taken to the <span class="region">Warsaw region</span> and the Minsk-Suwatki (ph), the <span class="dlf">doors</span> of the <span class="spatial object">cattle wagons</span> were opened and we were let out to start a new life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: ... a few questions. </sentence><sentence id="138">You've mentioned that you had Jewish personal friends. </sentence><sentence id="139">Were you aware of a general climate of anti-Semitism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Well, occasionally in the newspaper, you would read that a <span class="building">Jewish shop</span> was  demolished, and that something was going on. </sentence><sentence id="144">But not in the region of <span class="country">Poland</span> where I come from, that's only from the <span class="building">newspaper</span> I learned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: But was it something that other boys talked about ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: No, that was never really discussed, because to us, a human being was a human being. </sentence><sentence id="150">Whether you are Jewish or -- well, frankly, they were Polish citizens anyway, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="151">So to ask, there was no difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: I'm also curious. </sentence><sentence id="156">Before September "39, what you knew about the activities of the Nazi Party ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, that's -- again, we knew that inevitably something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="160">That's why in <span class="country">Poland</span> our army was mobilized and we were somewhat prepared. </sentence><sentence id="161">To the extent that, for instance, my <span class="building">high school</span> made donations from all the students, and we purchased a heavy machine gun for the 59th Regiment. </sentence><sentence id="162">It wasn't like you have here in the <span class="country">United States</span> where you have millions of dollars for armament. </sentence><sentence id="163">Out there we had to scratch everything we could to arm ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="164">From my generation, there were some very heroic moves. </sentence><sentence id="165">We didn't have very many <span class="spatial object">submarines</span>, for instance, but we had what we called live torpedoes. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I was so proud of our <span class="building">house</span> help, because she volunteered, 18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in <span class="building">household</span>, she volunteered as a live <span class="spatial object">torpedo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="167"><span class="country">Germany</span>, of course, we knew that was fully armed, was belligerent and that the trouble will come from there. </sentence><sentence id="168">Also, their treatment of Jews was giving us indication what will happen if they ever show up in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="169">As a matter of fact, somewhere from 1936, if I'm not wrong, we opened up pretty much for the Jewish people escaping from <span class="country">Germany</span> or trying to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">We opened up the <span class="dlf">Polish borders</span> and let quite a few of them into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">I'm pretty sure that they -- except for the incidents of anti-Semitism here and there, I'm pretty sure that felt at <span class="building">home</span>, because in <span class="country">Poland</span> for 30 million population, we had some 3 million Jews. </sentence><sentence id="172">So this was a very big percentage. </sentence><sentence id="173">I don't know how many millions of Jews are in <span class="country">Israel</span>, but I'm pretty sure not much more than 3 million or maybe even less. </sentence><sentence id="174">We being prepared for a war somewhat, in <span class="building">Boy Scouts</span> on all the <span class="populated place">camps</span> to which we went in 1939, we were trying to make them on the <span class="dlf">Polish/German border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="175">And during our <span class="interior space">campfires</span>, we, of course, sung the Boy Scouts" songs, patriotic songs, always trying to warn Hitler not to try us -- not to try because we would not behave like the other <span class="country">countries</span> behaved when Hitler invaded them. </sentence><sentence id="176">We wanted him to know that we will fight. </sentence><sentence id="177">That fight came in finally on September 1, 1939, when 5 o'clock in the morning 21 <span class="building">Heinkels</span>, <span class="building">88 Stukas</span> bombed the open <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">This is the first time I saw dead bodies, not only of horses and animals, but of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="179">Up to that moment, I didn't ever even go to a funeral, so this was for me a very traumatic day. </sentence><sentence id="180">I also when I think about that day, I almost have to laugh at myself. </sentence><sentence id="181">Because the 7.65 millimeter pistol my father me, I was trying to shoot down the <span class="spatial object">diving bombers</span>, and, of course, it's a laughable thing. </sentence><sentence id="182">It  would be just like a fly going with an elephant. </sentence><sentence id="183">The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war, and I decided, although father designated me as the head of family, I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight. </sentence><sentence id="184">So I gave the pistol to my brother, who was 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="185">Gave him the same talk father gave me, and very promptly lied my age. </sentence><sentence id="186">I was 16, I had to say I was 18. </sentence><sentence id="187">And I joined the <span class="building">59th Regiment</span>, that is the unit which was being organized in the back of the <span class="building">fighting unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">Went through most of the fights on the <span class="dlf">road</span> from <span class="populated place">Tnowroclaw</span>, <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovel</span>". </sentence><sentence id="189">The humiliation of the villagers and population was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="190">They were simply machine-gunning women and children, bombing <span class="populated place">villages</span> which had nothing to do with the military. </sentence><sentence id="191">In the <span class="region">eastern Poland</span> where we got near <span class="populated place">Kovel</span>", Ukrainians started their own fight and started burning <span class="populated place">Polish village</span>, and started burning and killing Jews and Poles. </sentence><sentence id="192">No wonder that later on, Germans were able to organize SS Militia Division out of the Ukrainians and use them as guards in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">The war was over basically in October 2nd, 1939, and I returned <span class="building">home</span> in about November. </sentence><sentence id="194">Didn't get into the <span class="populated place">POW camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="195">Most of the Polish Army, of course, either crossed through <span class="country">Romania</span> or <span class="country">Hungary</span>, and eventually reorganized in <span class="country">France</span>; or shed their uniforms with civilian clothing and returned <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">When I came <span class="building">home</span>, mother and my brothers were already there. </sentence><sentence id="197">Thank God they survived. </sentence><sentence id="198">Father came in later. </sentence><sentence id="199">He also, after saving the flag, returned <span class="building">home</span> in civilian clothing. </sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, he did not talk about the <span class="spatial object">flag</span> at all, so 1 was unaware what was going on in that particular thing. </sentence><sentence id="201">When I was asked by the historians, I couldn't contribute much on that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Was he angry that you hadn't followed his directions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="248">Actually, we were all happy that everything finished and we were still together. </sentence><sentence id="249">Then, of course, after he was arrested and we were transported to the <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, we started a new chapter in our lives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I just wanted to ask you. </sentence><sentence id="254">You mentioned that you and your family was put in this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> for a few months or ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: A couple of weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: ... a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="260">Who all was in there with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: All the people like us who did not want to become . </sentence><sentence id="264">In that <span class="region">area</span>, Germans considered that <span class="region">territory</span> German, and they gave people an option to sign a German list. </sentence><sentence id="265">Yes, I am a German. </sentence><sentence id="266">And we considered ourselves Poles, and we did not want to become Germans. </sentence><sentence id="267">So all those people were simply taken out of their <span class="building">houses</span>, put in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, and transported to what they considered <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: And the Jews in your <span class="populated place">city</span> were in this <span class="populated place">camp</span>, as well? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: I don't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="275">I don't recall specifically seeing Jews in that <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: What happened at this <span class="populated place">camp</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: This was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> from which you either landed eventually <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span> or some other big <span class="populated place">camp</span>, or like in our case, being transported to the other part of <span class="country">Poland</span>, move them away from the <span class="region">German part</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">We were called displaced persons, DPs as they called them, they called us after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Do you remember exactly what your family thought about what was going on, why you were being moved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well, father, of course, was gone. </sentence><sentence id="285">With mother, talking about things of that was -- well, it was not normal to talk to mother about things men talked about, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="286">It doesn't mean that women were not treated equally in <span class="country">Poland</span>, by any chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: No, at that age and from what I already went through, I wasn't frightened. </sentence><sentence id="293">Frankly, I wanted to fight. </sentence><sentence id="294">I wanted to revenge what they have done up to now from what I have seen. </sentence><sentence id="295">And remember one thing, that I was born in free <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was brought as a free Pole, and I couldn't stand, for instance, things we were required in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">Like at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to the <span class="building">movie theater</span> or to a <span class="building">restaurant</span> or to a <span class="dlf">park</span> where children play, a sign, "For Poles, Jews and dogs, <span class="dlf">entrance</span> forbidden." </sentence><sentence id="298">Or when I see a German walking on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>, I'm supposed to step into the <span class="dlf">gutter</span>, take my hat off, bow, and stay in that position until he moves away three paces from me. </sentence><sentence id="299">Those were not things compatible with freedom I enjoyed in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">Therefore, I was looking for a source where I could arm myself and fight. </sentence><sentence id="301">I thought about crossing the <span class="dlf">border</span> and getting to <span class="country">France</span> where Polish troops were being organized. </sentence><sentence id="302">Somehow that didn't happen, because when they let us out of in <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, we had absolutely no money. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had absolutely no time to take anything from our <span class="building">household</span>, jewelry or anything. </sentence><sentence id="304">We were simply taken out. </sentence><sentence id="305">And incidentally, into our <span class="building">house</span> or into our <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, they put Germans whom they transferred from like where they are to other <span class="region">regions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">So in one minute, you lost your entire life's assets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: What was the ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: That was like April, May 1940 -- I'm sorry, "41. </sentence><sentence id="325">Not so sure, not so sure. </sentence><sentence id="326">It's "40, "41, somewhere there. </sentence><sentence id="327">One thing I should also mention, the <span class="building">Jewish synagogue</span>, incidentally, they burned it. </sentence><sentence id="328">But first, they took the golden leaves off. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Who else would have been ? </sentence><sentence id="330">Did they prevent you from going into <span class="building">Polish schools</span> or ... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: There were absolutely no <span class="building">Polish schools</span> beyond the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="332">Germans considered us a race which was supposed to be eliminated after they eliminated the Jewish race. </sentence><sentence id="333">We were the number two in <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">And, therefore, they said they don't have to be educated beyond the simple reading and arithmetics. </sentence><sentence id="335">Therefore, no <span class="building">high schools</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="336">Of course, immediately the <span class="building">underground high schools</span> sprang up, and the former teachers, you know, they were meeting in groups of four, five, ten <span class="building">private homes</span> and continuing the studies. </sentence><sentence id="337"><span class="building">Universities</span>, of course, were nonexistent for Poles. </sentence><sentence id="338">In the area of <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, I was a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="339">I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="340">It took some time before I started to know who is who. </sentence><sentence id="341">I have joined, of course, first thing, the <span class="building">high school</span> -- <span class="building">underground high school</span> where I continued my studies. </sentence><sentence id="342">Out there among the boys, I found my first contact on the fighting <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: Let me change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Well, that was among these students in this <span class="building">underground high school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="358">And after a while, I was asked to join an <span class="building">underground organization</span>, fighting organization. </sentence><sentence id="359">And I was worn in; of course, I have to be certain that I was swearing the obedience to the right people and fortunately I did. </sentence><sentence id="360">Because this was the Polish government under the allies, which was at the time located in <span class="country">England</span>, in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="361">I won't say much about the <span class="building">high school</span>, but I will mention one thing. </sentence><sentence id="362">That my last year in that <span class="building">high school</span>, the principal came in to me and said, "Look, you are in endangering the group. </sentence><sentence id="363">We will give you your <span class="building">high school</span> certificate. </sentence><sentence id="364">You don't have to attend any more of the <span class="spatial object">classes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="365">We know you are engaged in the underground activities." </sentence><sentence id="366">And he did that to a couple of other boys from my group, so we basically did not finish the actual, listening to actual lectures. </sentence><sentence id="367">But we got the graduation on the merit of what we had done up to that point. </sentence><sentence id="368">And that was, of course, the second year. </sentence><sentence id="369">I was in this almost 18 months. </sentence><sentence id="370">The beginning, my beginning in -- also, general life conditions in Minsk- <span class="populated place">Suwatki</span> at that time -- in 1940 when we arrived there, I think it was late 1940. </sentence><sentence id="371">The Jews already had to wear the Star of David on the arm band, but they were not in <span class="populated place">ghettos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">They lived in their own <span class="building">homes</span> like they did before. </sentence><sentence id="373">And I think late in 1940, I remember, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was organized in <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">This was a very unique <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because no wires or no <span class="dlf">barbed wires</span> were put in. </sentence><sentence id="375">But they simply designated four main <span class="dlf">streets</span> as the boundaries of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">Of course, the order of the day was that any Jew who was found outside of that was shot on the spot, and that happened quite often. </sentence><sentence id="377">I didn't see, personally, myself the shooting, but I've seen the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="378">Something happened maybe 15 minutes I arrived at that point. </sentence><sentence id="379">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> I think was fairly loose and a lot of Jews from <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, I think managed to mingle with Poles and get away from the <span class="populated place">town</span>, according to various villagers. </sentence><sentence id="380">And farmers, of course, it depends again on the personality of the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="381">Quite for money, quite often for humanitarian reasons, they would hide and save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="382">This was very  dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever, food or sheltering, you endangered your entire family and your <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="383">It happened many, many times where a neighbor who didn't like his neighbor said, "Hey, my neighbor yesterday gave something to the Jews who came out of the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, out of the <span class="env feature">forest</span>." </sentence><sentence id="384">Well, that entire family was wiped out, and their <span class="building">house</span> was burned to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="385">And the news all around was arriving, this happened in this <span class="populated place">village</span>; this happened in that <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="386">So population, Polish population basically was very frightened and very careful on it. </sentence><sentence id="387">This probably could be the reason why it was universally practiced. </sentence><sentence id="388">On the other hand, AK, which is the underground organization to which I belonged, and that means -- AK means Army Krajowa, which is <span class="building">home army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="389">Had very specific orders to assist and help as much as possible by absorbing young Jews who were in the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and wanted to join the guerrillas, they were welcomed with open arms. </sentence><sentence id="390">As a matter of fact, here in <span class="populated place">Los Angeles</span>, we had an example of that. </sentence><sentence id="391">In my combat organization, Mr. Harter, who belongs to veteran's organization, veteran guerilla organization, was saved by Poles and survived the war by being in the guerilla unit. </sentence><sentence id="392">I heard of many, many instances of the same thing happening, but this is my personal involvement with Mr. Harter. </sentence><sentence id="393">My beginning in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> was simply what they call small sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="394">We were putting placards on <span class="dlf">streets</span>, anti-German, trying to change their morale, which at the time at the beginning, 1940, "41, was still pretty high. </sentence><sentence id="395">But we were trying to pass some messages to them by graffiti type, by placards, by all possible means that the war, the fighting is a hopeless war. </sentence><sentence id="396">They're not going to win. </sentence><sentence id="397">After a few months, I graduated from this small sabotage into the real <span class="building">fighting unit</span> where we were, for instance, protecting the parachute drops from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">We also were protecting on other occasions the <span class="building">radio station</span> which was communicating with the <span class="region">West</span>. </sentence><sentence id="399">In 1941 there were still very few actual attacks on <span class="building">German compounds</span>, but in 1942 the speed of the military involvement increased. </sentence><sentence id="400">And in that I took part, and oh, in 1942 in blowing up two <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">In 1943, <span class="spatial object">ammunition train</span>, we blew up and also took materials to support ourselves from various <span class="building">industrial complexes</span> like a <span class="building">chocolate factory</span> where we took tons and tons of sugar. </sentence><sentence id="402">We loaded them on the horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span> the peasants supplied. </sentence><sentence id="403">And then sold that for money to support the guerilla activities. </sentence><sentence id="404">Blew up a <span class="building">vodka distillery</span>, other smaller activities wherein the <span class="populated place">villages</span> -- in every <span class="populated place">village</span>, Germans said you have to deliver so many horses, so many cows, so many tons of grain or potatoes for the <span class="country">Germany</span> effort. </sentence><sentence id="405">And usually, there were designated people who were responsible for that. </sentence><sentence id="406">And those people knowing that they're working and they can be banished for it, they were very eager. </sentence><sentence id="407">We tried to dampen their enthusiasm and warn them not to do it in a too eager way. </sentence><sentence id="408">If someone like that didn't listen to us, next time we took him and publicly in that <span class="populated place">village</span>, let's say, 50 lashes. </sentence><sentence id="409">We also watched women, that they wouldn't go with German soldiers or German civilians. </sentence><sentence id="410">If that happened and she didn't get the warning and continued, a <span class="spatial object">unit</span> would go shave her head to zero and put a finger on her that she was a prostitute. </sentence><sentence id="411">Smaller other things, and usually the boys 12, 13, girls even were involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="412">In the <span class="building">movie theater</span>, there would be a German with a Polish prostitute in the mink coat. </sentence><sentence id="413">Well, they  would have the <span class="spatial object">spray bottle</span> with the strong acid, and very quietly would spray that acid on the fur coat of the girl. </sentence><sentence id="414">By the time the girl was leaving the <span class="building">movie theater</span>, the fur coat was almost falling off her back. </sentence><sentence id="415">Those were the expressions of resistance from the youngest all the way up. </sentence><sentence id="416">We tried to liberate our prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="417">We attacked several <span class="building">prisons</span> and liberated quite a few. </sentence><sentence id="418">What Germans in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, however, for every German killed, they tried to wipe out 25, 50 Poles. </sentence><sentence id="419">And what they would usually do, they would put a sign on all the visible places in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> that today or yesterday a German soldier was attacked and killed. </sentence><sentence id="420">For that 50 Poles tomorrow will be executed, although they were listed as possible people to go free. </sentence><sentence id="421">So the terror was unbelievable, but by the year 1942, "43, we realized that if we were doing nothing as we were in 1940, let's say, the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, we were dying. </sentence><sentence id="422">We were being hanged on the <span class="dlf">streets</span> for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="423">The <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> were full of Poles, not only Jews, but Poles. </sentence><sentence id="424">Of course, those Jews from <span class="country">Poland</span> were Poles anyway, so there's no distinction there. </sentence><sentence id="425">But in the Polish located <span class="populated place">camps</span>, Germans, of course, brought Jews from other <span class="country">countries</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">From that you can see what the situation was developing in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="427">So we finally decided, hey, if we have to die, we might as well die taking some of them with us, and that's where this pace of resistance accelerated. </sentence><sentence id="428">And that's where more <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went up, more <span class="dlf">bridges</span> were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="429">More attacks on the <span class="dlf">airfields</span> and other military objectives happened. </sentence><sentence id="430">By 1942, I think it's July 1942, in July 1942 out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> I think they have taken some 220 people and in one day shot them at the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span>, at the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="431">Now, I have not witnessed that, but it was universally known. </sentence><sentence id="432">On August 1942, the <span class="populated place">Minsk ghetto</span> was liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="433">What happened is the Germans, Latvians, Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police, rounded all inhabitants of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> into the <span class="building">marketplace</span>. </sentence><sentence id="434">A few thousand people were in that <span class="building">marketplace</span>, and they didn't know what is going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="435">They stayed there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="436">Some were trying to escape, and they were, of course, shot during the escape. </sentence><sentence id="437">Next day in a <span class="spatial object">column</span> -- they formed the <span class="spatial object">columns</span> and all the inhabitants of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> were marched into the <span class="building">railroad station</span> where numerous <span class="spatial object">cattle wagons</span> were waiting for them. </sentence><sentence id="438">They were loaded with the help again of Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="439">The Jewish police, although not armed, they had baseball bats, all of them, and special hats and special arm bands. </sentence><sentence id="440">During that <span class="spatial object">transport</span> and during the gathering of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in the <span class="building">marketplace</span>, the word was that about 1,000 of the Jews were shot. </sentence><sentence id="441">Where the <span class="spatial object">trains</span> went, I'm not sure whether they went to <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> or <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or some other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="442">I have witnessed the march from a <span class="dlf">window</span> on the <span class="dlf">street</span> to which they were going, I have witnessed the march of the Jews to the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>. </sentence><sentence id="443">I have not seen personally anyone killed, because the <span class="region">region</span> where I was was rather short visible from the <span class="dlf">window</span> where I was. </sentence><sentence id="444">But I could hear the shots, and then the word came in the next day and the following day among Poles that about 1,000 were shot during that incident. </sentence><sentence id="445">So this was the finish and annihilation of the <span class="populated place">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="446">There were, of course, 500 craftsmen -- tailors, shoemakers, people who were taken out of <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> before, and they were housed in the <span class="building">Copernicus (ph) School</span>, and they were working for the German Army, working on the German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="447">Working on producing shoes, doing things which  were useful for the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="448">From that group, sometimes in 1943, "42, "43, some 200 were taken and shot again in the <span class="dlf">Jewish cemetery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="449">The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army. </sentence><sentence id="450">On January 6th, which happens to be a Polish Catholic holiday, that's why I remember the date, was the annihilation of the rest of the Jews from the <span class="building">Copernicus School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="451">How did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="452">And that I personally witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="453">At that time I had the documents on my own name; however, they were documents very strong which I received from the <span class="dlf">underground channels</span>, underground help. </sentence><sentence id="454">I was a fireman in a <span class="building">factory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="455">There was a <span class="building">factory</span> in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> where several of us from the <span class="interior space">underground</span> were employed for the simple reason that those documents allowed us to be on the <span class="dlf">street</span> after the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="456">Curfew in <span class="populated place">town</span> was like 7 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock, no Jew, no Pole could be on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="457">Only Germans were allowed to be after curfew on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">So with those documents, of course, we could go on our underground activities, gather for the job to be done somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="459">That very morning on the 6th of January, we noticed shooting. </sentence><sentence id="460">And looking outside we see a lot of smoke coming out. </sentence><sentence id="461">Being, of course, a fire brigade in a <span class="building">factory</span>, our concern was supposed to be a <span class="building">factory</span>, but we decided to go and see if we can help and put the fire out in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="462">So we all put the helmets on, jumped into the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and went toward the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="463">Well, the smoke was coming in from the <span class="building">Copernicus School</span> where the remnants of the Jewish population of <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> were housed. </sentence><sentence id="464">On arrival, the entire <span class="building">building</span> was in flames. </sentence><sentence id="465">The <span class="dlf">roof</span> was on the verge of collapse. </sentence><sentence id="466">Outside one could see uniformed Latvians, Germans, Sicherheitspolizei, and Polish police shooting at the <span class="dlf">window</span> and generally trying to finish whoever was trying to get out of the fire. </sentence><sentence id="467">I could see two piles of <span class="spatial object">bodies</span> some six, seven feet high, piled up next to the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="468">I could see on the ledges of <span class="dlf">windows</span> half-burned bodies. </sentence><sentence id="469">I could a mother with a little child trying to throw the child out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> when someone shot her and killed her. </sentence><sentence id="470">The thing which stayed with me for many, many, many years after the war, however, was an incident which happened a few steps from me. </sentence><sentence id="471">A gendarme, a German six-foot plus tall, because I am six foot so I can judge the height, some 250 pounds heavy takes a little Jewish girl by the hand. </sentence><sentence id="472">Leads her to the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, sits her by that <span class="dlf">wall</span>, corrects her posture even. </sentence><sentence id="473">Moves back a few steps and shoots her right in the head. </sentence><sentence id="474">Now, at a moment like that, one is ready, of course, to jump and do something, but what could one do? </sentence><sentence id="475">I could only pay back for happenings like that through my underground activities. </sentence><sentence id="476">Because anything on the spot out there would have meant death to all of us. </sentence><sentence id="477">I did not want this to be forgotten in case they do not have in the <span class="building">museum</span> any records of what happened in Minsk- <span class="populated place">Suwatki</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">Two often one hears the Holocaust never happened. </sentence><sentence id="479">Well, here is one eyewitness who saw what was going on and what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="480">Where the Jews from <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> were taken, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="481">Whether this was <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>, whether this was <span class="populated place">Sachsenhausen</span> or <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but usually those three were the main sources of gathering the Jews from <span class="populated place">Polish ghettos</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="612">Frankly, we didn't hear much about it. </sentence><sentence id="613">Although I tell you one thing from reading after the war, we had a courier from <span class="country">Poland</span> who is still alive, still lectures. </sentence><sentence id="614">Who went from <span class="country">Poland</span> to <span class="populated place">London</span> and reported to allies and to Roosevelt and Churchill what was going on in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="615">Because Germans were trying to say nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="616">Well, so the Jewish population in the <span class="country">United States</span> through that should have known what is happening to their brothers and sisters in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="617">And yet, to my disappointment, they didn't do enough to do something about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: I was curious how and where you were at that time , </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: No, you were not aware. </sentence><sentence id="628">Your movements were so limited. </sentence><sentence id="629">You were not supposed to move from one <span class="populated place">town</span> to another <span class="populated place">town</span>, so the people who were aware that there was something going on were only the people who lived close by. </sentence><sentence id="630">In 1943, of course, as I said, the pace of the underground activities accelerated considerably, and also in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="631">The defeat of German was very apparent in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="632">One could see the things they had to do to sustain their fighting. </sentence><sentence id="633">For instance, an order would come in like winter 1943 to all the Polish women. </sentence><sentence id="634">Any fur coat you have you have to deliver to a <span class="dlf">pickup point</span>. </sentence><sentence id="635">So they picked up all the fur coats any woman had in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="636">The next few months, you could see the Germans coming out of <span class="country">Russia</span> on their <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> wearing women's fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="637">The winter was hitting them so badly in <span class="country">Russia</span>, they were not prepared for it, that they had to be in Polish ladies" fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="638"><span class="interior space">Underground</span> was prepared to the point that when the defeat of <span class="country">Germany</span> was apparent and before the Soviets moved to <span class="country">Poland</span>, liberate ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="639">There were at that time in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> some 300,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="640">When that day came in, when the Soviet troops moved on the territory of <span class="country">Poland</span> and the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising started on August 1, 1944 -- and incidentally, when I talk about <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising, I'm talking about the Polish uprising. </sentence><sentence id="641">There was a Jewish uprising in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> several months before that. </sentence><sentence id="642">It didn't last very long. </sentence><sentence id="643">Resistance was not very strong. </sentence><sentence id="644"><span class="building">Polish underground</span> tried to help by delivering to the <span class="dlf">underground channel</span> through the <span class="dlf">sewers</span> a lot of arms to the fighters in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="645">But those few who were fighting were eliminated and that was liquidated totally. </sentence><sentence id="646">End of Tape #1  1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: You know, I'm not sure whether something is -- we're starting a new tape. </sentence><sentence id="668">It might -- I wanted to learn a little bit more some of the specific risks you undertook in some of your underground activities. </sentence><sentence id="669">And I also want to ask you questions about general underground organization, but wherever you want to start. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: Well, let's first talk about the organization of <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="674">In the early days of war, that means 1939, "40, there were multitudes of organizations, underground organizations, all eager to fight Germans. </sentence><sentence id="675">They ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right. </sentence><sentence id="676">In the <span class="region">extreme right</span>, you had what probably what gave the rest of us the anti-Semitic, how you call it? </sentence><sentence id="677">The anti-Semitic, I'm fighting for a name, image. </sentence><sentence id="678">Those were the extreme right organization, <span class="building">Knesset</span>, <span class="building">Natrilova Shevis Brenner</span> (ph), where they considered that <span class="country">Poland</span> is only for Poles. </sentence><sentence id="679">They were as close to the Nazi thinking that one could go, but they were soldiers; they were fighters, and they were supported from the <span class="region">West</span> probably more than we were from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="680">Some of them when order came to consolidate all the <span class="spatial object">fighting units</span>, some of them didn't join and stayed separate, like in <span class="building">Knesset</span> (ph) . </sentence><sentence id="681">Most of the unit except the branches of <span class="building">Knesset</span> and except the Communists, Army , which were run by Stalin, by <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>, joined together. </sentence><sentence id="682">And from that <span class="building">Army Krajowa</span> emerged. </sentence><sentence id="683">Army Krajowa in 1943, "43, one could consider entire <span class="country">nation</span> in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="684">It had all kinds of functions like medical/sanitary functions all over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="685">It had <span class="interior space">underground court system</span> all over the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="686">It was run from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">There was one head man, general, who was the head man of the Armia Krajowa, but in each <span class="region">region</span> -- and <span class="country">Poland</span> was divided into several <span class="region">regions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="688">Like my <span class="region">region</span>, <span class="populated place">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, was called <span class="dlf">Varangia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="689">That's a <span class="region">region</span> between <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> and <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="690">In each one of those <span class="region">regions</span>, there were <span class="dlf">subdivisions</span> where a small <span class="populated place">village</span> would have an Ob Vood. </sentence><sentence id="691">Ob <span class="populated place">Vood</span> was still subdivided into what they call <span class="spatial object">platsuski</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="692">That was the smallest possible underground unit, <span class="building">platsuski</span>, which consisted usually of one or two platoons of the local peasant, local soldiers, who would train on weekends when they didn't work in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">They would go and train at night in the art of military fighting. </sentence><sentence id="694">There was a system of <span class="building">military schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">For instance, I am a graduate of the underground <span class="building">military officers" school</span>, which I took for several months in 1942, "43. </sentence><sentence id="696">During that period, for instance, that gives you an idea to what extent we went during those several months, there were numerous instances where we fired live ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="697">Where we spent nights and nights in <span class="env feature">woods</span> learning the survival techniques. </sentence><sentence id="698">Occasionally, on something like that there would be an action where you would blow up a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> or a <span class="spatial object">train</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="699">During the -- the aim was so well specified that in small <span class="populated place">towns</span>, the military objectives in case the uprising, they're already designated for individual units, for individual platoons. </sentence><sentence id="700">To give you an example, in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> there is a <span class="building">police headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="701">That's a <span class="building">building</span> which is three stories high. </sentence><sentence id="702">That three-story high <span class="building">building</span> has only one <span class="dlf">entrance</span>, so guards were put out there. </sentence><sentence id="703">You know, they pretty well controlled entry to it. </sentence><sentence id="704">Well, each <span class="dlf">window</span> had a <span class="interior space">balcony</span>. </sentence><sentence id="705">We had <span class="dlf">ladders</span>  2 stored for months waiting for something to happen out there where we wouldn't have to look for <span class="spatial object">ladders</span>, that the <span class="spatial object">ladders</span> were already there. </sentence><sentence id="706">We took the <span class="dlf">ladders</span> and attacked them from <span class="interior space">balcony</span>, rather than through the <span class="dlf">doors</span>. </sentence><sentence id="707">It was so well thought through, so well organized, that it's incomprehensible sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="708">Numerous -- for instance, I took part in a liberation of a prisoner who was caught by <span class="building">gestapo</span>, was tortured

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="750">And incidentally, his name is Tarchinski (ph), I remember still. </sentence><sentence id="751">And he was after being beaten, the doctors advised <span class="building">gestapo</span> that he will die if he is not taken to <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="752">So they took him to <span class="building">hospital</span> with a gendarmes or gestapo man sitting by his <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="753">Well, we went to free him in German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="754">We entered, nobody even stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="755">The man by the <span class="spatial object">bed</span> of our comrade didn't even lift himself off the <span class="spatial object">chair</span> when we entered the <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="756">Several, several actions were performed in such a fashion that either German uniforms or gestapo uniforms were worn. </sentence><sentence id="757">I was myself in <span class="building">gestapo</span> uniform two, three times on various actions. </sentence><sentence id="758">It's not universally known in the <span class="region">West</span>, but some very, very high-ranking SS officers were executed in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="759">One of them was the head of the <span class="building">gestapo</span> for the entire <span class="region">eastern region</span>. </sentence><sentence id="760">His name was General Kiichira. </sentence><sentence id="761">If I remember, he was even son-in-law of Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="762">He was executed on <span class="dlf">Warsaw street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="763">The death sentence was given to him for his activities against Poles and Jews, and he was executed. </sentence><sentence id="764">So you can see that we had the -- not only the judge, but we had also the executioners in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: First of all, how was the underground economy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: This is all entire <span class="country">nation</span> underground. </sentence><sentence id="784"><span class="building">Schooling system</span>, <span class="building">medical system</span>, <span class="building">court system</span> and then army. </sentence><sentence id="785">When the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising started on August 1, the so-called what we call code name Buja (ph), which is tempest. </sentence><sentence id="786">Tempest was declared, and out of the <span class="interior space">underground</span> some 300,000 underground people came out in various parts of <span class="country">Poland</span> and started hitting the <span class="spatial object">German units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="787">How the uprising in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> started, 5 o'clock in the afternoon -- and again, every <span class="spatial object">unit</span> had objective. </sentence><sentence id="788">This <span class="spatial object">unit</span> was taking the <span class="building">powerhouse</span>, this <span class="spatial object">unit</span> was taking <span class="building">post office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="789">Some other unit was taking the <span class="building">railroad station</span> or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="790">On 5 o'clock, August 1, 1944, <span class="dlf">windows</span> suddenly opened and any German on the <span class="dlf">street</span> was just killed from the <span class="dlf">window</span> by people like you and me. </sentence><sentence id="791"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising was ready and was supposed to last four, five days at the most. </sentence><sentence id="792">And we had enough ammunition and supplies for that. </sentence><sentence id="793">By that time it was universally assumed by all of us that there will be landings in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> and <span class="populated place">Gdansk</span> from <span class="country">England</span>, that Marines will be in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="794">The Polish forces, the <span class="building">paratroop brigades</span> that we had, will be dropped on <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="795">Instead, what they did they took and annihilated that part of <span class="building">brigade</span> in <span class="populated place">Arnheim</span>. </sentence><sentence id="796">That was incidentally, under the leadership of General Sasaboski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="797">When you look at the <span class="building">movie theater</span> "<span class="dlf">Bridge Afar</span>," Sasaboski is mentioned and the paratroopers are mentioned in it. </sentence><sentence id="798">The <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>  3 uprising lasted 62 days instead of those four, five days. </sentence><sentence id="799">And I would say that almost everybody was involved in that fighting. </sentence><sentence id="800">Civilian people were digging the <span class="dlf">trenches</span>, were putting the <span class="dlf">barricades</span> on every <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="801">Young children were used to take messages in between. </sentence><sentence id="802"><span class="interior space">Kitchens</span> were set up my housewives all over. </sentence><sentence id="803">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="804">In first days, almost entire <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="805">After those five, six days when there was no ammunition, only that ammunition we had which we took from Germans, was taken. </sentence><sentence id="806">Germans used some unusual techniques. </sentence><sentence id="807">For instance, to give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="808">Barricaded, they cannot take. </sentence><sentence id="809">Any <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> they use gets burned by the Molotov cocktails from <span class="dlf">windows</span> all over. </sentence><sentence id="810"><span class="spatial object">Tank</span> on narrow <span class="dlf">streets</span> is not a good weapon to use. </sentence><sentence id="811">But they had armor, so the people were protected out there. </sentence><sentence id="812">As long as they stayed away from the <span class="region">area</span> approaching the <span class="dlf">barricade</span>, they could fire that <span class="spatial object">cannon</span> and then machine gun at will. </sentence><sentence id="813">And we couldn't do much because all we had is the rifles and then the pistols. </sentence><sentence id="814">What they did in a couple of instances in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, they surrounded the wives, mothers and children, put them in front of the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, and moved them toward the <span class="dlf">barricades</span>. </sentence><sentence id="815">And the people behind the <span class="dlf">barricade</span> see the mother, see their sister, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="816">They know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="817">You shoot your own or you let them break your <span class="dlf">barricade</span> and make a breach into your <span class="dlf">defense line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="818">Well, you're faced with decisions like that. </sentence><sentence id="819">I won't tell you what happened in those instances, but you figure out what you would do in a case like that. </sentence><sentence id="820">They also invented, I would say, what we call the <span class="spatial object">Goliath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="821">It's a little <span class="spatial object">tank</span>, small one, maybe one meter long. </sentence><sentence id="822">And they put on it half a ton, two- or three-quarter of a ton of dynamite, and this was electrically controlled and they could direct it. </sentence><sentence id="823">Here is a <span class="building">building</span> which we're defending for two weeks, they cannot take it. </sentence><sentence id="824">They direct that right at the <span class="building">building</span> and they explode it right at the <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="825">Of course, not only this <span class="building">building</span> but <span class="building">buildings</span> around go with -- just like what you've seen here in the <span class="country">United States</span> in <span class="spatial object">car bombs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="826"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> finally fell after 62 days of furies, out of <span class="country">AK</span>, some 17,000 died. </sentence><sentence id="827">Total population loss in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was over 300,000 in 62 days. </sentence><sentence id="828">If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60,000, here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="829">In 62 days, you have over 300,000 casualties. </sentence><sentence id="830">Of course, <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> negotiated the surrender with the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="831">The German Army was pulled from the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, was pulled from wherever they could find them to just defeat <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> because that was their <span class="dlf">road</span> from <span class="country">Russia</span> to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="832">At that time in other parts of <span class="country">Poland</span> -- and incidentally, during the negotiations the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> commander negotiated with Germans that the AK guerrillas and the fighters of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> will be considered under the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="833">Up to that moment, they considered us bandits. </sentence><sentence id="834">In other words, anybody could shoot us without getting any responsibility for it, taking responsibility for it. </sentence><sentence id="835">The surrender conditions were that they all will be treated under the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="836">That means they will go to the regular <span class="populated place">prisoner of war camp</span>, and that, they lived up to that, one must say. </sentence><sentence id="837">The rest of <span class="country">Poland</span> continued fighting. </sentence><sentence id="838">The rest of <span class="country">Poland</span> continued fighting and was fighting -- Soviet troops, of course, came in through treachery by inviting the Polish officers for the joint strategy sessions, the Russians invited them and those officers never came back. </sentence><sentence id="839"> 4 They landed all in <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="840">The troops without the officers were surrounded by Soviet troops, were disarmed and forcibly forced into a Polish Army under the Soviet command, which had an obedience to a Soviet puppet government in <span class="populated place">Moscow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="841">They created a Polish government in <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> consisting of some hard-nosed Polish Communists. </sentence><sentence id="842">I found myself in that army eventually, and in that army, incidentally, that army was being organized east of <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> between <span class="populated place">Homel</span>! </sentence><sentence id="843">and <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="844">In <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, on the outskirts of <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> is <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>, and that's where my <span class="building">unit</span> was stationed, in <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>. </sentence><sentence id="845">We had out of <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> five guards, which were put into this time, not an <span class="interior space">underground</span> anymore, but a formal <span class="building">court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="846">The <span class="building">court</span> found them guilty of atrocities against the Polish and Jewish population, and they were sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="847">And the execution of the guards was performed in <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> itself. </sentence><sentence id="848">My company was assigned to put a <span class="dlf">barrier</span> between the witnesses, the hundreds and thousands even of population, and the place of execution. </sentence><sentence id="849">The place of execution was very simple, the <span class="building">gallows</span> was put up and the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came in with the open back. </sentence><sentence id="850">The guardsmen with their hands tied and their legs tied were stationed on the <span class="spatial object">beds</span> of the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">And on command, the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> moved and they simply dropped and were hanged. </sentence><sentence id="852">We only hanged four of them because one of them hanged himself in the <span class="interior space">cell</span>. </sentence><sentence id="853">In the <span class="building">unit</span>, I was a company commander as a second lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="854">That unit was training for battlefront activities, and after a few weeks, I discovered that most of the soldiers in the unit are the Polish guerrillas, AK. </sentence><sentence id="855">Officers like me who were commanding different companies, they were also <span class="country">AK</span>. </sentence><sentence id="856">Well, we got together; we got together, and we have decided that we have to organize something within this brigade, when the allies finally show up in <span class="country">Poland</span>, that we as a unit can then arrest all the Soviet officers in the unit and all the political officers in the <span class="building">unit</span> and simply fully armed cross into the <span class="region">allied side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="857">Well, after a few weeks, we accomplished that, and we had <span class="building">underground army</span> within the Soviet Army. </sentence><sentence id="858">We made contact on the commander officer of the AK for the <span class="region">Lublin region</span>, which was still operating. </sentence><sentence id="859">He was <span class="interior space">underground</span>, he was not arrested by the Russians and gave himself under his command. </sentence><sentence id="860">This is probably silly to say at this point, but I will mention it. </sentence><sentence id="861">We made a proposal to this particular head of the <span class="interior space">underground</span> for that <span class="region">region</span> that in October when there was a big parade was going to be held in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="862">And in that parade the entire Polish government formed in <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> plus Marshal Orkorsowski (ph) and some Soviet generals were supposed to on the <span class="interior space">tribune</span> receiving the parade of all the Polish troops, which were ready to go into battle. </sentence><sentence id="863">This is October/November 1944 at that time. </sentence><sentence id="864">We made a proposal that we give our soldiers live ammunition for that parade, and the moment we are in front of the tribunes, we open fire at the government and show the world that <span class="country">Poland</span> does not want what Soviets are bringing, and that that government created by Soviets in <span class="country">Poland</span> means nothing to us. </sentence><sentence id="865">We are obeying the government inland at that time which was cooperating fully with the <span class="country">United States</span>, <span class="country">England</span> and allies. </sentence><sentence id="866">Well, supposedly, the message was sent to them and came back saying, "Forget about what you're proposing because Stalin would then make out of <span class="country">Poland</span> simply a <span class="country">Soviet Republic</span> like he made it out of <span class="country">Latvia</span>, <span class="country">Lithuania</span> or <span class="country">Estonia</span>." </sentence><sentence id="867">So we promptly forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="868"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: I'm going to ask you stop at this point. </sentence><sentence id="956">When you were talking about the hanging of the guards at <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>, is this the period when you and the Soviet Army liberated <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="959">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="960">That was already four, six weeks after. </sentence><sentence id="961"><span class="populated place">Majdanek</span> was liberated I believe in July somewhere, and this was happening July, August, September; end of September somewhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: Were you part of the group that went in and liberated <span class="populated place">Majdanek</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="968">At that time I was still in the <span class="spatial object">Polish underground</span> in the area of <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="971">Q: And when you were speaking about the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> rising and how people were fighting all over the <span class="country">country</span> in the summer of "44, where were you at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: Okay, a week before the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising started, we pretty much knew that the end was nearing. </sentence><sentence id="974">Because you could see on the major <span class="dlf">highways</span> from <span class="region">east to west</span> chaos. </sentence><sentence id="975">It reminded us of 1939, where you could civilians, you could see German soldiers individually, on <span class="spatial object">bicycles</span>, on foot, on horseback, on <span class="spatial object">military vehicle</span>, <span class="spatial object">civilian cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="976">You could see that the panic was setting and that they were running from <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="977">So a week before uprising started, we went to destroy all the communications between the east and <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="978">That meant all the <span class="dlf">telephone lines</span>, all the <span class="dlf">railroad lines</span> going to <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="979">I was assigned the <span class="region">region</span> between <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> and <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and we simply blew up the <span class="dlf">rails</span>. </sentence><sentence id="980">Somebody else did the <span class="dlf">telephone poles</span> and got them down. </sentence><sentence id="981">Somebody else in the different <span class="region">regions</span> west -- I mean east of <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="982">Then we had a concentration of our entire <span class="region">area</span> ordered for a certain time and certain date. </sentence><sentence id="983">And after accomplishing our blowing up of the <span class="dlf">rails</span>, we decided to move to the concentration point. </sentence><sentence id="984">At that concentration point, there was supposed to be <span class="building">22nd Infantry Regiment</span> and <span class="building">Brigade Calvary</span> which is the <span class="building">Mazovian Calvary Brigade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="985">One of my boys said, "Well, inside of walking, how about getting a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and riding there?" </sentence><sentence id="986">Well, we decided that that was not a bad idea, and took the <span class="spatial object">fire engine</span> from the <span class="building">fire station</span> in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="987">We put our guns under the <span class="spatial object">blankets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="988">Put the helmets on, and drove out of <span class="populated place">town</span>, not directly to the <span class="dlf">concentration point</span>, but on the <span class="dlf">secondary roads</span> we stayed overnight in a <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="989">Next day, we still stayed in that <span class="populated place">village</span> because to get to concentration point, we had to cross the main <span class="dlf">highway</span>, and by that time, the front was already nearing. </sentence><sentence id="990">You could see the entire <span class="env feature">sky</span> red, you could hear the guns. </sentence><sentence id="991">You could hear the , which were the <span class="spatial object">Soviet rockets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="992">So at the -- in the evening when it was just about dark, we started moving, and we got to the main <span class="dlf">highway</span> in total darkness without lights, without anything. </sentence><sentence id="993">It seemed to be absolutely empty. </sentence><sentence id="994">We got on the major <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="995">Suddenly I see somebody striking a match, and my heart stopped. </sentence><sentence id="996">I see an <span class="spatial object">SS helmet</span>, and I see unshaven faces of several SS soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="997"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: I hate to do this, but we're out of tape. </sentence><sentence id="1024">It's a bad point to stop. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Okay, let me just do something for a second. </sentence><sentence id="1026">When we unfortunately stopped you, you saw the <span class="spatial object">SS helmets</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: Almost automatically without thinking, I hit the bell on the <span class="spatial object">fire engine</span>, and we kept going on the <span class="dlf">road</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And the Germans either because they are so disciplined, and to them it was very logical that somebody was driving -- that the <span class="spatial object">fire engine</span> was going towards the fire, didn't even think. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We passed that <span class="dlf">turnoff</span> where we were supposed to turn off and disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1034">What happened there, it was an <span class="populated place">SS Hermann Goring panzer division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Four days later when we went through the <span class="dlf">battlefield</span> out there, we could see the remnants of some of the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> who took part in that battle, mostly <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1036">On the <span class="dlf">concentration point</span>, we had some 3,000 people concentrated, which was this regiment and the <span class="building">calvary brigade</span> I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="1037">The <span class="dlf">defensive lines</span> were -- on several <span class="populated place">villages</span>, we took our <span class="dlf">defensive lines</span> and stayed on the <span class="dlf">defensive line</span> awaiting the front somehow to roll over us. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Because the <span class="dlf">front</span> was still east of us, and they were withdrawing west. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So that night I see <span class="spatial object">planes</span> very high, flying from <span class="region">west</span> to <span class="region">east</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1040">One of them burns, comes down like a <span class="spatial object">meteor</span>, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1041">The next morning, I'm going on a patrol with a group of soldiers to penetrate the <span class="env feature">woods</span> to see if anything is going out which were like few hundred yards from us. </sentence><sentence id="1042">In the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, we see movement. </sentence><sentence id="1043">We see uniforms which don't look German. </sentence><sentence id="1044">That's where Soviet paratroopers with a <span class="building">radio station</span>, they were dropped behind the <span class="dlf">German line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Well, we kind of waved at each other, the white thing. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Started talking. </sentence><sentence id="1047">From them we learned that they were parachuted behind. </sentence><sentence id="1048">We told them we are the Polish guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="1049">We also told them that -- that morning, we found incidentally from that burning <span class="spatial object">plane</span>, we found one man with half-burned parachute. </sentence><sentence id="1050">So we told them where buried the man. </sentence><sentence id="1051">On the <span class="building">radio station</span>, they passed that to their <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Their <span class="building">headquarter</span> wanted to know our strength, our location, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Well, I wasn't going to give it to them, but I gave them a guide and sent them to the <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They wanted information, <span class="building">headquarters</span> could give it to them. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Four days later, we were withdrawing -- and incidentally, our involvement at that time was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="1056">We didn't get into any major fight. </sentence><sentence id="1057">All we were doing was disarming single or two, three German soldiers running away. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So it wasn't the war I was really trained for. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Four days after that, we're passing through the <span class="region">area</span> where we met this <span class="populated place">SS Hermann Goring division</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And the burned bodies in <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> were really telling us that that big tank battle between the <span class="spatial object">Soviet tanks</span> and <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> took place there, and that the <span class="spatial object">German tanks</span> were waiting to jump on the moving Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Most of our officers, as I mentioned, were invited for a strategy session. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Never came back from that strategy session. </sentence><sentence id="1063">The next time we heard from them was <span class="populated place">Ruzyne</span> on <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Soldiers were surrounded, disarmed and put in -- we made a proposal to them. </sentence><sentence id="1065">Leave us as we are, arm us a little bit better and we go right now today with you for <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, to liberate <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Well, how naive I was as a young boy, it was all preprogrammed what would happen to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Stalin simply  7 wanted that to last until <span class="country">Germany</span> finishes <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, because he knew that all the fighters in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> were anti-Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So he wanted Hitler to wipe out the anti- Communists for him, and that's precisely what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1069">We as the faithful allies of <span class="country">America</span>, <span class="country">England</span> and the <span class="region">Western world</span>, we were really let down and left to fend for ourself. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I don't think we deserved that. </sentence><sentence id="1071">We were the most faithful friends the <span class="region">West</span> had at the time, but that's how the war sometimes ends. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Lesson from it from my own personal experience is don't let the war ever happen on you own <span class="env feature">soil</span>; fight it somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1073">You fight it in <span class="country">Vietnam</span> or some remote place, at least your mothers, your sisters are not being raped and then murdered and <span class="building">houses</span> burned. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: Okay, where we stopped, you weren't quite done. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Your second in command. </sentence><sentence id="1254">You were talking about being in <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and your second commander. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1258">A: The second in command in my unit, Lieutenant Horoshevski, as I learned later, took whatever soldiers were in the <span class="building">garrison</span> at the time and fully armed crossed into the guerrillas who were operating still in that <span class="region">region</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1259">They knew that there was something going on in this <span class="building">unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1260">So on account of their being smart, advised I guess to take all the soldiers remaining in the <span class="building">brigade</span> and spread them throughout the Polish Army. </sentence><sentence id="1261">So they took four, five, maybe ten soldiers, put them in this regiment; another 10, 20 in some other regiment. </sentence><sentence id="1262">That way the entire <span class="building">brigade</span> in which I was disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1263">So I landed in the <span class="building">Rakayetska Prison</span>, which was the <span class="building">prison</span> which held mostly the former AK accused of -- well, being AK was enough to go to <span class="building">jail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1264">They were calling us at that time "spit-on midgets of reactionary forces." </sentence><sentence id="1265">That's how they called, Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1266">In that <span class="building">prison</span> a lot of executions took place. </sentence><sentence id="1267">By that time there were  9 no Jews there anymore, strictly Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1268">There was a <span class="interior space">cell</span> where they were torturing people. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And we knew that because next to the <span class="interior space">cells</span>, they kept always the, what do you call, you carry the wounded on them. </sentence><sentence id="1270"><span class="spatial object">Stretcher</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1271">There was always <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span> and we could kind of peek and see that on a <span class="spatial object">stretcher</span>, they were taking a body at night out. </sentence><sentence id="1272">The <span class="interior space">cell</span> in which we were was very small, and there were some 13 of us. </sentence><sentence id="1273">One slept on the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and actually to turn around, it had to be on command. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Everybody had to turn because there was not enough <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1275">For urination and physical discharge, there was <span class="spatial object">barrel</span> kept inside, just covered. </sentence><sentence id="1276">So the smell was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1277">After that <span class="building">prison</span>, I was arrested in June -- I mean in March 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1278">In July of 1945, I was half blind. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Partial blindness from the lack of vitamins, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I lost some 60 pounds during that period of time, and I peeked through the <span class="dlf">window</span> and I see horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1281">But all I could see is maybe left leg of the horse and the right ear and maybe a head of the peasant who was running it. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I couldn't see the full picture. </sentence><sentence id="1283">One night in July, suddenly something unusual happened. </sentence><sentence id="1284">They taking us for a <span class="interior space">shower</span> and they shaved us totally to the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I mean head and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Well, the word went they taking us probably to <span class="country">Russia</span>, <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1287">They don't want Polish insects out there in <span class="country">Russia</span>, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1288">They have enough of their own. </sentence><sentence id="1289">They washed us and the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, several <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came in on the property of the <span class="building">prison</span> inside. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And they started loading people into the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1291">We didn't know what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I suddenly looked and I see in one of the loys (ph) my company chief, Sergeant Shuper (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1293">He just happened, just happened by miracle that the group of soldiers when they disbanded the <span class="building">brigade</span> was put in the unit which was ordered to transport us somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Now, <span class="populated place">Shuper</span> recognized me immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Put his finger on his lips, and then when the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> started moving, he jumped into the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> with me. </sentence><sentence id="1296">That's when I learned that Horoshevski took the rest of our soldiers who were at the time in the <span class="building">barracks</span> and took them into the German guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="1297">That's where I learned that the <span class="building">brigade</span> was disbanded and Shuper is telling me that "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1298">When you ask to be taken to urinate out of the <span class="spatial object">railroad car</span>, just run. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And the guard will shoot above your head, so you don't have to worry." </sentence><sentence id="1300">And I told him, "No, either all of us or none." " </sentence><sentence id="1301">You will be going to a <span class="region">territory</span> where the guerrillas still operate, and I want you in every stop we make to pass the word that the AK prisoners are being transported to <span class="country">Russia</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1302">And, of course, wherever we stopped -- and we stopped many times because the Soviet war was still on. </sentence><sentence id="1303">The Soviet troops -- no, the war over in May, but <span class="spatial object">trains</span> east/west with the military equipment and troops were having the priority. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So we were stopped quite a few times. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We were singing the songs of the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising, the patriotic songs. </sentence><sentence id="1306">People ... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1698">A: Well, secrecy how it worked, you had to keep the secrecy, and that's why to start with, you only knew four people besides you. </sentence><sentence id="1699">The groups were five, five, five. </sentence><sentence id="1700">So if anything happened, only five -- might be a thousand, only five would diminish because you didn't know anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1701">There were not very many traitors in <span class="country">Poland</span>, not very many. </sentence><sentence id="1702">And if they were, they were properly dealt with. </sentence><sentence id="1703">Went into <span class="interior space">underground court</span>, executed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1712">A: Without support of population, you cannot fight a guerilla war. </sentence><sentence id="1713">You have to have a population on your side. </sentence><sentence id="1714">The population, of course, in <span class="country">Poland</span> was frightened, was beaten to the pulp sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1715">You had to do some convincing occasionally so that they would help you. </sentence><sentence id="1716">For instance, we had some problems with getting horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span> to move from one <span class="region">area</span> to another <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Either wounded or <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> or even go in a quick action where you wanted to be faster than just walking. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Some farmers, you know, we approached. </sentence><sentence id="1719">They said, oh, they would do anything not to do  5 it. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Eventually, I think we took care of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1732">A: Well, you basically didn't trust anyone in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1733">You really didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="1734">So you had to have either someone from your <span class="spatial object">unit</span> with whom you were for a long time or be on your alert with any newcomers you met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1738">Q: You were constantly on alert? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1742">Q: Now, just in terms of sort of the logistics, of the difficulties in terms of getting -- how you got food, how you got information, how you got supplies, how you got directions, how did this work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1744">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1745">First of all, the communications. </sentence><sentence id="1746">Girls, young Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts were used for that. </sentence><sentence id="1747">They carried the messages between the <span class="populated place">towns</span> and the commanders of the units. </sentence><sentence id="1748">Usually the messages were coded. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Couldn't use the <span class="building">radio stations</span> because Germans had very good equipment to detect. </sentence><sentence id="1750">As a matter of fact, in the early days we had a special <span class="spatial object">unit</span> which was protecting the <span class="building">radio station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1751">That the <span class="spatial object">unit</span> got into clash several times, and we abandoned that and instead, we had three, four people unit moving the <span class="building">radio stations</span> as many times as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1752">As far as logistics, food, we tried as many times as we could to sleep in <span class="populated place">villages</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1753">We had permanent <span class="interior space">quarters</span> in <span class="env feature">forests</span>, deep in <span class="env feature">forests</span>, but in my <span class="region">area</span> the actions requested from us were such that they were in the different <span class="region">region</span> of the <span class="region">region</span> we operated. </sentence><sentence id="1754">So quite often, you know, after one action, you had to almost the same night jump some 30 miles away somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So to do things like that, you had to have friendly villagers. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And most of them were friendly. </sentence><sentence id="1757">A few <span class="populated place">villages</span> were burned because of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1772">Q: By your people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1774">A: No, by Germans, because somebody said hey, maybe that's where they -- the partisans, as you call it. </sentence><sentence id="1775">The Germans came in, get confirmation from somebody on that from somebody in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and this entire <span class="populated place">village</span> was wiped out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1778">Q: Did your people have to resort to violent tactics to get food ever? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1780">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Now, we, of course, had other sources besides being fed my villagers. </sentence><sentence id="1782">Some of our actions were not of purely military nature, they were of kind of commercial industrial nature. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Like taking, you know, thousands of liters of vodka or a hundred tons of sugar or the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> of socks we took in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And that was a very interesting one because it was in the middle of the German Army almost. </sentence><sentence id="1785"> 6 On one <span class="dlf">rail</span>, there was a <span class="spatial object">military transport</span> standing. </sentence><sentence id="1786">The other <span class="dlf">rails</span> were occupied by the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> which had the socks, army socks. </sentence><sentence id="1787">An entire <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1788">And there was a guard there. </sentence><sentence id="1789">We came in and we managed to disarm that guard without harming him at all. </sentence><sentence id="1790">Just took the bullets out of his gun, let him have the gun, and we told him, "You just keep walking the way you were walking before." </sentence><sentence id="1791">And we were simply loading and unloading from the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> into the horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1792">And one <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> after another full of socks went in next to a <span class="spatial object">military train</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1806">Q: Why were socks important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1808">A: Oh, you needed a lot of socks in partisans, in guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="1809">But you could also sell socks. </sentence><sentence id="1810">When you sold them, you had money for food. </sentence><sentence id="1811">We also had parachute drops from <span class="country">England</span> and from <span class="country">Italy</span>, because at that time allies were already in <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1812">As a matter of fact, <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> during the uprising for some 40 days didn't get any assistance from anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1813">When <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was already failing -- the insurrection was failing, we got some supplies from <span class="country">Italy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1814">The U.S. Air Force flew one sortie of supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1815">And we, as a matter of fact, had American flyers whom we could identify decorated 50 years after <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1824">Q: Were there women fighting with you in the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1826">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1827">Women were mostly -- although they were not the fighting unit, but they were in the <span class="building">Red Cross Corps</span> but with the partisans, with the guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="1828">They were in communications. </sentence><sentence id="1829">All kinds of axillary situations. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1836">A: Not many, but there were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1838">Q: They had their own organizations as well, didn't they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1840">A: That, I never come across anyone like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1842">Q: Now, the question about when you were in the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, that you had a conventional job and you were back in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1854">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Jews in <span class="populated place">Minsk</span> at that time was -- they were <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and the craftsmen were in the <span class="building">Copernicus School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1856">In that <span class="building">factory</span>, it was maintaining the <span class="spatial object">German cars</span> coming from the <span class="region">eastern front</span>, and that was a hell of a good supply for us of arms. </sentence><sentence id="1857">Because behind the back <span class="spatial object">seats</span>, when you looked carefully there you found all kinds of treasures. </sentence><sentence id="1858">The driver might have been dead. </sentence><sentence id="1859">He might have forgotten what he put out there. </sentence><sentence id="1860">But they had a lot of French slave labor there, and they were left leaning, Communist leaning. </sentence><sentence id="1861">But we talked with them, and they were tipping us off to some things, no question about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1870">Q: Was there sabotage in that <span class="building">factory</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1872">A: There wasn't much to sabotage out there because those were maintenance of <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, and what can you sabotage there? </sentence><sentence id="1873">There were other more important things to sabotage and they all were. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I took part, for instance, in burning the <span class="building">supply depots</span>, and in that we almost had a disaster. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Because the engineer set up the <span class="spatial object">carnotite</span> bombs to fire at two hours, and somebody switched it to 20 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And as I was cutting the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> to get -- to enter into the <span class="building">supply depot</span>, I see sparks coming out of the <span class="spatial object">pocket</span>, side pocket of a man next to me. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And he managed to take that off and throw out, but got burned on his face, all over his body. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And <span class="spatial object">carnotite</span> is a terrific, 3,000 Fahrenheit temperature. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1886">Q: We need to change the tape. </sentence><sentence id="1887">You were getting into specifics about what was involved in your close call, the sabotage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: Well, for instance, this particular one I was describing, the incident with a <span class="spatial object">carnotite bomb</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1891">We were supposed to put it on the <span class="dlf">roofs</span> of <span class="building">barracks</span> where they were storing a lot of things, military supplies to go into the <span class="region">eastern front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1892">Because of this carnotite incident, the action didn't work the way it was supposed to and we had to run. </sentence><sentence id="1893">We had to run under fire because next to it was again German and Continental Guards. </sentence><sentence id="1894">But not knowing what the problem with that thing is, I took my <span class="spatial object">carnotite</span> and since there was almost a <span class="env feature">mountain</span> of the insulating material, like shavings from the wood, I took that and threw it in that direction. </sentence><sentence id="1895">Threw it in that direction and got rid of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1902">Q: Can we stop for a moment? </sentence><sentence id="1903">All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
