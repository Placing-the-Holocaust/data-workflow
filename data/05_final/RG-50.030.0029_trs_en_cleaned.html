and that was a very, very hot day. </sentence><sentence id="379">I had ninety degrees. </sentence><sentence id="380">And he commanded us to "make sport"--that was express what they used. </sentence><sentence id="381">Run, lie down. </sentence><sentence id="382">Up, run, up, run...and so on. </sentence><sentence id="383">He did it with us one hour long, the whole so-called lunch time. </sentence><sentence id="384">Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that when we finished. </sentence><sentence id="385">So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the evening to the so-called "Revier"--Krankenbau [NB: the "<span class="dlf">sick bay</span>"]. </sentence><sentence id="386">So when I came there, I saw the <span class="building">Krankenbau</span> is nearly empty. </sentence><sentence id="387">And a friend of mine who was working there said, "The <span class="building">Krankenbau</span> was taken to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span> yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="388">You have a few days time. </sentence><sentence id="389">You can rest here." </sentence><sentence id="390">So I had been there about five or six days. </sentence><sentence id="391">The <span class="building">Krankenbau</span> filled up, so the danger came always closer. </sentence><sentence id="392">I decided to tell him, "Listen, check me out from here." </sentence><sentence id="393">What he did; and really the next day the whole <span class="building">Krankenbau</span> went to the <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">Again a brush with death. </sentence><sentence id="395">So I came uh out, back to the <span class="building">work force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="396">How you say it? </sentence><sentence id="397">And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to the <span class="building">Kanada</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">So I started again and going out for manual work. </sentence><sentence id="399">And then...just a moment, I remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that what they made the sport. </sentence><sentence id="400">I had a friend in uh...in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span> who was a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="401">And I had one of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out. </sentence><sentence id="402">So I wanted to uh show my appreciation for it. </sentence><sentence id="403">So I brought him a little bit of a...of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB: tobacco] what I found in the Kanada. </sentence><sentence id="404">And on the way back, they let us...undressed us, naked, and they found the cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="405">And for that I got a two month...two months in the <span class="building">Straf company</span> [NB: Strafkommando = "punishment brigade"]. </sentence><sentence id="406">The <span class="building">Straf company</span> is  the...everybody knows what a <span class="building">straf company</span>...company is. </sentence><sentence id="407">So it was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="408">When we work, our work was there. </sentence><sentence id="409">We was digging uh a <span class="dlf">channel</span> to...to let off the <span class="env feature">water</span>; because that was <span class="region">swamp area</span>, a canalization. </sentence><sentence id="410">And we was digging it to the...down to the <span class="dlf">banks</span> of the <span class="dlf">Vistula</span>, that it shouldn't be the...the <span class="env feature">terrain</span> should be dry, the possibility to dry out. </sentence><sentence id="411">I was working up "til here in <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me out; because by myself, between the <span class="spatial object">cane</span> what was going there, I would never came out by myself. </sentence><sentence id="413">Only with help. </sentence><sentence id="414">I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for some reason not in two months [but] after six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="415">So I came out. </sentence><sentence id="416">So I turned to a few friends for help. </sentence><sentence id="417">So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit something to eat, something else. </sentence><sentence id="418">And naturally that was the time when we came back to workforce. </sentence><sentence id="419">Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know. </sentence><sentence id="420">So I started to work; and again thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least part Schreiber [Trans: "scribe"]. </sentence><sentence id="421">And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I worked in one small <span class="building">Kommando</span> as Schreiber. </sentence><sentence id="422">In the afternoon, again I worked two hours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work. </sentence><sentence id="423">So that...what I made my life a little bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup extra from the kapo of that <span class="building">Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh got a position in the <span class="building">Kanada Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="425">He some...somehow was uh promoted there. </sentence><sentence id="426">And I go...go to...went to him, and told him, "Listen." </sentence><sentence id="427">Uh, Carl was his name. " </sentence><sentence id="428">Say, Carl, can you do something for me? </sentence><sentence id="429">Look how I am. </sentence><sentence id="430">Look how I look. </sentence><sentence id="431">I would need a little bit to recover. </sentence><sentence id="432">Take me back to the <span class="building">Kommando</span>." " </sentence><sentence id="433">Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are coming tomorrow to the <span class="building">Kommando</span>." </sentence><sentence id="434">So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some jealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back. </sentence><sentence id="435">So say the...the...the Haftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him. </sentence><sentence id="436">That mean, I was stealing goods from the <span class="building">Kommando</span> and carrying it for him. </sentence><sentence id="437">It wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="438">The only thing what I ever "organized"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized only food. </sentence><sentence id="439">For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="440">I could share with them. </sentence><sentence id="441">So it went so far that they started to uh work against me. </sentence><sentence id="442">"Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, "When you are coming tomorrow morning to work, you are not going <span class="building">home</span>." </sentence><sentence id="443">So naturally I didn't came. </sentence><sentence id="444">This time a new <span class="building">Kommando</span> started to...came in existence. </sentence><sentence id="445">Our job was to dismantle <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> which has been shot up around that <span class="region">area</span>, regardless German, English, American. </sentence><sentence id="446">And I befriended myself with that <span class="spatial object">kapo</span>. </sentence><sentence id="447">I knew him from before. </sentence><sentence id="448">We worked always...already sometime together. </sentence><sentence id="449">He knew about my knowledge of the German language. </sentence><sentence id="450">So I started there as a Schreiber. </sentence><sentence id="451">We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it was built up to about thirteen hundred. </sentence><sentence id="452">So the responsibility was quite big, because we had to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the <span class="building">Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="453">In one case, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="454">I don't know if they succeeded or...or not. </sentence><sentence id="455">But the fact was they didn't came in to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="456">Big excitement. </sentence><sentence id="457">"Schreiber from [<span class="populated place">zelligbatterie</span> (ph)], nach voraus!"--"To the front to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="458">Give me the numbers uh from these two men who are missing." </sentence><sentence id="459">I didn't have that on me. </sentence><sentence id="460">I turned around to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the piece of paper where the two numbers have been written down. </sentence><sentence id="461">Because that what  happens in the morning before we went out. </sentence><sentence id="462">Every group of twenty had to be...uh their...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="463">And they had to be compared during the day, if he was yesterday in at <span class="building">work</span> or not. </sentence><sentence id="464">So a lot of uh unnecessary scribbling. </sentence><sentence id="465">But he...so he came. </sentence><sentence id="466">He gave up that piece of paper to the <span class="building">SS</span> in the front. </sentence><sentence id="467">They look at that are the numbers. " </sentence><sentence id="468">Hor auf!" </sentence><sentence id="469">That mean, "Disappear!" </sentence><sentence id="470">So we went back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right. </sentence><sentence id="471">If I couldn't have produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me. </sentence><sentence id="472">So I just want to mention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have been there everyday. </sentence><sentence id="473">Every moment was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="474">Having a assistant this time, the new <span class="spatial object">transport</span> arrived on the same uh <span class="dlf">track</span> where we got the <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> where we unloaded the remnantses [sic] and the raw material from the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="475">The aluminum and every usable part was uh sorted out. </sentence><sentence id="476">The old aluminum what went in the <span class="building">mills</span> or in the <span class="building">factories</span>, that was recycled. </sentence><sentence id="477">So...and sometime on the same <span class="dlf">track</span> came new <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="478">And in <span class="building">the Kanada</span>, they had the duty...when a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> came, they had been on the <span class="dlf">ramp</span>; and when they threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> which took them to the working place of the Kanada. </sentence><sentence id="479">But they been quite experienced already to sneak out where is something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="480">So one of my friend--his name was [Juri (ph)] Fried. </sentence><sentence id="481">I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in <span class="country">Israel</span> now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he exists. </sentence><sentence id="482">So he...I have to mention that on the end of this place where the newcomers has to disembark from the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was a little <span class="building">hut</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">I went there when I saw from afar that the <span class="spatial object">transport</span> is coming. </sentence><sentence id="484">So I went there, hide myself in the <span class="building">hut</span>; and [Juri (ph)] Fried came with...always with bags full of food. </sentence><sentence id="485">I was staying there and waiting "til everything was over with, "til the <span class="dlf">ramp</span> was empty. </sentence><sentence id="486">So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the main <span class="building">Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="487">And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest. </sentence><sentence id="488">I called up all the Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="489">I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had two <span class="spatial object">kapos</span>. </sentence><sentence id="490">I called them up and told them, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="491">I want your sticks what you are using to beating the people." </sentence><sentence id="492">Very big surprise. " </sentence><sentence id="493">What is this?" " </sentence><sentence id="494">You are getting from me food for it. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the <span class="env feature">bushes</span> here in your hand. </sentence><sentence id="496">But the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let cook for you something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="497">I have the raw material." </sentence><sentence id="498">So that was one of my biggest deeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. " </sentence><sentence id="499">Specially I didn't know everybody personally. </sentence><sentence id="500">But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits through a day, that was already something. </sentence><sentence id="501">So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the beating let up. </sentence><sentence id="502">Screaming, yes. </sentence><sentence id="503">Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="504">So then one day in August 19 uh...44, we been on the march <span class="building">home</span> uh from the.... We worked on Sundays too. </sentence><sentence id="505">Coming uh <span class="building">home</span>, coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds that they should be at the long march. </sentence><sentence id="506">We had about nearly four kilometer march, and thirteen hundred people are walking tired. </sentence><sentence id="507">They are not walking like soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="508">So in front of the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite the <span class="dlf">Lager C</span> where my wife used to be this time. </sentence><sentence id="509">And I stopped there, without looking back what is going on behind my back. </sentence><sentence id="510">Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls standing there around. </sentence><sentence id="511">I didn't know how they came there, what they did there. </sentence><sentence id="512">And  during the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front of the <span class="populated place">camp</span> in a wooden <span class="building">barrack</span>, he called my wife in. " </sentence><sentence id="513">Come here." </sentence><sentence id="514">She went there. </sentence><sentence id="515">She made the procedure that uh how she had to report. </sentence><sentence id="516">And that...and he was drunk. </sentence><sentence id="517">He hardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing. </sentence><sentence id="518">And asked her, "Do you have a boyfriend?" </sentence><sentence id="519">She was surprised about that question, and said, "No, I haven't got one." </sentence><sentence id="520">And he asked, "Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="521">Because nobody wants me," she said to him. </sentence><sentence id="522">And he said, "I will take care that somebody should want you. </sentence><sentence id="523">The first man who is passing here by, they had to want...have to want you." </sentence><sentence id="524">So the first one who came by was myself. </sentence><sentence id="525">So he told me, "Talk to her!" </sentence><sentence id="526">So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a girl from <span class="country">Slovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="527">And uh, naturally, I ask, "What is your name? </sentence><sentence id="528">What...where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="529">And about one or two such trivial questions. </sentence><sentence id="530">When she said, "I can't talk like this..." To the SS man. " </sentence><sentence id="531">I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="532">And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do." </sentence><sentence id="533">And he said, "Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="534">You are...you are right." </sentence><sentence id="535">He called me. " </sentence><sentence id="536">Come here!" </sentence><sentence id="537">I told him, "Yes, what you want?" </sentence><sentence id="538">He said, "Tomorrow morning you are reporting here. </sentence><sentence id="539">And you have to come to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>." </sentence><sentence id="540">And to her, she [NB: he] said, "You will be here in the morning, and you will stay here in the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="541">And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book." </sentence><sentence id="542">Because everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact and clear. </sentence><sentence id="543">So with that episode finished in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="544">So I, I did my job further; and I joined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="545">So straight away, when I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian, he just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good friendship. </sentence><sentence id="546">So I went to him. </sentence><sentence id="547">He was one of the maintenance men in the <span class="populated place">camp,</span> and one of the few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different <span class="populated place">camps</span>, when if something was broken down he was the man who had to repair it. </sentence><sentence id="548">He was working there as a engineer. </sentence><sentence id="549">They call in English "engineer," but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]-- he was a fitter, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="550">So he...I knew that he went quite often in the <span class="populated place">womans camps</span>, too; and I knew that he knows Magda. </sentence><sentence id="551">So I went straight to him and asked him, "Listen, Erich. </sentence><sentence id="552">What is your opinion about Magda? </sentence><sentence id="553">Do you know her?" " </sentence><sentence id="554">Yes, I know her very well." " </sentence><sentence id="555">And what is your opinion?" </sentence><sentence id="556">He said, "I will tell it to you in one sentence. ( </sentence><sentence id="557">Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> who manage to be still human." </sentence><sentence id="558">I mean, I couldn't ask for a better information. </sentence><sentence id="559">So I started to run around; I organized again a...a bottle of schnapps. </sentence><sentence id="560">Because that was definitely the best uh currency between <span class="building">SS</span> and <span class="populated place">Haftlings</span> what you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="561">Better than today the American dollar or the Fren...or the Japanese yen. </sentence><sentence id="562">So I got it through my connections. </sentence><sentence id="563">The next day in the morning, really, I went in. </sentence><sentence id="564">When I came to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, I took out from under my arm where I have hidden the <span class="spatial object">bottle</span>, put it on the <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="565">And really Magda was there. </sentence><sentence id="566">She write down my name. </sentence><sentence id="567">I mean, we didn't have names. </sentence><sentence id="568">Uh, my number; and uh so I could go in. </sentence><sentence id="569">She was very uh embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="570">She...because she wasn't expecting that I will come. </sentence><sentence id="571">But for curiosity, I wanted to find out what is going on, wanted from her certain in...information. </sentence><sentence id="572">So we went in. </sentence><sentence id="573">She was running away, hiding somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="574">After few uh time...because in after short time, we met. </sentence><sentence id="575">We had uh the opportunity to talk a few words. </sentence><sentence id="576">So when I uh came in her <span class="interior space">room</span>, because as in her  functions she had the right to have a small <span class="interior space">room</span> which was about two by four meter big. </sentence><sentence id="577">That her own...she had her own <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="578">And when...when I saw her belongings, the few belongings what she had. </sentence><sentence id="579">So she reminded me somehow of my wife. </sentence><sentence id="580">And later on she was uh still very uh embarrassed, and a little bit out of shape; so she turns, she had a small <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> there hanging on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="581">She went there and started with her fingers to arrange her hair. </sentence><sentence id="582">When I told her, "Listen, it is quite a few years that I saw a woman standing in front of a <span class="spatial object">mirror</span> and getting, combing on her hair." </sentence><sentence id="583">And that somehow touched her, too. </sentence><sentence id="584">I was very touched, and she was very touched. </sentence><sentence id="585">And that somehow brought us close. </sentence><sentence id="586">Closer. </sentence><sentence id="587">And in the next few weeks, now and then I asked permission from my Oberkapo that he let me one or a few times to go and visit her. </sentence><sentence id="588">Just harmless talk, because everything else was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="589">And it was because the fact was, I didn't want to be somehow too much uh interested; because when you are not uh.... I don't know how you said that. </sentence><sentence id="590"><span class="dlf">Fallstrick</span> [Trans: pitfall, <span class="dlf">trap</span>]. </sentence><sentence id="591">When you are not careful enough, it can can bring you in trouble; and that is what we... nobody needed. </sentence><sentence id="592">So the whole relationship, all the time what we went in, was absolute platonic. </sentence><sentence id="593">So the time went by. </sentence><sentence id="594">I saw her about five or six times. </sentence><sentence id="595">And I started to like her; because I saw what she's doing, how's she's doing, how.... And I knew her reputation in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="596">Because everybody knew all about her, everybody in the <span class="populated place">men's camp</span> knew about her and knew about her deeds--what she is doing and how she is doing. </sentence><sentence id="597">She had a wonderful reputation in the...in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">And naturally I was very much impressed with that. </sentence><sentence id="599">And later on, end of November or so, "44, some difficulties started on in my <span class="building">Kommando</span>. </sentence><sentence id="600">I had that...I was already one and a half years there. </sentence><sentence id="601">So she arranged somehow that I could join to a small <span class="building">Kommando</span> which came regularly every day to her <span class="populated place">camp</span> to do some maintenance work. </sentence><sentence id="602">There was a small <span class="building">magazine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">There been a small, uh a few old <span class="spatial object">sewing machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="604">It was our duty to clean them and bring them to shape. </sentence><sentence id="605">But we always was talking and never did real, some real work. </sentence><sentence id="606">So then came the 18th of January [1945]. </sentence><sentence id="607">The 18th of January was the day when the death march from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> started. </sentence><sentence id="608">So we, we...uh we marched late afternoon from <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="609">We was taken over to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="610">I tried to hide there, to stay there what maybe I hoped. </sentence><sentence id="611">But then the rumors went around [that] the whole <span class="populated place">camp</span> is undermined, that there exist a plan that <span class="populated place">camps</span> uh will be bombarded from all sides with artillery and with the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, to make it to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="612">And...but still I went up in one of the <span class="dlf">blocks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="613">I was very tired; because the whole day, we...the stress. </sentence><sentence id="614">We had to "antrehen, abtreten, antreten, abtreten" [report, get dismissed, report, get dismissed] about five or six times during the day. </sentence><sentence id="615">So I went in one of the <span class="dlf">blocks</span> which was already empty. </sentence><sentence id="616">I hide...I hid myself under...in one of the <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, and I fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="617">Around midnight, all of a sudden I am woken up from the absolute quietness what was in the la...what was it in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="618">And I was very curious what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="619">So I went down, opened the <span class="dlf">gate</span>; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in <span class="populated place">Kanada</span> passed by. </sentence><sentence id="620">They saw me. </sentence><sentence id="621">They say, "What you are doing here?" " </sentence><sentence id="622">I want to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="623">I don't want to...I have enough. </sentence><sentence id="624">I tried...."
