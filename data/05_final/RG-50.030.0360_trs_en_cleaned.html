<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: And my date of birth, I was born on May 10th, 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Now, tell me about . </sentence><sentence id="18"> about oh, the wonderful things my mother made because I tried to do the same. </sentence><sentence id="19">I learned, in fact, from memory to do almost all the things that my mother made. </sentence><sentence id="20">There were two or three things I couldn't remember how to do, but I -- in the tape that I did for children, I described in detail all the different menus that we had for our dinners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="25">On Saturday, we were not allowed -- after sundown, we were not allowed to put the lights on in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">So everything was -- you know, had to, the sabbath had be observed very carefully. </sentence><sentence id="27">On Saturday morning we went to <span class="building">synagogue</span> again. </sentence><sentence id="28">We had to be dressed very carefully with special clothes for Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="29">We went to the <span class="building">synagogue</span> with my father, and then after the <span class="building">synagogue</span> we came <span class="building">home</span> and ate whatever my mother had to prepare the day before. </sentence><sentence id="30">Because, as I said, we couldn't cook or put the lights on on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="31">And then after our meal, we went for a walk with our father. </sentence><sentence id="32">We went to visit the different families, Jewish families, in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">And we walked up and down the <span class="populated place">village</span>, visiting everybody and in the evening we came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">Oh, by the way, when -- the first <span class="building">house</span> in which we lived behind my grandfather's <span class="building">house</span>, we had no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="35">We lived in a very, very tiny little <span class="building">house</span>, actually. </sentence><sentence id="36">It had a one-room <span class="interior space">living room</span> and one <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>, and a very small <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="37">And we had a maid, and I'll tell you how our maid lived. </sentence><sentence id="38">She lived in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">We had a <span class="spatial object">kitchen table</span> which was like a <span class="spatial object">box</span>, and in the evening, the <span class="spatial object">kitchen table</span> -- the top was removed and the <span class="spatial object">box</span> was pulled apart and that was a <span class="spatial object">bed</span> in which our maid slept. </sentence><sentence id="40">And as my father worked himself up and became better well-to-do, better to do, he built a bigger <span class="building">house</span>, which was completed in 1938, I think. </sentence><sentence id="41">We just lived there about a year before we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="42">And, of course, that <span class="building">house</span> was large, consisted of three different <span class="spatial object">units</span> and then we had a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> and electricity. </sentence><sentence id="43">But in the <span class="building">house</span> before that, we did not. </sentence><sentence id="44">The reason I mentioned that is because I said that Saturday after our walks when we walked with our father, when we came <span class="building">home</span> in the afternoon, we would sit in the <span class="interior space">living room</span> and tell stories and talk and really enjoy each other's company. </sentence><sentence id="45">And I love those evenings because it was getting dark, and I loved it when it was getting dark. </sentence><sentence id="46">And we couldn't put the light on until after the sabbath was over, and then the gas lamp was lit. </sentence><sentence id="47">But it was a very, very cozy lovely life as far as the children were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="48">Because my mother worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="49">She had to get up every morning at 6 o'clock in the morning to light the <span class="spatial object">stove</span> so that she could put on the <span class="spatial object">kettle</span> for the coffee and tea, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="50">We had a <span class="building">baker</span> next <span class="dlf">door</span>, and every morning they would deliver fresh rolls. </sentence><sentence id="51">Otherwise, my mother did all the -- everything that was done. </sentence><sentence id="52">Nothing was bought from a <span class="building">store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="53">That means noodles were made at <span class="building">home</span>, and bread was baked, actually, not at <span class="building">home</span>, but made and carried over to the baker to be baked. </sentence><sentence id="54">And then we had these huge loaves of bread that were brought <span class="building">home</span> and they lasted a week. </sentence><sentence id="55">And then my mother made the Friday or Saturday, and everything, in fact, she had to do  <span class="env feature">forest</span> and it was big snow drops, which I adored. </sentence><sentence id="56">Because the snow drops came out even while the snow was still on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">Then we looked forward to the spring because we could pick, as I said earlier, wild flowers and wild strawberries, and then -- well, we had a cow. </sentence><sentence id="58">We had chickens. </sentence><sentence id="59">And I loved all these things, everything was so great, you know. </sentence><sentence id="60">My job was to catch the chickens to make -- to see whether they are going to have an egg to lay. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I did by inserting my little finger into the rear to see whether the egg was there, because I had to lock up the chickens if they were about to lay an egg so that they wouldn't lay them just anywhere, but in a <span class="spatial object">coop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">And so I -- and then we would ride with my father in his <span class="spatial object">car</span> to the other <span class="populated place">villages</span> because he went there on business, and it was a <span class="spatial object">convertible</span> and we would sit in the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="63">And all the children would gather around us and try to toot the horn because they hadn't seen a <span class="spatial object">car</span> like that. </sentence><sentence id="64">And we would be so thrilled to be going out with him to do these things. </sentence><sentence id="65">Well, such a very lovely life, and we traveled in the summertime. </sentence><sentence id="66">We would travel to visit my uncle, my mother's younger brother, who lived in the <span class="populated place">Trnava</span> (ph), which was a <span class="building">spa</span> in <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, a very well-known <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">And he was director of the <span class="building">spa</span>. </sentence><sentence id="68">He was actually the one who saved us in the end because he was -- shall I go back . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Well, tell us about your uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Because -- now, I'm just going to give you the life in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="116">So in summertime, we would visit our uncle in , and in the wintertime, of course,  sweaters and my mother, everything was so -- it seemed so beautiful to me when I look back at it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="117">I mean, nobody does things like we had at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">And we had my mother's linen was put away -- I mean the way they wash laundry, there was no hot water. </sentence><sentence id="119">I mean, I remember that they had to take the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> to the <span class="env feature">river</span> to rinse it. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the way we had to take a <span class="interior space">bath</span> when we were little, you know. </sentence><sentence id="121">I'll tell you about that. </sentence><sentence id="122">There was a <span class="interior space">bathtub</span> which was outside the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was made of metal and it was brought in on the Thursday, I think, every Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="124">So that we could all take a <span class="interior space">bath</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">And hot water had to be boiled and filled and then the three of us had a <span class="interior space">bath</span> in that thing. </sentence><sentence id="126">And then when we had our hair washed, we were very well protected because in those days there was no insulin and so lots of people lost children if they were not well looked after, because they had colds or all kinds of other illnesses. </sentence><sentence id="127">So my mother was very protective of us and when our hair was washed, she would put a scarf around it, we couldn't go out anywhere, you know. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, in any case, when I did this -- I did a tape for my children when I told this story about the <span class="interior space">bathtub</span>, my sister was very upset with me because she said I shouldn't be telling things like that. </sentence><sentence id="129">But I thought it was quiet interesting because it was all done very -- you know, it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="130">We enjoyed having our <span class="interior space">bath</span> inside the <span class="building">house</span>, and then my father got into that water. </sentence><sentence id="131">Of course, naturally, you couldn't boil enough water for everybody to have fresh <span class="interior space">bath</span>, so you all managed to get a <span class="interior space">bath</span> in that <span class="spatial object">tub</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">It was a very, very beautiful life. </sentence><sentence id="133">That's all I can say about it. </sentence><sentence id="134">We loved it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: What about <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="156">Were you in <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="160">We were in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="161">There was a problem about the <span class="building">school</span>, though. </sentence><sentence id="162">I had a problem about it. </sentence><sentence id="163">We in the minority, of course. </sentence><sentence id="164">There was -- I think there was one, only one, maybe two Jewish children in the <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">And talking about <span class="building">school</span> prayer, that really had an impact on me. </sentence><sentence id="166">| really minded very much not to have to -- you know, it was a Catholic country, <span class="country">Slovakia</span>, right? </sentence><sentence id="167">So the prayers were said every morning in <span class="building">class</span>, and I could not -- of course not, I could not participate in that, and I wouldn't, of course. </sentence><sentence id="168">My father -- well, I couldn't; I was Jewish, so I couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="169">But I minded being different, I really -- I mean, if there's a discussion about prayer in <span class="building">school</span>, this really has said something to me because I definitely felt very left out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170">And I wanted to very much like everybody else, and since there were so few Jewish children, I felt that I was different from everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="171">The <span class="building">school</span>, I looked forward very much to going to <span class="building">school</span>, but once I started going, I soon realized that it was not so much fun after all, because we were really punished quite severely in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">We were punished by being beaten on our hands, you know, with a stick. </sentence><sentence id="173">Or we had to kneel in front of the <span class="building">class</span> if we did something that was unacceptable in some way or we talked, whatever we did. </sentence><sentence id="174">And I was punished quite often, and I had to kneel in front of the <span class="building">class</span> because I clowned around. </sentence><sentence id="175">And then I got punished some more, and I got hit on my hands quite often, but I did quite well. </sentence><sentence id="176">We had <span class="building">elementary school</span> and <span class="building">high school</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">The <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, which was like a <span class="building">junior college</span>, was in a <span class="populated place">town</span> which was two hours away from our <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="178">My parents decided that my older sister who was very much like my mother, she was very interested in being a  housewife -- when she was asked what she wants to be when she grows up, she wanted to be a mother. </sentence><sentence id="179">And so it was decided that she was going to go to a <span class="building">local high school</span>, and when I finished <span class="building">elementary school</span>, it was decided that I would be going to this <span class="building">junior college</span> two hours away from the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">So I traveled every single day by <span class="spatial object">train</span> two hours to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">I got up at 6 -- 5 o'clock in the morning or whatever; 5:30, 6:00. </sentence><sentence id="182">My father walked me through the <span class="env feature">snow</span> with a lantern to the <span class="building">station</span>. </sentence><sentence id="183">I was put on the <span class="spatial object">train</span>, which was about two <span class="spatial object">carriages</span>, and we traveled to , Which </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Yes, I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: How? </sentence><sentence id="187">Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: I did -- well, I did and I didn't, let's put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had a lot of -- I had a lot of non-Jewish friends, of course. </sentence><sentence id="192">But the people who were worse off than I were the Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="193">We had a little Gypsy girl, her name was Suzie, Suzka (ph), and she was not allowed to -- she had to sit by herself in the <span class="building">class</span> in the <span class="interior space">back row</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">I mean, I was part of the whole -- I mean, just like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="195">The only thing that was different was the <span class="building">school</span> prayer. </sentence><sentence id="196">But she was completely ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="197">She was sitting in the <span class="interior space">back row</span>, and she was not allowed to -- nobody sat next to her. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was sort of -- felt very sorry for her, and I used to -- I had made sort of a friendship with her, but she was worse off. </sentence><sentence id="199">I minded taking the Jewish holidays, not going to <span class="building">school</span> during the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="200">I minded that, because everybody else was in <span class="building">class</span> and I was not. </sentence><sentence id="201">And then I minded very much not participating in the Christmas and other holidays because we had a maid and she would take us -- I mean, we had lots of <span class="building">churches</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">It is a very -- it was mainly Catholic, very religious sort of community. </sentence><sentence id="203">In the wrong sense, they were not religious in the sense of being good. </sentence><sentence id="204">But they were in the religious going to <span class="building">church</span>, that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="205">Because they had came to it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="206">Most of them, I mean, many of them -- I don't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="207">I don't want to go into it, but there were no Germans that entered our <span class="populated place">village</span> as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="208">So whatever was done to the <span class="populated place">community</span>, <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>, was done by the local people. </sentence><sentence id="209">You know how this turned out. </sentence><sentence id="210">I mean, I didn't really investigate it too deeply, but I know there were no Germans in the <span class="populated place">village</span> at all. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I think that most of the things that happened to us, to our people, were greed. </sentence><sentence id="212">Because everybody expected or thought that we were all rich, that all the Jewish people were rich, which they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="213">Everybody was working very hard. </sentence><sentence id="214">It's true that most of the <span class="building">stores</span> were owned by the Jewish people, but they were little <span class="building">stores</span> eking out a small living. </sentence><sentence id="215">And I think that -- I don't know, my parents protected us a great deal from the outside, so I don't know that I felt -- I did feel different in having to take the days off for the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="216">And the <span class="building">synagogue</span> was right across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">school</span>, my <span class="building">elementary school</span> that was. </sentence><sentence id="217">After I went to <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, I was out of it. </sentence><sentence id="218">I didn't go to the <span class="building">local schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="219">But then all the kids went to <span class="building">school</span>, and I was outside the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, and I felt so different. </sentence><sentence id="220">I didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="221">I felt that I was -- I wanted to be like the others, that was the main thing. </sentence><sentence id="222">And I think that was the main thing about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: But people weren't calling you names or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Oh, they were. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were, yes. </sentence><sentence id="260">And there were very many things like that, but, I don't know, one sort of learned to live with it, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="261">I minded. </sentence><sentence id="262">I mean, yes, people were always calling us names. </sentence><sentence id="263">But I seemed to get over it the best I could. </sentence><sentence id="264">I mean, I didn't seem to -- yes, I guess I must have. </sentence><sentence id="265">I did mind it, basically. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I never particularly remembered that so much. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: But these were your friends? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Oh, my friend, my best friend, was the daughter of the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="269">My father -- going back to my father, okay. </sentence><sentence id="270">My father was extremely popular in the <span class="populated place">village</span> because he was very handy. </sentence><sentence id="271">He could do things that other people couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="272">When a <span class="spatial object">cross</span> fell from one <span class="building">church</span> in a storm, my father was the one who climbed the <span class="dlf">steeple</span> to put the <span class="spatial object">cross</span> back up. </sentence><sentence id="273">And everybody stood in the whole <span class="populated place">village</span> watching him do it, and I thought always that my parents would survive. </sentence><sentence id="274">All through the war, I thought my parents would survive because of the sort of things he did in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">He was very popular, and once when there was a fire and the mayor was drunk, my father broke down the <span class="dlf">door</span> to the <span class="spatial object">fire engine</span> and got it out and drove to the fire. </sentence><sentence id="276">He was very liked in the <span class="populated place">community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">He was a hard working man who worked from morning to night, and he did all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="278">We had a little bit of a -- we didn't have a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, but we had a plot of <span class="region">land</span>, and he did all things like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="279">He worked just as much as that, and he was liked. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I thought people would look after him, but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="281">I don't really know all the details of what went on. </sentence><sentence id="282">When I read my mother's letters, which I haven't read, maybe I'll find out more. </sentence><sentence id="283">But the problem is that my parents would not have written anything that was going on, because they would have been trying to protect us from that kind of information. </sentence><sentence id="284">So they -- so, unfortunately, I wish my mother would have been more open about what was happening to them. </sentence><sentence id="285">But, you know -- you were asking me about .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Well, we were talking a little bit being Jewish in this <span class="populated place">community</span>, but I think you've talked about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: I'm sure there was a lot -- there was quite a lot of name calling in the <span class="populated place">community</span>, yes. </sentence><sentence id="307">They called, not me particularly, but they would call all people who were selling eggs or people who were poor and old, they were calling them names and throwing stones and doing things, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="308">There was a lot of that. </sentence><sentence id="309">But, and I told you, we were very protected and we were very close close-knit community in the <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">And our parents were -- looked after us and didn't let us see much of this. </sentence><sentence id="311">And -- but I did mind, for instance, of course, there were so many <span class="building">churches</span> that I told you, and there was Christmas everywhere, you know, and we didn't participate. </sentence><sentence id="312">And I didn't like that, I love Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="313">I thought Christmas was very appealing, and the snow was beautiful, and people were selling all these lovely decorations for the <span class="env feature">Christmas trees</span> and we couldn't have any. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: You said you were protected, you really didn't have too much sense of what was going on outside of your <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: You were somewhat isolated. </sentence><sentence id="327">I'm just wondering if you had heard or read anything about Hitler or the Nazi Party in <span class="country">Germany</span> or if you think your family had any  information about what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

went to a movie, and it was a Jewish holiday and we were really glad to get back to the <span class="building">home</span> because we were able to observe the second night of Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="1163">Because my uncle, we did nothing at my uncle's <span class="building">house</span>, and we were glad to get <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="populated

there was an addition built to the <span class="building">house</span>, a temporary addition, to house the children. </sentence><sentence id="1174">So we all lived in the back of the <span

children. </sentence><sentence id="1176">And we had all kinds of things that were being done for us, all kinds of tutoring. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And my older sister had to help in the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1185">And through the <span class="country">United States</span>, my father had a brother in <span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>, <span

to proceed to try to get us over to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And I have letters and affidavits which they immediately started to do, but it was too late because, first of all, we didn't even want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1189">The three of us didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1190">We wanted to stay in <span

try to get us over, and he would send us letters and in the letter, he would sometimes send us a dollar or two dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And it was thrilling because we had so little money that we were always thrilled when we got a dollar, which was then five shillings, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1194">In any case, we didn't really want to go away from <span class="country">England</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1195">We wanted to stay together and go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1196">That was our thought, but we were so relieved when we didn't have to go to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1197">But my uncle wrote in this letter saying that they have enough resources to take care of all three of us. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Well, we stayed. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1239">Q: What were your parents saying in their letters? </sentence><sentence id="1240">It must have been great to get their mail. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1243">A: Oh, in the letters, my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Well, we wrote a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1245">They sent us packages, too. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And we wrote a lot of letters, also. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And they were very, very grateful because -- and they were always in -- well, I haven't read my parents" letters. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I have about, maybe, 30, 40 letters; I haven't read them because it's too painful to read my mother's letters. </sentence><sentence id="1249">But I am going to read them, and I'm going to translate them because -- not only for myself, but for my children and for whoever might want to see them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1257">Q: But at the time, do you have sort of a vague recollection of what they wrote about? </sentence><sentence id="1258"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1261">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1262">They wrote -- unfortunately, I wish they would have written exactly what was going on, but they wouldn't, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Why would they tell the children painful things? </sentence><sentence id="1264">But it must have been very, very difficult for them already in the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And it must have been -- and they wrote a little bit about my grandfather who obviously was having a terrible time because he had to leave his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1266">His <span class="building">house</span> was taken over by somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And they put him into some kind of a <span class="interior space">room</span> somewhere where he had no <span class="dlf">window</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Because my mother wrote saying that it must be very hard for her father to be living without a <span class="dlf">window</span>, so I don't know where they had put him. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And they wrote us things like sent us recipes because we said be sure to send us a recipe about this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And then we would write them to say what we were doing, what we're learning, and what we were sewing, and what we were crocheting, and what we were knitting. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And we would describe in great detail what we got for our birthdays and what -- we just gave them the most enthusiastic reports about our life in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And they were just thrilled about getting the letters, of course, and they would say how grateful they were that we were such good children and that we were telling them, that we were writing to them so regularly. </sentence><sentence id="1273">Because that's the only thing, of course, that they had that was joyful. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And they sent us -- I remember my mother sent us packages of knitted things, sweaters, and cookies probably. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Whatever she could do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1291">Q: Were you homesick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1293">A: Oh, terribly homesick. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Many of the children in the <span class="building">home</span> were very fortunate because they were just there temporarily until their parents got out. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Those were the worst times in our lives when other children's parents came to get them. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Because we felt terribly envious, I should say, but at the same time, we were too ashamed not to be happy for the child, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1297">Because you had to be happy for the child. </sentence><sentence id="1298">But, on the other hand, you knew that you never, your parents are never going to come out because the war had started and it was -- and it was just completely -- well, completely hopeless. </sentence><sentence id="1299">We could have done -- I always wonder whether we could have done something to get them out, but we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Because, first of all, it was July and August, two months, and the war broke out in September. </sentence><sentence id="1301">So after that, it was over; you couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So we only would have had two months to do something in. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Then my mother wrote to say that my grandmother came to stay with them from <span class="country">Poland</span>, and so that they couldn't leave anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And I feel my parents were -- my father was very enterprising. </sentence><sentence id="1305">My mother was a very bright, intelligent woman, and they would have certainly tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1306">My father always wanted to leave long before we left. </sentence><sentence id="1307">He wanted to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, but my mother wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1308">He wanted to, he would have gone long ago. </sentence><sentence id="1309">He was a great Zionist, he would definitely left long ago if my mother -- but my mother would not leave. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Because my mother's family has been in the <span class="populated place">village</span> for many generations, and my mother was very, very assimilated into the community. </sentence><sentence id="1311">So she would not, she didn't want to leave to go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1312">But my father may have tried. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Well, he would have gone. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Where  2 would he have gone? </sentence><sentence id="1315">If he had escaped, he would have probably gone into <span class="country">Poland</span>, which was going to be the end, the worst end. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Or maybe they might have continued on to <span class="country">Hungary</span>, I don't know where they would have gone. </sentence><sentence id="1317">But my uncle -- I know that my husband's aunt, who came to <span class="country">England</span>, got everybody out from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Certain people, because she went around -- but she was much older. </sentence><sentence id="1319">She was in her 30s late, and she went around and she got signatures for all her family. </sentence><sentence id="1320">Now, we were too little to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1321">Now, if I reproach myself about anything at all, it is because I felt if we had been a little older we might have been able to get my parents out. </sentence><sentence id="1322">But who know? </sentence><sentence id="1323">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1324">In any case, so they wrote us these -- my mother wrote these long letters. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I said to her in my letter "We're off the <span class="dlf">road</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1326">And I have a couple of those letters because when I went back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and I was given that book, a book with some photographs, among those things were two of our letters, which I was just amazed how well we wrote. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And, well, when... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: You mentioned that you kept a <span class="spatial object">diary</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I kept a diary while I was at this <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1369">Q: What kind... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A: Which is very good. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I'm sorry now that I didn't keep it more carefully, but I kept it for about until about 1941, when I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Because in 1941, we had to leave the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Suddenly -- you see, this <span class="region">area</span> was near the <span class="env feature">coast</span>, and besides the money -- whoever supported this <span class="building">home</span>, whichever organization supported which could have been American. </sentence><sentence id="1375">I think American and British, I don't know who did. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I don't know where the money came from actually. </sentence><sentence id="1377">That stopped and also that <span class="region">area</span> was restricted and everybody had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1378">So we had to be -- this is where the problems started. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We had to be sent somewhere, and that became a great, big problem because where to send the children. </sentence><sentence id="1380">What to, you know -- oh, I have to go back to when I told you about parents coming to get the children, it was very, very painful. </sentence><sentence id="1381">The other thing which was extremely for me, but I'm a great -- I'm able to sort of push it aside and look at the more positive things and to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1382">I'm a survivor, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1383">When I went to the <span class="populated place">village</span> and I saw parents walking with their children hand in hand, that broke my heart. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I used to be terribly upset about that because I felt -- that's when I felt the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1385">You know, but, otherwise, you look forward in the letters. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I mean, that's about it, and the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Then we had to worry about what to do because everybody had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And my little sister -- the older children had to leave first. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And that's it began to dawn on us. </sentence><sentence id="1390">Of course, there were air raids. </sentence><sentence id="1391">While we lived already in the <span class="building">home</span> still, air raids started. </sentence><sentence id="1392">But we were -- well, we had to be sort of split up because my older sister was sent to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and she went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1393">There was a young women's home run by a Jewish refugee woman. </sentence><sentence id="1394">She had an ordinary <span class="building">house</span> in which she had housed, maybe she had 10 or 12, 20 girls who lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1395">It was a <span class="building">house</span> that was a <span class="building">hostel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And she provided breakfast and dinner, and she also ran something called the <span class="building">British Restaurant</span>, where she cooked where you could buy  3 cheap meals. </sentence><sentence id="1397">But I think she just ran the <span class="building">hostel</span>; it was in <span class="populated place">Hampstead</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1398">So my sister was sent to <span class="populated place">London</span>, and she went to that <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1399">And she -- but she had to be self-supporting, so she went to work in a <span class="building">dressmaker shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And she was -- then whatever she earned, she paid in that <span class="building">home</span> to live there. </sentence><sentence id="1401">My younger sister was sent to some families not far from the <span class="building">home</span> where we were at. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And she lived with some Quaker families, and she was very, very unhappy about having to be split up from us. </sentence><sentence id="1403">She was very heartbroken about that because she just didn't want to leave us, but there was no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1404">This is where my older sister blamed my uncle, that he should have taken her. </sentence><sentence id="1405">But by this time, my uncle has lost his -- there was no job because the representation from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> when the war broke out, that was over. </sentence><sentence id="1406">There was no more income, and he was not qualified to do -- he was an engineer, chemical engineer, but he had no job. </sentence><sentence id="1407">The war started, and he didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="1408">At that point, he couldn't have taken her. </sentence><sentence id="1409">Or maybe he could have, and they could have done the best they could with the little they had, but they just didn't take her. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And that, at this point, it is that my sister blames them because she felt they should have taken my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Now, my little sister, even though my older sister and my little sister had this guardian, Myra Hess (ph), who I think paid the money that was only a cash transaction, I think she guaranteed for 70 children, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1412">She didn't have anything personally, she drove a -- so my little sister had a hard time because I don't know what kind of family she stayed with, but she was moved around a great deal from family to family. </sentence><sentence id="1413">And she told me that on Friday afternoons in <span class="building">school</span>, they would say, "Who is going to take Ellie? </sentence><sentence id="1414">Who can take Ellie for maybe next week or next holiday?" </sentence><sentence id="1415">or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And she just remembers that mainly that people would ask who will take her. </sentence><sentence id="1417">But then she had some positive things about staying with those families because she did have it regular. </sentence><sentence id="1418">She went to <span class="building">school</span> through the entire <span class="dlf">system</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1419">She matriculated and she did everything that any English child does. </sentence><sentence id="1420">She did have that privilege. </sentence><sentence id="1421">She went through the entire system of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Now, with me it was a different story. </sentence><sentence id="1423">When I came to <span class="populated place">London</span> and there was guardian, Fannie Bandit, who was just -- she was wonderful in one respect. </sentence><sentence id="1424">She just loved having this child, me. </sentence><sentence id="1425">But she didn't want me to live with -- I mean, there was no question of my living with her. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Although she lived in a very elegant <span class="interior space">apartment</span> on <span class="dlf">Penchley (ph) Road</span>, and she had a housekeeper and I used to go to -- I was invited for lunches and whatever, and it was splendidly elegant. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I can't tell you how beautiful and elegant it was because she was a grand lady. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And she -- I mean, when I was invited for lunch, everything was set up just as if it was an important visitor had come, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1429">I mean, the crystal and the silver and the dishes, and we would go to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> and then the housekeeper would come and serve the meal from the left. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And we had to help our -- I mean, I learned all my good manners at my guardian's and she had this beautiful <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> with a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span> that flushed. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And she had all these lovely things and I just loved being with her, but there was no question of her taking me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1432">But when this <span class="building">home</span> broke up in <span class="country">England</span>, in <span class="populated place">Wyberley</span>, <span class="populated place">Burgess Hill</span>, my uncle went, this guardian with me and said, "Look, she can no longer stay in the <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1433">You could do something." </sentence><sentence id="1434">And I sat in the next <span class="interior space">room</span>, and they argued and she said, "But you promised me that you only needed a signature from me. </sentence><sentence id="1435">You told me  4 that I wouldn't have to do anything." </sentence><sentence id="1436">And he said, "Yes, but I didn't know there was going to be a war, and this thing fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="1437">The <span class="building">home</span> is no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Somebody's got to take care of her." </sentence><sentence id="1439">And she said, "But you promised." </sentence><sentence id="1440">And, you know, she just didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And so I sat there absolutely stricken with fear, and I hated that they argued about me like this. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And so I said to myself will they be able to come and ask me what I'm going to do, what I want to do. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And so I will have to tell them quickly, and what can I do that I could earn my living? </sentence><sentence id="1444">Because my sister was already earning her own living, and I didn't have any skills. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So I said to myself I will say that I can wash hair because that doesn't require any skills. </sentence><sentence id="1446">So when they came out and she said to me "Well, what do you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="1447">What do you want to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1448">And I said, "I can be a hairdresser; I can wash hair." </sentence><sentence id="1449">And she said no, or my uncle said no. </sentence><sentence id="1450">In any case, they came to some arrangement where he begged her to send me to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And she said, okay, she would do that. </sentence><sentence id="1452">She finally agreed to it after a long argument, and she said, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1453">they agreed that he would go to <span class="populated place">Bexley</span> (ph) College to talk to them to see whether they would take me. </sentence><sentence id="1454">Because | didn't speak English really. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And she said, "Okay, I will pay for the <span class="building">school</span>." </sentence><sentence id="1456">And my uncle said, "She can stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="1457">I'll put her up until she learns to short and type." </sentence><sentence id="1458">And so my uncle whose wife had been evacuated with the baby to the <span class="country">country</span>, lived in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> by himself. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And he said he would be able to take me until I'm out of -- as long as I'm in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1460">So my guardian said, okay, she will pay for the <span class="building">school</span>, and as far as I remember, she said she would pay him maintenance for me. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And she would give me five shillings pocket money a week. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And so my uncle went to the headmaster of <span class="building">Bexley (ph) College</span>, and begged him to take me because the headmaster said, "I can't take her to , she doesn't speak English." </sentence><sentence id="1463">And he begged him, he said,  5 all she could do. </sentence><sentence id="1464">You know, she just didn't know how to do anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And she would invite me to spend weekends with her sometimes, and she had a huge family in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And none of them every thought of including me in anything. </sentence><sentence id="1467">They had children my age or younger, but this was a Jewish family in <span class="populated place">London</span> and they did not want me in this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1565">Q: What did you make of this at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1567">A: Felt very -- I felt it was unkind. </sentence><sentence id="1568">Unkind. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I felt -- they had birthday parties going for little children, for children -- I was never included in anything. </sentence><sentence id="1570">They didn't -- but now when I go to <span class="populated place">London</span>, they try to make a big fuss of us. </sentence><sentence id="1571">But in those days, they didn't think of doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="1572">But it destroyed many Jewish families that they did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1579">Q: Could you accept your guardian's <span class="dlf">limits</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1581">A: Yes, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1582">Because she was truly loving and she -- oh, one thing I must mention in this. </sentence><sentence id="1583">For as long as she lived afterwards whenever we saw each other, whenever she was in any company at all, she would tell the story that I wanted -- "she wanted to be a hairdresser, but I saved her from this." </sentence><sentence id="1584">Well, I let her go on telling that story until towards the very end of her life when I was with nieces and nephews, all those fancy nieces and nephews, I mean, hew nephew had invited me to dinner one day when I was older and attractive and he was a young officer in the British Army. </sentence><sentence id="1585">When he invited me to dinner, it would be at the <span class="building">Savoy Hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1586">You know, the fanciest place in <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1587">In any case, I told him when I saw them the last time, I said, "Your aunt always told you that I wanted to be a hairdresser. </sentence><sentence id="1588">That was her story." </sentence><sentence id="1589">And I told him the story that it wasn't because I wanted to be a hairdresser, but because I didn't want her to feel that she should be having to pay for me, because I needed to earn my own living. </sentence><sentence id="1590">So that was the story about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1601">Q: They didn't teach you English at the first <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1603">A: Yes, they did, but it was not sufficient to be able to take -- I mean, it was basic English. </sentence><sentence id="1604">I mean, the first words in English that I learned, I needed to learn words that would take care of my sister, my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="1605">Because my little sister was not very well. </sentence><sentence id="1606">She was -- what do I say? </sentence><sentence id="1607">Not sickly, not really sickly, but she was the baby at <span class="building">home</span>, she was spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And she was frail, that's the word. </sentence><sentence id="1609"><span class="dlf">Frail</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1610">And I said I must learn to tell people that she is not well, but I didn't know how to say it. </sentence><sentence id="1611">So I would learn -- the first thing I learned was to say, "My sister has a headache." </sentence><sentence id="1612">Those were my first English words.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2066">A: My younger sister got married shortly afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="2067">Came to <span class="populated place">London</span> and married. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And I stayed in <span class="country">America</span>, but I must tell you I did go back to <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1970 for the first time to my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2069">It was shortly after the Communists -- the Communists were still there, but it was shortly after Deutsch-Czech (ph) government started making -- the <span class="populated place">Prague</span> -- you know, there was this revolt against the government. </sentence><sentence id="2070">I did go back; I wanted to go back, I wanted to go back to the <span class="populated place">village</span> because all my life there was something that was bothering me. </sentence><sentence id="2071">| did not really settle down, neither in <span class="country">England</span> nor <span class="country">America</span>, even when I was married and had three children. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Something bothered me very much, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I never felt really at <span class="building">home</span> anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2073">So finally we decided we would go back to the <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2074">We were going to go during the Deutsch-Czech (ph), before the Communists took -- but then I got cold feet. </sentence><sentence id="2075">But my husband insisted that we do go back, and so we went to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2076">We rented a <span class="spatial object">car</span>, we drove to my <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2077">We got to my <span class="populated place">village</span> at 6 o'clock in the evening, and it was totally changed. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Totally changed. </sentence><sentence id="2079">There were huge <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I mean, it was under the Communist regime, they built these huge <span class="building">concrete buildings</span> and the <span class="populated place">village</span> was so transformed, I could not find my way. </sentence><sentence id="2081">In any case, I said to my husband if we go -- the first thing I did when we got to the <span class="populated place">village</span> -- it was 6 o'clock in the evening -- I asked the people about my friend, Eva . </sentence><sentence id="2082">I didn't  4 <span class="building">district building</span> to see whether we could transfer the <span class="building">house</span> to him, whether they could buy the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2083">And when we got -- I didn't want to do it, but I went with him. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And when we got there, this woman who was keeping the books looked up to see whether any taxes are owed on the <span class="building">house</span>, and then she said to me, "If you decide to sell the <span class="building">house</span>, will you sell it to me?" </sentence><sentence id="2085">I said, "I'm not selling anything. </sentence><sentence id="2086">I'm not staying." </sentence><sentence id="2087">In any case, at 10 o'clock, I said to my husband, "I've got to get out of this <span class="populated place">village</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I've got to get out of here." </sentence><sentence id="2089">So we took a little walk. </sentence><sentence id="2090">We went to the <span class="env feature">woods</span> where I used to go. </sentence><sentence id="2091">That's when I saw that big <span class="dlf">grave</span> and the monument to the people, and then we got into the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2092">I said, "We've got to get out of here, and don't stop." </sentence><sentence id="2093">We got there at 6 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2094">At 10 o'clock in the morning, we were on our way out. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And we drove fast to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>, as fast as we could. </sentence><sentence id="2096">And we almost got shot by the border guards because my husband didn't realize that somebody was trying to stop us, because somebody was flashing a lantern. </sentence><sentence id="2097">He thought it was a bicyclist, and it was the <span class="building">border guard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2098">But I was so ill in the back <span class="spatial object">seat</span>, I was sick all the way to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2099">I was so ill on my journey <span class="building">home</span>, and I said to him -- I just lay there being sick all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2100">I said, "Don't. </sentence><sentence id="2101">Just get to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and get the best <span class="building">hotel</span> you can. </sentence><sentence id="2102">I need to get into the best <span class="building">hotel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2103">You just get there as fast as you can." </sentence><sentence id="2104">So we arrived in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> at whatever time it was, 11 o'clock at night. </sentence><sentence id="2105">We went to the <span class="building">hotel</span>, the best <span class="building">hotel</span> he could find. </sentence><sentence id="2106">I went <span class="interior space">upstairs</span> and I lay down and slept, and they went out -- my son and Peter went out to dinner. </sentence><sentence id="2107">And I just slept and slept. </sentence><sentence id="2108">Woke up the next morning and just relaxed, and then I realized that this was the best thing that ever happened to me, that I went back. </sentence><sentence id="2109">I made my final journey <span class="building">home</span>, my return journey. </sentence><sentence id="2110">That's what I was waiting for all these years, to make the return journey. </sentence><sentence id="2111">Because I lived out of my <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="2113">And then we -- I came <span class="building">home</span>, and it was the best thing that could have happened. </sentence><sentence id="2114">When I drove to work through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span>, I used to work -- before that, I used to drive to work through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span>, and I used to say to myself almost every day, "This is very pretty, but it is not <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2115">There are no snowdrops here and no wild flowers." </sentence><sentence id="2116">And I missed it so much. </sentence><sentence id="2117">And then I came back from that trip; I drove through <span class="populated place">Rock Creek Park</span> and I said, "Well, strawberries and snowdrops are not everything." </sentence><sentence id="2118">And I was just -- suddenly, I realized that this is what was bothering me. </sentence><sentence id="2119">I just had to make the trip back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And even though I stayed there from 6:00 in the evening until 10:00 in the morning, it did it for me. </sentence><sentence id="2121">And I said, "I don't want to sell the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Just take it, do whatever you like, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I don't want to deal with the <span class="building">house</span>." </sentence><sentence id="2124">Which I felt a little ashamed because my father put everything -- you know, he wanted us to have this, but I had to leave it behind. </sentence><sentence id="2125">I can't deal with it. </sentence><sentence id="2126">And that's when they told me about all the -- I mean, you know, nobody returned anything when my sister went back. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And when you think about what actually happened was that people were just greedy, and they wanted -- that was about the material things. </sentence><sentence id="2128">They wanted to take the things away from the people, from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2129">That gave them the license to take things away and to even kill, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2130">I mean, they put people in the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, and they didn't care what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="2131">But they were able to get into their <span class="building">houses</span> and take the <span class="dlf">property</span> away, okay? </sentence><sentence
