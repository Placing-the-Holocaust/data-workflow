<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to start by telling me your name, your date of birth, and your <span class="populated place">city</span> of birth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Father Henry Van Den Boogard and I was born in <span class="country">Holland</span> in in 1915, so I will be 80 in August. </sentence><sentence id="6">Maybe I don't look that old, but they gave me some makeup to look a little bit younger. </sentence><sentence id="7">I don't know if it works. </sentence><sentence id="8">What else do you want to know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your background? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My family went from , a big <span class="populated place">city</span> in the south of <span class="country">Holland</span> to a neighboring <span class="populated place">town</span>, that was smaller, and my father had a <span class="building">printing business</span> there, and he started a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="16">That is where I grew up there. </sentence><sentence id="17">I went there to <span class="building">grammar school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">When it was over my father put me in the <span class="building">school</span> in the neighbor <span class="populated place">city</span> and he thought that is a better <span class="building">school</span> for a <span class="building">high school</span>, but I didn't like it there. </sentence><sentence id="19">They had brothers there, religious people teaching, and I couldn't get along with the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="20">Everything that went wrong, I was always blamed for it, so I want to get rid of that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">I didn't know how I could get rid of that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">One day it was Ash Wednesday, and we catholics go to <span class="building">church</span> get a little bit of these ashes on your forehead. </sentence><sentence id="23">I thought this was a nice opportunity for me to miss the <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">So, I had to go by a later <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="25">In the meantime I was waiting I thought that <span class="spatial object">cross</span> that they put on my forehead was too little, so with some ashes I made it larger and each time a little larger and later it covered my whole forehead. </sentence><sentence id="26">I forgot about it and then I went by <span class="spatial object">bus</span> to <span class="building">school</span> and it was a very cold day. </sentence><sentence id="27">It was in 1929. </sentence><sentence id="28">When I came in the <span class="building">class</span>, all the boys started to langh because of that <span class="dlf">cross</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">I had forgotten it and I told the teacher I went to <span class="building">church</span> this morning to get the ashes, and he sent me out. </sentence><sentence id="30">He said get of here. </sentence><sentence id="31">I had to stay in the <span class="interior space">hallway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">And there I got my vocation I always tell because then I decided I don't want to go to this <span class="building">school</span> anymore, but how can I convince my father. </sentence><sentence id="33">I thought I'm going to tell him I want to go to the <span class="building">seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="34">He listened, so we went. </sentence><sentence id="35">I didn't think that I would be accepted because everybody told me you will be back <span class="building">home</span> after a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="36">So, when I came there, I thought I will fool them a little bit and I thought all the boys will become priests but I was the only one of the class who became a priest. </sentence><sentence id="37">What else do I have to tell? </sentence><sentence id="38">I was then 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went to the <span class="building">seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">I was accepted there, but I didn't expect and I prayed a lot that I wouldn't be sent <span class="building">home</span> because of my conduct. </sentence><sentence id="41">My prayers were answered I think. </sentence><sentence id="42">That's what I tell in my sermons, that the prayers are answered. </sentence><sentence id="43">I asked in my prayers that I wouldn't be sent <span class="building">home</span>, so they kept me there and I became a priest after 12, 13 years. </sentence><sentence id="44">I was ordained in 1942, and that was in the middle of the war. </sentence><sentence id="45">Before the war -- during the war already, in 1940, in 1942 more or less, there was a Jewish family in <span class="country">Holland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">They were good friends of my uncle, and this gentleman asked me if I could help him. </sentence><sentence id="47">He approached me when I was still a seminarian. </sentence><sentence id="48">He said can you do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="49">I see that it is difficult for us Jews in the <span class="country">country</span> with the Nazis and I would like to go hiding. </sentence><sentence id="50">He was married, and I said I will look into if 1 can find a place. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then in the meantime, my uncle found already a place with his brother, Louis Haza, and he had a sister, Anna Haza, and they both were single and they took him in. </sentence><sentence id="52">There was a husband and wife and a little daughter. </sentence><sentence id="53">The wife was pregnant and in the  time they were hiding there, the little boy was born, and it was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="54">But what happened to them later, their name was , and I never found out if they survived the war or not. </sentence><sentence id="55">When I was ordained in 1942, it was the last Sunday of July then the first Sunday of August was August 2. </sentence><sentence id="56">I said my first mass in <span class="country">Holland</span> and there was a big celebration in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">It was a <span class="populated place">town</span> of about in those days about 10,000, now there's 20,000 people, but there was a big celebration, and a parade and everything. </sentence><sentence id="58">In the afternoon there was a reception, and the mayor came also to the reception and his name was John , and he was very anti-Nazi, anti-German, and he was very sleepy when he came to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="59">He said you have to excuse me because the whole night I had to visit Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="60">I didn't know there were so many Jews in our <span class="populated place">home town</span>, but he had to tell them that they had to go into hiding because that same night they would be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="61">And there was a policeman and he was in favor of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="62">He fought always with the mayor because they had different opinions and the mayor was very anti-Nazi so at the end of the war he had to go into hiding himself. </sentence><sentence id="63">That is why I knew there were quite a few Jews in my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">Then I didn't do anything until I had a brother-in-law, his father was born in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">He just got married, then, in those days, and his father was born in <span class="country">Germany</span>, so the Nazis made all the decedents who were born in <span class="country">Germany</span>, they made them German so they could serve in the military service. </sentence><sentence id="66">But my brother-in-law didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="67">He was the husband of my sister who lives here with me now and my brother-in-law, his name was Robert . </sentence><sentence id="68">He died already about 20 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="69">He asked me if I could help him. </sentence><sentence id="70">So, I had to find out where he could go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="71">I found out then who the leader of the Resistance was in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="72">There was , in <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span> and he said oh he can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="73">And , would like to mention him because he did a lot for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="74">He's not living anymore but in those days everything was so secret he didn't tell me that he had a Jewish family in his <span class="building">house</span> too hiding. </sentence><sentence id="75">He was working with a priest who was a trappist before. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was still a trappist but they were kicked out of the <span class="building">monastery</span> by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="77">Then he had to find a place so he became a chaplain in a very large <span class="building">nun's convent</span> in <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">But he was only a name chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="79">What he did was working for people who wanted to go into hiding especially Jews. </sentence><sentence id="80">He did a lot. </sentence><sentence id="81">He was smuggling weapons and things like that and finding hiding places to keep those Jews alive. </sentence><sentence id="82">But he was not very prudent and we thought some day he will be arrested and it happened. </sentence><sentence id="83">He was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="84">His name was . </sentence><sentence id="85">I didn't name his full name, I knew only as Fonse, his nickname, but not his last name. </sentence><sentence id="86">I found it out later. </sentence><sentence id="87">He went to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> in 5 close to my <span class="populated place">hometown</span>, but he was last seen in the , in the <span class="building">police office</span> when he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="88">But we never heard of him later. </sentence><sentence id="89">We didn't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="90">Now, when the war was over, the leader of this Resistance in , he became the leader of this <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> where no Jews were anymore but were just the Nazi prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="91">I was then assistant in the <span class="region">North</span>, but I went to see him in the <span class="region">South</span> and I visited him, I said, did you ever find out what happened to Fonse, I said don't know, and he said I don't know either, but I know of a famous architect and he knows of somebody in the who works there and he was hiding with priests somewhere in the <span class="region">west</span> of . </sentence><sentence id="92">So, I got the address of the architect and this architect was making a model for a <span class="building">monument</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span> on the for the freedom we got after we were freed by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="93">He said this gentleman he works in an <span class="building">office</span> in the  . </sentence><sentence id="94">It was closed. </sentence><sentence id="95">So, I went there by <span class="spatial object">car</span>, that was given to me by the leader of the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="96">He's a soldier, so when I saw him, it was lunch time, there was nobody anymore in the <span class="building">office</span>, only one gentleman and he knew me. </sentence><sentence id="97">I said how do you know me. </sentence><sentence id="98">He said do you not know me anymore? </sentence><sentence id="99">You helped me go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="100">I said when was that? </sentence><sentence id="101">I said I have no hair I was a prisoner in and they cut my hair I was bald headed and he had a <span class="building">prison</span> suit on and I was going to be executed in the neighborhood of <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span> and they brought me there with other prisoners who were going to be executed too but then we were attacked by the <span class="spatial object">English planes</span> and we all left the <span class="spatial object">cars</span> and could go into hiding in the <span class="dlf">corn field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was not corn, it was wheat. </sentence><sentence id="103">We could crawl through the <span class="env feature">weeds</span> the <span class="dlf">fields</span> to the neighbor <span class="populated place">town</span> where I was living. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was during the hours that there was a curfew at night, so in the morning I had to go <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span> to bring some pictures of Jews who had to have false identification cards and there was a teacher in <span class="populated place">town</span> who took those pictures. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was an amature. </sentence><sentence id="106">He took those pictures, developed them at night, and early in the morning as soon as the hours were over of the curfew, then I was going to pick them up and bring them to <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span> to have my brother-in-law who was hiding he had to make those i.d. </sentence><sentence id="107">cards. </sentence><sentence id="108">So, when I went through the <span class="populated place">town</span> I saw in a <span class="interior space">hallway</span> of a <span class="building">house</span> I saw somebody standing in the suit of the prisoner's bald headed and he called me. </sentence><sentence id="109">He said can you find me a place where I can stay. </sentence><sentence id="110">I brought him then to a place where the brother of Doctor DeBeer, he was a physician, and his brother was a priest, he was in hiding too. </sentence><sentence id="111">I brought him there. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, as soon as I told me who he was, I thought this is not the one who was hiding with Fonse so I was just as far as I was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="113">I did find out. </sentence><sentence id="114">Later on I came to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> and I wanted to know so badly where Fonse was if he was still living or not so Thad on radio his name if somebody knew about him, his whereabouts to let me know. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, I got a letter from the abbot of the <span class="building">monastery</span>, he said as soon as you know let us know. </sentence><sentence id="116">We want to know what happened to him, too. </sentence><sentence id="117">I got a letter from his relative in <span class="populated place">Hague</span>, they wanted to know also where Fonse was, if he was still living. </sentence><sentence id="118">But then I got a letter from a doctor in , where the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="119">He said I saw when he was dead, I had to make a certificate that he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="120">He was killed on that day. </sentence><sentence id="121">It was two weeks after he was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="122">Now there is some monument for Fonse in that <span class="building">nun convent</span> and he's on the list of the ones who were killed in . </sentence><sentence id="123">But, now we don't know much about him, but I wanted to emphasize more what , the leader of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="124">And Fonse , this priest what they did for the Jews because it was never recognized. </sentence><sentence id="125">Nobody knew and nobody knew the names. </sentence><sentence id="126">They never gave the names, but I know, because I worked with them that they were hiding Jews making false papers for them, i.d. </sentence><sentence id="127">cards and trying to keep them alive by finding food so I would like to emphases that now that I have the opportunity to make it known what they did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, that is what I usually did. </sentence><sentence id="129">I didn't do much myself, only I did on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> brought id. cards to people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="130">Once I was asked by to bring a few guns in a <span class="spatial object">shoe box</span> on the back of my <span class="spatial object">bike</span> to the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I was living for the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">I did it and I put two Dutch catechisms on top of them so if I had to open maybe I thought it could save me. </sentence><sentence id="132">When I drove back on my <span class="spatial object">bike</span>, there were no <span class="spatial object">cars</span> on the <span class="dlf">road</span> anymore only and I saw far away that there was control by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="133">People some people had some food they took the food away, and they used it for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I thought, what will they do now. </sentence><sentence id="135">When I go back they will see that I have something to hide. </sentence><sentence id="136"> Then it's more dangerous for me. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, I thought, the Lord will help me. </sentence><sentence id="138">So, I went through it and when they stopped me, what's in that <span class="spatial object">box</span> and then I got an idea. </sentence><sentence id="139">I said I don't know what's going on today but the third time I have to open that books everybody wants to know what's in that <span class="interior space">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">Then he said okay go ahead, so I was shaking very much but I saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="141">That's what I did, but it got a little bit too dangerous for me there in the <span class="region">South</span>. </sentence><sentence id="142">They found out what I did, so I was advised to go into hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Okay, I just want to ask you a little bit more about this period in the <span class="region">South</span>. </sentence><sentence id="275">I'm going to back track a bit. </sentence><sentence id="276">When the Nazis came into <span class="country">Holland</span>, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="277">What was the reaction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="282">What was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I was in the <span class="building">seminary</span> and it was before I was ordained and I remember from a <span class="dlf">window</span> in the <span class="building">seminary</span> we were watching when they marched into the <span class="populated place">town</span>, and we were extremely mad because they invaded our <span class="country">country</span> and we tried to defend it with only a few days that our soldiers could defend our <span class="country">country</span>, but then they just overthrew us. </sentence><sentence id="284">There was no end to it. </sentence><sentence id="285">We were extremely mad, and then they were going to throw bombs, that was before. </sentence><sentence id="286">The older seminarians had to go into the <span class="interior space">basement</span> and we spent their nights and days in the <span class="interior space">basement</span>, but what was going on in other <span class="populated place">towns</span> we didn't know too well. </sentence><sentence id="287">I only went at night, early before the other seminarians and the teachers they got up. </sentence><sentence id="288">I went already to <span class="populated place">Rosenthau</span> on the <span class="spatial object">bike</span> after the curfew hours to bring pictures and books to the people who were hiding to keep them busy and to have their false i.d. </sentence><sentence id="289">cards made. </sentence><sentence id="290">It was all I knew about the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="291">I didn't know what was going on in other <span class="populated place">towns</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How did you know about this man who was leader of the Resistance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: There was a seminarian and he worked in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> too. , </sentence><sentence id="304">was his name, and he had relatives in the <span class="populated place">town</span> and they knew who their leader was, and I had to force him to let me know who he was and as soon as I knew, it was already before I was ordained, I went to see him. </sentence><sentence id="305">He was very friendly and he was living still quite a few years after we were liberated, but then he died. </sentence><sentence id="306">But his son is still living and his son is now I think he was in those days about 15 years old and he said his father was a little bit crazy. </sentence><sentence id="307">In those days he couldn't talk about anything after the liberation about then what he did during the war for the people who were hiding in the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="308">He was so proud of it, but during the Resistance he didn't tell anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: What motivated you? </sentence><sentence id="316">How come you decided to take this on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: It was just my Christian duty I thought to help people who were in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="320">I had to do what I could to help them, and it was also because it was for my relative, my brother-in-law to find a hiding place and then I thought I only have to find a hiding place and he was very intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="321">He knew several languages very well, but he didn't know Latin, he couldn't stand it so I brought him books to study Latin and books from the <span class="building">library</span> that he could read and I thought that is it. </sentence><sentence id="322">But then this leader , he wanted little by little, more and more to do something for the Resistance, so I came very much involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="323">So,  and <span class="building">Father Fonse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="324">Father Fonse I saw at <span class="building">house</span> very </sentence></p><p><sentence id="325"> often, and I knew that the only thing he did was working for the people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="326">He could go to <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">He had papers. </sentence><sentence id="328">He brought many people over the <span class="dlf">border</span> to bring them to <span class="country">England</span> and after there was a priest also in the <span class="building">seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="329">He was a teacher, and he had a contact with the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, but there was not a good contract because the people he recommended to bring to be brought to <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, they all got caught. </sentence><sentence id="330">They all got taken prisoners, so he asked me if I could give the address, so I gave the address of the contact I had. </sentence><sentence id="331">This priest died a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="332">Then when it got too warm for me I had to go there were many <span class="building">priests home</span> because during the war we wanted to go before the war already to the <span class="region">Mission countries</span>, to <span class="country">Indonesia</span> or <span class="region">South America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">I didn't care, but we couldn't leave the <span class="country">country</span> because we were occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="334">They didn't let us go, so I had to find a place to work as a priest so somebody found for me a place in the <span class="region">northern part</span> of <span class="country">Holland</span>, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335"> . [ </sentence><sentence id="336">became their assistant, but that was a <span class="populated place">town</span> that was quite abandoned and there were very poor people living in <span class="building">huts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="337">They were digging, one of those things used for fuel, like bread, this dried plants from centuries and they were living in <span class="building">huts</span> and that was an ideal place to hide their people in that place. </sentence><sentence id="338">There I knew some people that worked with me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="339">For example, a retired nurse. </sentence><sentence id="340">She was living across the <span class="dlf">street</span> directly her name was Sister Nista, they called the nurses always sister. </sentence><sentence id="341">She was not a nun but this Sister Nista, and she did a lot for the people that were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="342">She helped me a lot too. </sentence><sentence id="343">The pastor he acted like he was helping a lot but he was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="344">He was very afraid so I never told him what I did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="345">One day -- can I keep it for later -- is the tape almost finished because I cannot tell too much about the time I was up <span class="region">north</span>. </sentence><sentence id="346">One day I had at the beginning already several people hiding and they were from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and one day two ladies came on a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> all the way from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and I don't know how many kilometers, maybe 200 kilometers because it was close to the German <span class="dlf">border</span>, and they came and asked me where their husbands were. </sentence><sentence id="347">They knew that they were there and that I had them hiding and I gave them the addresses. </sentence><sentence id="348">They stayed a few days and then they went back to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, but I had a friend, who passed away in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, Father , and he couldn't write, so nobody knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="349">I said would you please give my regards to Father </sentence></p><p><sentence id="350"> who is in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> in the parish and tell him that I knew him well. </sentence><sentence id="351">So, they did. </sentence><sentence id="352">Father asked them is there still food in that place where he is, and they said it seems so because he's providing food for our husbands. </sentence><sentence id="353">Then I got a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> of kids from people -- should I tell that later? </sentence><sentence id="354">Father he collected many kids and they were catholic kids, Protestant kids and Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="355">He chartered a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> and he couldn't let me know but there was one nurse who came with those kids and the ones who owned the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> they went over and started to say , they came over <span class="dlf">canals</span> and <span class="env feature">rivers</span> to the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I was. </sentence><sentence id="356">One day on the first Friday of the month, I was hearing confessions and I saw a gentleman coming in <span class="building">church</span> and he looked around and he saw me and he came to me and said are you Father Henry from the <span class="dlf">beaugard</span> and I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="357">He said I am from <span class="populated place">Itica</span> and <span

enough to keep them alive in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> and Father collected them and he heard that there was still food so quickly I had to find all places, families who wanted to take a kid. </sentence><sentence id="359">But after that, after I had placed those kids, I didn't know their names. </sentence><sentence id="360">I  didn't know which religion they had. </sentence><sentence id="361">I didn't know anything about them. </sentence><sentence id="362">Later on, Jews came. </sentence><sentence id="363">They all got that address from Father , and then I got a couple of Jews and then I got another couple and then more and more and I never knew if they were Jewish or not, and I found places for them, and there was a baker. </sentence><sentence id="364">There was an organization also, an underground organization in that <span class="populated place">town</span> and there was a Protestant Minister and he belonged to that organization and he could get the rations, the coupons, and I got from him enough coupons all the time for all the people in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="365">But one day he asked me to give him a list of all the people who were hiding and where they were. </sentence><sentence id="366">I said I'm not going to do that because we are not going to give any names and I don't know their names. </sentence><sentence

people did you help? </sentence><sentence id="373">I said I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="374">I didn't know who was a Jew or who was not a Jew, but I knew there were many Jews among them, and there were a few who got a little bit homesick, and they wanted to go close to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="375">Then I there was no way to travel by <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">There was no <span class="spatial object">train</span> going any more, no <span class="spatial

</sentence><sentence id="378">Then I found I could borrow a few <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>, and then they had little boys who were strong enough for the ride from . </sentence><sentence

but the boy was strong enough to ride back to the <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="382">That was a whole day riding. </sentence><sentence id="383">I think it was. </sentence><sentence id="384">I don't know how far it was. </sentence><sentence id="385">I went with six people and it was a distance of a few hundred yards between me and the next one and the

</sentence><sentence id="387">Don't continue. </sentence><sentence id="388">I'll find you later, but we didn't need it. </sentence><sentence id="389">So, I did it several times to bring people back to

, and they got some tickets to cross the <span class="env feature">river</span> in the morning and in the evening, and the <span class="interior space">underground</span> they got hold of some of those tickets and they could give it us. </sentence><sentence id="391">So, those people were and got a ticket too and walked over the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> with those people to the other

quite popular there because people were saying since Father is here, something is done for the people that went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="393">It was known. </sentence><sentence id="394">I didn't tell people, but they found out anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="395">Then the pastor got a little bit jealous. </sentence><sentence id="396">He said before Father came here nothing was done, so much is done for the people that went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="397">That is why I didn't tell the pastor anything, but later on I had no more places to hide, no more families, then I asked the pastor can I use the <span class="interior space">parish hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="398">The <span class="building">parish hall</span> was not used for anything. </sentence><sentence id="399">He first said no and I got a little bit upset about it, and later he came to me and said it's all right, you can use the <span class="building">parish hall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="400">So, I found straw to sleep on and pots and pans and everything and then I had so many people because we are close to the <span class="dlf">German border</span>, it was at the end of the war and many people could come through -- it was a march between our <span class="country">countries</span> and we were about a mile from the <span class="dlf">German border</span>, and once I remember they told me that there were a few people they called , because there was a before and then many people were picked up and they had to work ina <span class="building">factory</span> and they could escape and then they went through the <span class="env feature">swamp</span> to their <span class="populated place">hometown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="401">Then they told me there are a few more, so I thought I'm going to meet them on the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">Then I saw them walking, and I knew one of them. </sentence><sentence

so on. </sentence><sentence id="408">They had gone through the march. </sentence><sentence id="409">There was a lot of <span class="env feature">water</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="415">His name was Chris , and then there was the one I knew from the <span class="building">seminary</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">What else can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="417">I had many kids in different places and I didn't know their names and I didn't know their religion but they had to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="418">Then I found out there were quite a few Jewish kids among them, too. </sentence><sentence id="419">There was one catholic boy and he heard two years ago when I was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Because you didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="493">It was too dangerous to find out the names. </sentence><sentence id="494">The names of those kids I don't know if it was in those days that you were hiding them if I knew the names, but I don't remember any. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't know if I got the names. </sentence><sentence id="496">I didn't know the names of the people we were hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="502">Q: Let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="503">When you were hiding people, did you just hide everybody that came through, or was there a priority? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: They had to have a note from Father in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>, and he signed it only A.V., Adrian , and then I trusted them. </sentence><sentence id="507">But one morning, in the middle of the night one day, I heard the bell ring very little, and I had my <span class="interior space">room</span> on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span> of the <span class="building">rectory</span> and I had my <span class="dlf">window</span> there outside and I looked out of the <span class="dlf">window</span> and there was a German soldier staying and they had long overcoats, and he said can I talk to you. </sentence><sentence id="508">I said what about. </sentence><sentence id="509">I would like to talk to you, so I let him in, and I thought I have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="510">He told me that he was a German soldier and that his family was in <span class="country">Germany</span>, but he said I don't think that we will win the war. </sentence><sentence id="511">I don't want to fight any more, I want to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="512">He asked me if I could give him the address of the leader of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="513">I said I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="514">I didn't trust him. </sentence><sentence id="515">I thought maybe that the Nazis that they sent him over in the middle of the night to find out who are the ones helping the Nazis and the people were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="516">I asked to the pastor's <span class="interior space">bedroom</span>, he said kick them out, kick them out. </sentence><sentence id="517">He was in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>. </sentence><sentence id="518">I gave him food. </sentence><sentence id="519">I gave him a sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="520">I said I'm sorry, I cannot help you. </sentence><sentence id="521">He left finally, after insisting very much about what the address is. </sentence><sentence id="522">I don't know any address. </sentence><sentence id="523">He said what do you do with people. </sentence><sentence id="524">Well, I tell them the same thing that I don't know how to help them. </sentence><sentence id="525">Later on I was very worried that maybe it is the truth that he was a real soldier that he wanted to go into hiding and my conscious was bothering me so much that I didn't help him. </sentence><sentence id="526">But I thought on the other hand maybe he would have given the names of the ones that were in the Resistance  and they all would be arrested, so I tried to forget about it, but I never could forget it. </sentence><sentence id="527">A few ladies later a policeman from the <span class="populated place">town</span> came directly and told me that it was too much known that I did something for people who were hiding and I had to go into hiding myself. </sentence><sentence id="528">So, I went to a couple a brother and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were single, and they were already older and he was a furniture maker, and I could go into hiding there, but it was not far from the <span class="building">rectory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="530">Through the <span class="dlf">window</span>, my <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> window I could see the <span class="building">rectory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="531">I watched at night all night if I could see Germans coming to the <span class="building">rectory</span> to pick me up, but I didn't see anybody, and after a week nobody came so I started again to live in the <span class="building">rectory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="532">That's about all I can remember from the time I was there in the <span class="region">northern part</span>. </sentence><sentence id="533">Everything was the same all the time. </sentence><sentence id="534">Helping Jews, helping other people who were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="535">People who were picked up a lot of them who had to work in <span class="building">factories</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span> who came through the march. </sentence><sentence id="536">I had to find places. </sentence><sentence id="537">I had to find food for them and to keep them alive. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was difficult because those people didn't get rations, and those people who got rations got very little too, so I had to go to that was another <span class="populated place">town</span> where many farmers, and I went through the <span class="dlf">fields</span> of the <span class="env feature">moss</span>, no, that dried stuff that they use for fuel, peat, there was only <span class="dlf">railroad track</span> for those small <span class="spatial object">railroad cars</span>. </sentence><sentence id="539">Take a <span class="spatial object">bike</span> over those <span class="dlf">beams</span>, and there was a shorter way too but there was no control. </sentence><sentence id="540">They went from <span class="dlf">farm</span> to <span class="dlf">farm</span> and back for some food. </sentence><sentence id="541">I got here potato and a little piece of meat so from a baker I got many rations from the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="542">I told you that already. </sentence><sentence id="543">I did have money. </sentence><sentence id="544">I got some money from a girl who was working in the <span class="building">black market</span> and her conscience was bothering her I think and she gave me sometimes 100 then 200 , money I used because there was not enough to buy all the food. </sentence><sentence id="545">So, I said, I will pay you back after the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="546">I don't have any money now. </sentence><sentence id="547">So, when I was on vacation from the <span class="country">United States</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span>, I went to that <span class="populated place">town</span> and that couple was still living, the <span class="building">baker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="548">The baker's wife said are you coming to pay the bill for all the bread you got here. </sentence><sentence id="549">I said oh, I forgot all about it anymore, but she died, but he is still living, and I saw him the last time I was in that <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="550">He was an old man in his 90s, but he was a good friend. </sentence><sentence id="551">Hartman was his name, and he helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="552">He had also people hiding in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="553">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, and I told you about the electricity. </sentence><sentence id="554">We were without electricity but we still had a <span class="dlf">line</span> outside. </sentence><sentence id="555">Now, it's all under the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and the Germans they cut it all to the <span class="building">houses</span>, but the baker still had electricity because he had to bake bread for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="556">One night I could steal that electricity to have light in the <span class="building">rectory</span>, but the pastor didn't want to know. </sentence><sentence id="557">One day yet very late and they went when it was already dark. </sentence><sentence id="558">They said it's now too dark to make the connection, I said no I don't want to sit by candle all night. </sentence><sentence id="559">So, but then it was in the dark and I couldn't see it too well and I missed it and it was sparking sparks like fireworks, sparks all over, and then I had to call an electrician early in the morning to restore it. </sentence><sentence id="560">The baker couldn't bake bread early in the morning for the Nazis, but they never found out. </sentence><sentence id="561">But people know now about it, but a few later last time I was in <span class="country">Holland</span> I went to that <span class="populated place">town</span> and I went to the <span class="building">church</span>, this is a new <span class="building">church</span> in another place and when I was there in the <span class="building">rectory</span> were very abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="562">I thought I go to the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> to see the names of the graves of the people I knew. </sentence><sentence id="563">There was somebody working in the <span class="dlf">cemetery</span> and I said, did you know all those people, he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="564">I said what's your name? </sentence><sentence id="565">He said are you a policeman or so? </sentence><sentence id="566">I said no I'm Father Henry Van Den Boogard. </sentence><sentence id="567">He said are you Father Henry Van Den Boogard? </sentence><sentence id="568">He hadn't seen me in 50 years and he married a girl who was a sister of the girl who worked at the <span class="building">rectory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="569">He came now  0 too to my golden wedding anniversary to the reception. </sentence><sentence id="570">There were about 16 people from that <span class="populated place">Parish</span> and they had to come all the way from the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: Yes, I think it was in "44 until the war was over in "45. </sentence><sentence id="678">No, I was there longer, a little more than a year, I think. </sentence><sentence id="679">Very close to the <span class="building">Rectory</span> there was a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="680">He had a big <span class="dlf">farm</span>, and he was a Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="681">He was from , and he was a Nazi, and he watched us all the time. </sentence><sentence id="682">I knew that they had to be very careful, but I didn't know his name. </sentence><sentence id="683">I didn't know what happened to him, but after the war all the Nazis were picked up and punished. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: No, not in the <span class="populated place">town</span> where I was because there was a <span class="dlf">highway</span> that went through the <span class="building">office</span> where the Nazis were controlling everything that came through, and then there was a side <span class="dlf">road</span> and maybe about two or three miles long and there was that <span class="populated place">town</span>, along side a small <span class="dlf">canal</span> where I lived, where all those poor people were living, and we were not bordered by Germans at all. </sentence><sentence id="694">Only they tried to find out later when I found that German soldier in the middle of the night standing there in front of the <span class="building">rectory</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">I wanted to have some names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="699">Q: What about Dutch Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Oh, yeah, they were hidden by the people. </sentence><sentence id="702">After the war they were picked up and they had to parade through the <span class="dlf">streets</span> with their hands on their head and soldiers surrounding with their  1 rifle and the people were shouting at them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="703">Also, the girls who dated German soldiers their hair was cut off completely. </sentence><sentence id="704">They were bald headed, and so I had some books with a lot of pictures but I lost them all in <span class="country">Chile</span>, pictures about the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and so on. </sentence><sentence id="705">During the war I didn't know too well what happened to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="706">I knew that that they were put in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, but I didn't know that they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="707">I heard it after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: When you were going around this <span class="region">area</span> looking for food, going to farmers, did they know why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
