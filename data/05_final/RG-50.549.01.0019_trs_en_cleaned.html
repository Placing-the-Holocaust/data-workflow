id="2">Lucine Horn: My name is Lucine Horn and my real name is Estelle Rubenlee. </sentence><sentence id="3">My maiden name. </sentence><sentence id="4">I am from <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> and presently I reside in the <span class="country">United States</span> since 1950. </sentence><sentence id="5">And this interview is being taken at my <span class="building">home</span> at <span class="dlf">4850 Westland</span> in <span class="populated place">Lincolnwood</span>, <span class="region">Illinois</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6">I offered to do this interview to tie in my video interview which I took for the <span class="building">Holocaust Museum</span> which involved my whole story of the war, Holocaust up until to the days of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="7">This will be just a follow up to what, what happened since 1945 January when I was liberated by the Russians in a very small <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="country">Poland</span>, to which I was taken with my husband after the <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> uprising, not the Ghetto uprising. </sentence><sentence id="8">The Polish uprising which took place in 1944, in October and as Poles there was no Jews at that time anymore. </sentence><sentence id="9">We were taken to <span class="region">southwest Poland</span> and dispersed to live with farmers. </sentence><sentence id="10">We were treated as refugees from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and we also were fighting for the <span class="building">Polish underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">As such the German government placed us with farmers and the farmers had to support all the people that they evacuated from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="12"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

for further information about this collection Interview with <span class="building">Lucine Horn 2</span> evacuated because the <span class="dlf">frontier</span> was on the <span class="env feature">Vistula River</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">The Russians were coming in from the <span class="region">East</span>. </sentence><sentence id="16">The Germans were on the other part of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> and they needed <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to be evacuated so that there was the <span class="dlf">frontier line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">We were taken to this very small <span class="populated place">town</span> and placed by these farmers who had no idea about our origins and we had to pretend constantly that we are not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="18">That was, that went on from October 1944 until January 1945. </sentence><sentence id="19">1 don't remember the date but that was the time when we were liberated by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="20">The Russians came all the way through to <span class="region">southwest Poland</span> and the Germans were just rapidly running away. </sentence><sentence id="21">The Russians liberated us and came into this little <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">We still could not show the enthusiasm of being liberated and show any love for the Russians which we did have at that time and still do because they did liberate us from Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="23">But the Poles were not very happy about the Russians coming into <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="24">And they didn't want the Russians to come to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to begin with and that's why they staged this horrible uprising in 1944 in September when 350,000 Poles were killed, was killed and the <span class="populated place">city</span> was practically 40% in ruins and destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="25">So we still had to pretend. </sentence><sentence id="26">Even so we were very happy to see them. </sentence><sentence id="27">And we stayed around about a week until we got our thoughts together of what we going to do now and how to proceed. </sentence><sentence id="28">We did want to go back to our <span class="populated place">home town</span> but it was quite far and of course the war was just happening, the war between the Germans and the Russians and there was no communications like <span class="spatial object">trains</span> or <span class="spatial object">buses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">Only that everything was in great chaos. </sentence><sentence id="30">But we said goodbye to the people to the farmers that we lived with and told them that we want to go back to our <span class="populated place">home town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="31">And we thought, they thought that we were from <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">So it took us maybe about ten days or two weeks to make it. </sentence><sentence id="33">Wasn't such a long stretch but we were doing it mostly by the foot and maybe we found a peasant that had a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> and he took us a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="34">And we were trying to go back to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="35">On the way we passed several <span class="populated place">towns</span>, small and big and we saw Jews come out from hiding so we

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Lucine Horn 3 kind of felt warm towards those people because they also survived. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a good sign that there was more survivors. </sentence><sentence id="39">Until we came back to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> to look for mostly to look for family and friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: If I could just ask you, you were saying as you were making your way to your <span class="populated place">home town</span> you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war, I'm wondering if you could describe a little more, do you remember how, you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that. </sentence><sentence id="85">And how you would feel inside. </sentence><sentence id="86">And would you have encounters with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Yes, it was a very chilling experience. </sentence><sentence id="91">The <span class="populated place">cities</span> were mostly desolate. </sentence><sentence id="92">And there weren't too many people walking around the <span class="dlf">streets</span> because the Germans had just passed through. </sentence><sentence id="93">We would come to a <span class="populated place">town</span> where maybe there was a <span class="dlf">square</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">And on the square people would congregate. </sentence><sentence id="95">And somehow, we always felt who it was Jewish or not. </sentence><sentence id="96">These people were completely different. </sentence><sentence id="97">I mean living in <span class="country">Poland</span> and knowing the Polish people, we knew how the Polish people behave and how they look. </sentence><sentence id="98">These Jewish people were like they are coming out from hiding. </sentence><sentence id="99">Their heads were down. </sentence><sentence id="100">They were sad. </sentence><sentence id="101">They still had the frightened look in their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="102">They were probably hiding someplace. </sentence><sentence id="103">Whether in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> or being hidden in some kind of a <span class="building">shack</span> you know. </sentence><sentence id="104">They did not appear like the other people do. </sentence><sentence id="105">And we kind of looked the same way I guess. </sentence><sentence id="106">And commonly we just like you know like dog to dog. </sentence><sentence id="107">We had something that pulled us to each other and we started to talk and it's the word to approach somebody was Am Who. </sentence><sentence id="108">Am Who means in Hebrew Am is <span class="country">Nation</span> and Who meant are you from the same. </sentence><sentence id="109">And somehow we saw these people. </sentence><sentence id="110">We saw quite a few of those people. </sentence><sentence id="111">And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="112">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="113"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Lucine Horn 4 we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there was the sadness of having lost everything. </sentence><sentence id="114">So that was more or less what happened but we didn't stay on. </sentence><sentence id="115">We just kept on going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: So you didn't talk to them very </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well we just briefly talked to them but everybody was just engaged in searching and doing his thing and we couldn't wait to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">We had a <span class="spatial object">knapsack</span> and we were tired from walking and not sleeping and, and you know took us maybe ten days or two weeks to get to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="147">Once we got to <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> there was a Jewish organization and they were registering all the people that were coming back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="148">A lot of it was a great influx of people from <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="149">And <span class="country">Russia</span> allowed these people to come back. </sentence><sentence id="150">And there were some people coming out from, very few from <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">The majority from <span class="country">Russia</span> and also some that were sent to <span class="country">Germany</span> for work. </sentence><sentence id="152">Like the able bodied, not Jewish looking, females mostly. </sentence><sentence id="153">Because males could always be checked out for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="154">Because of circumcision. </sentence><sentence id="155">So we met quite a few people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this <span class="building">Jewish committee</span>, we found that nobody that from our families had been registered so we kind of already thought that there's nobody there from the family. </sentence><sentence id="156">But nevertheless we tried to establish ourselves in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> because we just didn't' know what to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="157">And people were constantly coming. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was like every day when we went out to a <span class="dlf">town square</span> you could see a few people coming here and there. </sentence><sentence id="159">And of course being a small <span class="populated place">town</span>, maybe somebody that you knew. </sentence><sentence id="160">So some friends and acquaintances came. </sentence><sentence id="161">And some were in more need than others. </sentence><sentence id="162">Some were fighting with, on the <span class="region">Russian front</span> and were wounded. </sentence><sentence id="163">Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other. </sentence><sentence id="164">Also none of us had anything. </sentence><sentence id="165">And my husband met some family, he met </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Now it's in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="368">Now it's called <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="369">It used to be German. </sentence><sentence id="370">So after living for about 3 or 4 months in <span class="populated place">Blievitz</span>, we went to <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">And in October of that year, my husband met with some professors that knew him. </sentence><sentence id="372">And he was able to get in for 3"! </sentence><sentence id="373">year <span class="building">medical school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="374">We considered ourselves very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="375">I tried to get a job and somehow sustain ourselves you know in order for him to continue but we knew it's not going to be on a long time basis, because we did not want to live in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">That was just an absolute N O. We felt that we just cannot live ina <span class="country">country</span> that hurt us so much. </sentence><sentence id="377">And the memories are too painful and if you want to start a new life, it has to be someplace else, not in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: There you are right after the war in this place, as you say where all these horrible things that happened and you say there were memories everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="390">I'm wondering it's just so hard today to imagine being in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="391">I wonder if you could describe a little more what your day to day emotions were like. </sentence><sentence id="392">Would you say today that you were depressed or would you cry. </sentence><sentence id="393">Would you turn a <span class="dlf">corner</span> and see a certain place. </sentence><sentence id="394">I'm just trying to figure out what that would feel like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Well when we were in <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> it was indescribable how painful and hard. </sentence><sentence id="402">Because to give you an example to add insult to injury was the fact that the Poles were so hostile. </sentence><sentence id="403">Would we have been embraced by the people that we knew and that we grew up with and with people that also </sentence></p><p><sentence id="404"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="405">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked

Interview with <span class="building">Lucine Horn 9</span> suffered, but not to that extent. </sentence><sentence id="408">It would have been maybe half way bad. </sentence><sentence id="409">But the hostility was just so tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="410">My best girlfriend was pregnant 9 months. </sentence><sentence id="411">She came into <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="412">Her husband was killed on the front. </sentence><sentence id="413">That now this is this woman giving birth to a child. </sentence><sentence id="414">The first child born after the war. </sentence><sentence id="415">In a <span class="building">Catholic hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the nurses just damned this baby. </sentence><sentence id="417">God damn, Hitler didn't kill them all. </sentence><sentence id="418">We have to have a Jewish child now . </sentence><sentence id="419">It can't be helped. </sentence><sentence id="420">I mean this was just unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="421">But after we left <span class="populated place">Lublin</span> I knew that we had to be strong to survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="422">And the emphasis was mostly on survival and how and what to do. </sentence><sentence id="423">All the survivors were trying to just find a way, whether to go to the <span class="country">United States</span> or emigrate or go to <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">Illegally but do something for yourself because here you are already surviving the war. </sentence><sentence id="425">And you got nothing but your life, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="426">And now it's up to you to know which direction to take and which way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="427">It's like you're on an <span class="env feature">island</span> and you want to save yourself. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was a matter of not saving your life, as much as knowing what to do with yourself. </sentence><sentence id="429">And because we had this one direction that my husband wanted to finish <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="430">He didn't want to go into business. </sentence><sentence id="431">The easiest thing to do was to smuggle and to sell. </sentence><sentence id="432">Everything was still chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="433">So I just knew that we had to, that looking past is one thing and being hurt in it is another. </sentence><sentence id="434">But it's not going to help emotionally because you see we were very young and when you're young you're strong. </sentence><sentence id="435">You take life in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I just knew that we had to go on, make some right decisions and push

for people that were in <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> which I never was and even people that saw their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain think in the human nature that really wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="447">And you know and I cannot talk about it to other people, but this is what we felt. </sentence><sentence id="448">| And I knew that I have to help my husband and I gotajob. </sentence><sentence id="449">We gota little <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="450">And, in <span class="populated

knew that he has to wait a year just to get his papers. </sentence><sentence id="452">Cause once he gets all his papers that he finished 3 years <span class="building">medical school</span>, maybe wherever we go, to any <span class="country">country</span>, he's got at least something to show. </sentence><sentence id="453">And maybe he'll be able to continue. </sentence><sentence id="454">So that's exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="455">We were in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="456">We lived there almost a year. </sentence><sentence id="457">He finished <span class="building">medical school</span>, third year, got all the papers and then we decided out. </sentence><sentence id="458">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="459">We really have to sever all our, our relationships with <span class="country">Poland</span> and just erase it from our lives and just go on. </sentence><sentence id="460">And we had no gall. </sentence><sentence id="461">We didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="462">It was very hard at the time, you know to make any, any sense was, with your plans. </sentence><sentence id="463">But then we joined a Zionist group which was a student group. </sentence><sentence id="464">There was about 25 Jewish students, Zionist oriented and we thought that maybe if we go with a

<span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>, they took us, this BreiHa, they took us to <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="473">Because <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> was a big concentration of refugees and the <span class="building">American Joint</span> has been sponsoring a lot of places. </sentence><sentence id="474">And it was like a

</sentence><sentence id="475">And there was an awful lot of people at that time in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="476">And <span class="populated

students. </sentence><sentence id="478">And they might have a way for the Austrians to allow these peoples to study. </sentence><sentence id="479">Under pressure, without tuition because as a, as a part of a reparation of what happened to these people. </sentence><sentence id="480">And that really happened. </sentence><sentence id="481">The Americans helped us to get into the <span

class="building">university</span>. </sentence><sentence id="483">We had to, of course, qualify. </sentence><sentence id="484">There was all kinds of Latin examinations and everything to go through it. </sentence><sentence id="485">And have some papers to show. </sentence><sentence id="486">But it was an opportunity for my husband to continue and he fell for it right away. </sentence><sentence id="487">That was 1946. </sentence><sentence id="488">October. </sentence><sentence id="489">They helped us with some <span class="interior space">living quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="490">Of course it was very crowded and we had to share <span class="interior space">rooms</span> and things. </sentence><sentence id="491">But most of the people were single. </sentence><sentence id="492">There was only another married couple. </sentence><sentence id="493">And us. </sentence><sentence id="494">And we were helping each other. </sentence><sentence id="495">You know and <span

bit of that. </sentence><sentence id="498">You put it all in one <span class="spatial object">pot</span> and we had some soup at night. </sentence><sentence id="499">We felt kind of good about it because we knew that we had a goal. </sentence><sentence id="500">We knew that we're doing something for our future. </sentence><sentence id="501">And it wasn't very unpleasant because the Jewish student at that time, we came with a small group. </sentence><sentence id="502">But there were 400 Jewish students at that time in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence
