We were a happy family. </sentence><sentence id="40">My mother had 5 sisters and | brother. </sentence><sentence id="41">The brother was a very rich man. </sentence><sentence id="42">He didn't live too long in this <span class="populated place">town</span> but he moved to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="43"><span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> was like 32 kilometers from <span class="populated place">Tarezyn</span>, and with a <span class="spatial object">bus</span> it's 30 minutes away. </sentence><sentence id="44">So we very often went. </sentence><sentence id="45">My mother...like for a dress or for a hat or for something and always in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="46">And I had a happy life til 1939, til the war broked out. </sentence><sentence id="47">And in <span class="building">school</span>, they told us we have to wear masks because they were afraid for the gas. </sentence><sentence id="48">They said they will supply, you know, the...uh...with gas so I came <span class="building">home</span> from <span class="building">school</span> and the war broke out in September the Sth, 39," and my life was shattered right away because my...we were afraid they will call my father to the army. </sentence><sentence id="49">My father was only 39 years old. </sentence><sentence id="50">So my father was a very religious man. </sentence><sentence id="51">To the <span class="building">mill</span> what he possessed he had two partners. </sentence><sentence id="52">One partner which was like a relative to us and they started in <span class="building">school</span> when they  were young boys. </sentence><sentence id="53">My grandmother died when she was 28 years old. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father was 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="55">And he had a stepmother like from a book, not a good one. </sentence><sentence id="56">So he was troubling and...uh...his friend was in the same position also without a mother. </sentence><sentence id="57">So they start like to doing business about 10, 11 years. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they remained after 60 years partners like they're just relatives, and with the kids...with the children we were also like relatives til today. </sentence><sentence id="59">So my father with this partner went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to this Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="60">What the Rabbi said if he will be going to the army or should he stay in <span class="populated place">Tarczyn</span> or should he go to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="61">So the Rabbi said that he wouldn't go to the <span class="building">army</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">The Polish army doesn't need him. </sentence><sentence id="63">He's too old, 39 years old. </sentence><sentence id="64">But he should come to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">So my father came back the same day and when I came <span class="building">home</span> I...I saw that the maids are taking everything out from the <span class="interior space">closets</span> and packing in sacks, in big, long sacks. </sentence><sentence id="66">So I said, "What's this?" </sentence><sentence id="67">So my mother took me aside and she said, "Eat your supper." </sentence><sentence id="68">I still remember what the supper was. </sentence><sentence id="69">Fish, fried fish. </sentence><sentence id="70">And..uh..we're going to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="71">And right away the men came. </sentence><sentence id="72">He took all the possessions from the <span class="interior space">room</span>, from our <span class="building">house</span> and we had our own horses through the <span class="building">mill</span>, you know, so everything like...was like a...we called this a <span class="spatial object">Wagen</span>, you know, like you see in <span class="country">America</span> when the...the...the <span class="country">Mexico</span>, you know, and the horses, the big <span class="spatial object">Wagens</span>, and we took every...I mean they took everything on the <span class="spatial object">Wagen</span> and we went to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">Our family and my father's partner's family. </sentence><sentence id="74">My father stood still yet in <span class="populated place">Tarczyn</span>, but my mother and the children and the maid and we came to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was a hectic night. </sentence><sentence id="76">The kids all were crying. </sentence><sentence id="77">We were upset, and what we heard was boom, boom, boom...the artillery and the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="78">So when we came to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> we came to a beautiful <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, friends of mine parents were still....on the <span class="building">summer house</span> because it was summer in <span class="country">Europe</span> and we...this was , and we took their <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, but we didn't remain too long in this <span class="interior space">apartment</span> because the Polish army moved in...in the <span class="building">building</span> with the...you know, so we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="79">So my mother called her brother if we could come to him. </sentence><sentence id="80">So my brothers and myself and my mother came to my uncle,___---23 in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="81">Two days later my father arrived and we been together. </sentence><sentence id="82">And that day the war started and there was fires and it was hell. </sentence><sentence id="83">But we still together. </sentence><sentence id="84">Not only us because then was bombed this...uh...uh....<span class="building">house</span> on the <span class="dlf">Granichna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="85">So my father's partner came over with his family together to us, and we stood together til the German occuped <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="86">So the first day we wanted to go back to <span class="populated place">Tarczyn</span> because in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...it wasn't yet a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, but we were like, you know, just us, and we didn't have too much food because we left everything behind and what we had we left in the <span class="building">Granichna</span> and it was bombed after two days. </sentence><sentence id="87">But my father went to a baker who bought from our <span class="building">business</span> flour, and he gave us a whole, like 50 pounds, a 100 pounds of flour, and my father brought it to the...my uncle and my mother and my aunt baked <span class="spatial object">hallahs</span>, bread, so we had to eat. </sentence><sentence id="88">But was a hard time with <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">We didn't have <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">So we put on...on...for the children...for us...like for me, it was like a game you know. </sentence><sentence id="91">We were small. </sentence><sentence id="92">We didn't understand so much...on a <span class="spatial object">pot</span>, a <span class="spatial object">belt</span> to carry the water and we went to the <span class="dlf">Visla</span> (ph) for the water. </sentence><sentence id="93">It was like a half hour maybe, a hour walk but til we were loaded with water, was heavy the <span class="spatial object">pot</span>, you know, to carry. </sentence><sentence id="94">That's the way we brought the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">Till my father one day said to us...this was also September, like 15 because before 15...15 was my birthday...and I remember sitting with my mother and with everybody there from hiding from the bombs and I said, "That's my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="96">I maybe get killed from the <span class="spatial object">bombs</span>." </sentence><sentence id="97">And in the same <span class="dlf">dav</span> mv father was... went to the Rabbi with mv two brothers on the He  the whole <span class="building">building</span> came down and my father start to scream to this Rabbi, "Is this how you so holy that I am getting killed, my children and everybody?" </sentence><sentence id="98">So the Rabbi said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="99">You'll be alive and you will still see your grandchildren." </sentence><sentence id="100">And all of a sudden like a <span class="dlf">window</span> was opening in the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, and my father was out from the...from the, you know, bombed out <span class="building">house</span>, from the shrapnels, and he pulled out my brothers, the two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="101">They were injured, the face and scratches and he took and then he slipped out the Rabbi too and they came to us in the evening and the Rabbi...and we couldn't stay in my uncle's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> anymore because he lived in the <span class="interior space">third floor</span> so we went to stay in a <span class="building">store</span> in the same <span class="building">building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="102">They had a <span class="building">dairy store</span> with people. </sentence><sentence id="103">They didn't have children, two old people. </sentence><sentence id="104">So they agreed to let in this Rabbi because he needed a <span class="interior space">room</span> by himself. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was a very holy man. </sentence><sentence id="106">And we also stood there. </sentence><sentence id="107">Not only us, but practically the whole <span class="building">building</span> of people were standing like sardines because it was low for bombs so we were standing there. </sentence><sentence id="108">And then when the war was over...the war I mean the 39 the German occupied <span class="country">Poland</span>, so my father...somebody came already and said our <span class="building">mill</span> was bombed and we have nothing to go there. </sentence><sentence id="109">So my father started to the Rabbi to scream, "Where are you? </sentence><sentence id="110">What I am going to do. </sentence><sentence id="111">Everything is bombed?" </sentence><sentence id="112">And the Rabbi said, "Believe me. </sentence><sentence id="113">Not you....uh...not you <span class="building">mill</span> is...is bombed." </sentence><sentence id="114">In the same <span class="populated place">town</span> was my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="115">My mother's brother was a very rich man. </sentence><sentence id="116">He had a <span class="building">mill</span> in the same <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> what my father and actually my uncle's <span class="building">mill</span> was bombed and burned and ours was partly burned but not completely. </sentence><sentence id="117">So my mother wasn't able to go. </sentence><sentence id="118">We didn't had any communication to go back to <span class="populated place">Tarczyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">So we start to walk. </sentence><sentence id="120">Myself, my father and mine...one of mine brothers, and my father's partner and his son. </sentence><sentence id="121">I will name him Mr. Leshno and another two people. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was a distant relative of ours. </sentence><sentence id="123">He also went with his son to <span class="populated place">Tarezyn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="124">32 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="125">We maked it in a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="126">We get to come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="127">But we came near to the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">The smell was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="129">From fire, from bodies, from sweat. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was very hot. </sentence><sentence id="131">And we saw as we came to the <span class="populated place">town</span>...uh...I could...everybody could see our <span class="building">house</span>, and it was like the edge burned the <span class="building">house</span> and in behind was our <span class="building">mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="132">So we came back to the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">I opened the <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was coing we didn't susnect that we will have to run awav. </sentence><sentence id="135">So that was s00d  and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this <span class="building">house</span> from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno. </sentence><sentence id="136">They took him on the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="137">They wanted money. </sentence><sentence id="138">So my father said he has no money. </sentence><sentence id="139">He has the <span class="building">mill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">And it's after the war and I don't have money. </sentence><sentence id="141">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away. </sentence><sentence id="142">So my father was afraid to go to his <span class="interior space">room</span> but on the <span class="interior space">attic</span> a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people. </sentence><sentence id="143">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there. </sentence><sentence id="144">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive. </sentence><sentence id="145">And it was the first night in the <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="146">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too. </sentence><sentence id="147">It didn't took too long. </sentence><sentence id="148">It took about maybe 2 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="149">My father decided he's going to be free. </sentence><sentence id="150">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="151">First, they go to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and later will go to <span class="country">Russia</span> to <span class="populated place">Bialystok</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="152">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying. </sentence><sentence id="153">She screamed, "I am already a widow. </sentence><sentence id="154">How do you leave me?" </sentence><sentence id="155">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also. </sentence><sentence id="156">So we remained in the <span class="populated place">town</span> with the maid. </sentence><sentence id="157">The maid had no place where to go. </sentence><sentence id="158">It was a Jewish woman. </sentence><sentence id="159">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there. </sentence><sentence id="160">And my father disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="161">We didn't know what and where and what. </sentence><sentence id="162">Occasionally we got... mean my mother got...just had the news. </sentence><sentence id="163">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything is alright. </sentence><sentence id="164">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him." </sentence><sentence id="165">So...uh...we stood together in this <span class="populated place">Tarezyn</span>, and nothing specially, you know. </sentence><sentence id="166">We lived without... just with the hope that we will join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace. ( </sentence><sentence id="167">Sigh) Then one day what I remember, my mother said, "We're out of money and I have to go to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to Mr. Flynn. </sentence><sentence id="168">Mr. Flynn was a Polish German. </sentence><sentence id="169">That means he was a German by birth, but he lived in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he had...uh....we call it here commissioned <span class="building">bakery</span>, and he owned us a lot of money so maybe he could give us some money. </sentence><sentence id="171">So my mother left and my younger brother got very sick and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="172">I was like the woman of the <span class="building">house</span> so I called a neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="173">She was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="174">And she give him some medication and make us not cry and the maid was very good to us. </sentence><sentence id="175">And my mother went to my uncle and from my uncle they took a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and they went to this <span class="building">bakery</span>. </sentence><sentence id="176">And on the way, as they was driving on this...I don't know if they went by <span class="dlf">druska</span> we call this with two horses and a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, you know, like a <span class="spatial object">rickshaw</span>, another <span class="spatial object">rickshaw</span> met them but like back and forth and there was my father with partner and with my cousin and my...my father's partner said, "I think I see <span class="populated place">Frymet</span>." </sentence><sentence id="177">Frymet was my mother's name. </sentence><sentence id="178">So they stopped the <span class="spatial object">rickshaws</span> and my father when he...they arrived with my...with Leshno, they...they really don't have money, so they went right away to this Flynn to this...uh...man. </sentence><sentence id="179">And my mother went to him, not knowing, so actually they meet on the...met on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">What a coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="181">So this was a happiest day for us. </sentence><sentence id="182">My brother's very sick and here I have my father back and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="183">Instead we're supposed to go to my father, they came back to us because in <span class="country">Russia</span> they give us...they get them a few days to make their mind or they want to stay with them and they go to <span class="populated place">Sibiria</span> or other places in <span class="country">Russia</span> or they're going back. </sentence><sentence id="184">So it was not only for my father but all the people was like a mixup. </sentence><sentence id="185">Nobody wants to know...nobody knowed where they're going. </sentence><sentence id="186">This was my recollection as a little girl what I remembered. </sentence><sentence id="187">And...uh...my father came back and he was more calmly, wasn't afraid anymore, and he went in back to the <span class="building">mill</span> and they started to do  business again. </sentence><sentence id="188">And this...uh...German Pole from the <span class="building">bakery</span> gave him money. </sentence><sentence id="189">I mean he payed him what little by little, and we had a comfortable life. </sentence><sentence id="190">I wouldn't say no. </sentence><sentence id="191">Again I didn't have any worry as a child. </sentence><sentence id="192"><span class="building">School</span> wasn't any more for us. </sentence><sentence id="193">So my parents hired...uh... a tutor and 5, 6 children been together and we learned whatever. </sentence><sentence id="194">Wasn't much, but was enough to...to go along, you know. </sentence><sentence id="195">And then it started to be very bad and my mother was afraid that my father should go to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> to collect the money for the...so I volunteered and I went with Mr. Leshno once to <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">I carried the money and one day a German came over, not to me, to Mr. Leshno and he took him away to work. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I didn't know what to do with me, but I know what where to go. </sentence><sentence id="198">So I went to my aunt, my mother's...uh...brother. </sentence><sentence id="199">And I start to cry. </sentence><sentence id="200">They took him away and...
