<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: My name is Flora Singer, my maiden name is Mendelowitz(ph), and in the <span class="country">United States</span>, Mendelowitz(ph). </sentence><sentence id="2">I was born in Berchem(ph), which is a suburb of <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>, <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3">On August 16, 1930. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="10">My dad had a <span class="interior space">furniture workshop</span> and mom was a housekeeper, <span class="building">house</span>, homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="11">We were three small children. </sentence><sentence id="12">And we lived in what was known as a <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhood</span>, which encompassed sort of six, seven <span class="dlf">streets</span> in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">We went to <span class="building">school</span>, Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner, Saturday we went to <span class="building">synagogue</span>, but Saturday afternoon sometimes we snuck off to the movies. </sentence><sentence id="14">And life was pleasant, you know, with three sisters, sometimes we played together, other times we fought, we did homework, there was a beautiful clock at the end of our <span class="dlf">street</span>, and after <span class="building">school</span> we'd go and play there, we'd ride our <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>, we'd play ball on the <span class="dlf">wall</span> next to our <span class="building">apartment house</span> and life kind of was pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="15">It was pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="16">On the week-end, on Sundays, neighbors, friends, everybody'd get on their <span class="spatial object">bikes</span>, we'd go the <span class="dlf">park</span>, have a picnic. </sentence><sentence id="17">And the <span class="dlf">park</span> was a beautiful <span class="dlf">park</span>, it was called the Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park and had a beautiful <span class="env feature">pond</span> with swans and we enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="18">I re-visited it recently and, seems smaller than it did when I was small. </sentence><sentence id="19">And, everything seemed alright for awhile and what I didn't realize, however, was that the, there was a depression. </sentence><sentence id="20">And that my dad was having financial problems. </sentence><sentence id="21">He eventually lost his business which was, he had a <span class="building">furniture workshop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">He made custom <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">He lost it. </sentence><sentence id="24">And then went off to the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span> to get work. </sentence><sentence id="25">People tried to get work just about wherever they could. </sentence><sentence id="26">And, he even worked for the <span class="building">Fourth Company</span> for a short while. </sentence><sentence id="27">And then eventually got a position with a <span class="building">steamship company</span> and started sailing the <span class="env feature">seven seas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="28">And this was about early "36, "37. </sentence><sentence id="29">And at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="30">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="31"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that time we had gone back, we had gone, I wouldn't say back exactly, my mom did go back, but we went with my mom to <span class="country">Romania</span> because my family originated from there, and that was the last time I saw my grandfather, my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles. </sentence><sentence id="32">Most of them did perish in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">By 1937, we rarely saw my father. </sentence><sentence id="34">We always saw him like every three months, every four months, when he'd come <span class="building">home</span> for about two or three days and then would take off again. </sentence><sentence id="35">At about the same time, he made the acquaintance of an officer on his <span class="spatial object">steamship</span>, on the <span class="spatial object">steamship</span> he worked on, the man was a German and a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I'm mentioning that because he'll be coming into our lives later on again. </sentence><sentence id="37">Otherwise, I wouldn't have identified him like that. </sentence><sentence id="38">Carl would not always be able to go back to <span class="country">Germany</span> when the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> docked in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> to see his family because time was short, so he would stay with us and we became very fond of him. </sentence><sentence id="39">In 1938, there was an influx of refugees in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">They came from <span class="country">Austria</span>, from <span class="country">Germany</span> and the whole <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span> opened up their <span class="building">homes</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="41">We, ourselves, in our small <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, had four people staying with us. </sentence><sentence id="42">I think it was four, I'm not sure if it was three or four, but from what I remember, there were two couples. </sentence><sentence id="43">And around the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span> a lot of talk was going on about what went on in <span class="country">Germany</span>, about what I know now to be Chrystalnacht(ph), and I remember becoming fearful, I remember going to <span class="spatial object">bed</span> and thinking about it and I say, well, maybe we're going to have to run away. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I would ask my mother about it, and she said, don't worry, old people tell stories, they're exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="45">She says, nothing's happening, <span class="country">Austria</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, they're civilized countries. </sentence><sentence id="46">The people there are like here, she says, maybe some things are happening, after all, you know, I always tell you that there are people who are antisemetic, and who don't like Jews, but nothing like what they're telling you. </sentence><sentence id="47">So, time went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Let me just, before you go further, just ask, you said that you lived in a <span class="populated place">Jewish community</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">Did you have contact with Christian people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="93"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="94">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="95"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="97">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="98">I went to <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">I went to <span class="building">public school</span> and then after <span class="building">school</span> the boys went to what they called <span class="building">Hebrew school</span> and the little girls went to what they called <span class="building">Yiddish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="100">We learned how to read and write in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="101">Of course we had contact because in <span class="building">public school</span> it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="102">I didn't go to a secular, I mean I went to a <span class="building">secular school</span>, I didn't go to a <span class="building">religious school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, yes, we did have contact, but the reason I mentioned the <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhood</span>, is, there were Jewish people living all over <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>, but the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> that I'm speaking of was, I would almost say 90% Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="104">There were Christians living there also, but it was the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> where you had all the <span class="building">kosher butchers</span>, you had <span class="building">synagogues</span> almost on every second <span class="dlf">street</span>, and <span class="building">kosher restaurants</span>, and if you really walk those <span class="dlf">streets</span> you really didn't think there was another world. </sentence><sentence id="105">As a matter of fact, until I went to <span class="building">kindergarten</span>, I spoke just Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="106">I didn't know there were other languages, except the Hungarian and <span class="country">Rumanian</span> that I heard my parents speak, which I never learned. </sentence><sentence id="107">So, for me, until I went into regular <span class="building">public school</span>, I thought that the only people who existed were Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="108">But then, of course, I came in contact with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="109">And speaking of <span class="building">school</span>, in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in many of the <span class="country">European countries</span>, <span class="building">school</span> isn't five days a week like here in the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="110">You go to <span class="building">school</span> on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, full days. </sentence><sentence id="111">Thursday is a half day and then a half day on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, we were not excused from that, although many times, we were absent on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="113">However, when we did go to <span class="building">school</span>, our teacher would excuse us from reading, I mean from writing on the <span class="spatial object">board</span> or writing in our <span class="spatial object">notebooks</span> and then I had one teacher who sat us in the back of the <span class="interior space">room</span> so she would remember who not to call on to write. </sentence><sentence id="114">And that wasn't overly comfortable, but it was something that we adjusted to. </sentence><sentence id="115">And, okay, going back to "38, "39, there was, I remember hearing talk about <span class="country">Poland</span> being invaded and I heard talk about <span class="country">Belgium</span> being neutral, but it was very vague at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="116">It wasn't until later that I learned the full history of that. </sentence><sentence id="117">In 1940, the spring of 1940, I was at a <span class="populated place">summer camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="118">In This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="119">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="country">Belgium</span>, you had socialized medicine, you also had a system whereby poor children were offered what they called <span class="building">Fresh Air Camp</span> experience. </sentence><sentence id="121">And you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a <span class="building">Fresh Air Camp</span> to kind of be physically rehabilitated, get good food, get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy. </sentence><sentence id="122">So, I was sent to one <span class="populated place">camp</span> for two weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I remember the morning, this is very clear in my mind, the morning of May 10, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="124">We were sitting and, to the best of my recollection, having breakfast in the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>, and the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> was playing some music, the music was stopped and an announcement was made that the German armies are walking into <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="125">Which shocked the counselors, everyone, they practically jumped out of their <span class="spatial object">seats</span>. </sentence><sentence id="126">And rushed us to finish our breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="127">Took us back to the <span class="building">dorms</span>, we had to pack our little bags, they got us onto <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and took us back to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="128">I got there, I remember getting to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and I remember the <span class="dlf">streets</span> being full of people, rushing back and forth and talking. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="130">Very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="131">Almost, you know looking back on it now, is I can understand it, what happened is everybody was caught by surprise. </sentence><sentence id="132">Nobody expected it. </sentence><sentence id="133">And people were packing up <span class="spatial object">wagons</span>, and this holds true for both the Christian and the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="134">Everyone was running. </sentence><sentence id="135">Because from what I learned later on, is the Belgians were as afraid of the Germans as anybody else would be, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="136">Because during World War IL, there was a lot of resistance in <span class="country">Belgium</span> and...World War I, I'm sorry, I apologize. </sentence><sentence id="137">World War I. There was a lot of resistance in <span class="country">Belgium</span> against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="138">And, from what I heard at the time, was that the, a lot of torturing took place. </sentence><sentence id="139">So Belgians were tortured and they were frightened. </sentence><sentence id="140">I don't have, myself, any specific cases that I could document, but it's sort of one of these known facts within the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">So, everybody was running. </sentence><sentence id="142">Now, we had a slight problem. </sentence><sentence id="143">My mother and the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="144">By then, of course, remember I said my father was on a <span class="spatial object">ship</span>. </sentence><sentence id="145">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to us, my father's <span class="spatial object">ship</span> in "38, had docked in <span class="country">Canada</span> and he had a sister who lived in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection <span class="populated place">New York</span>, who had been sent there after World War I because her father had been killed on the front and there was an aunt in <span class="populated place">New York</span> who was willing to take in the little girl and raise her. </sentence><sentence id="148">So, my father called her from <span class="country">Canada</span> and she says, have you heard? </sentence><sentence id="149">This was after November of 1938, have you heard what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span>? </sentence><sentence id="150">And my father says, no, what are you talking about?She says, don't go back. </sentence><sentence id="151">He says, what do you mean, don't go back? </sentence><sentence id="152">I've got my wife, I've got the two children, I've got to go back. </sentence><sentence id="153">And she urged him to stay and she sent someone for him and they illegally brought him into the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">I shouldn't even say this, but he became legalized. </sentence><sentence id="155">He eventually entered the <span class="building">American Army</span>, served honorably and was honorably discharged. </sentence><sentence id="156">As soon as he got to <span class="populated place">New York</span> and settled down, they started making arrangements to bring us to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="157">That, they encountered great difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="158">First of all, my father wasn't here legally, as yet. </sentence><sentence id="159">Secondly, we, even if my uncle and aunt made the arrangements to bring us, we fell under the Rumanian quota. </sentence><sentence id="160">The Rumanian quota, as for most Eastern European Jews, was very long. </sentence><sentence id="161">It could sometimes take up to 10 years, waiting to come. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I came across something that was very interesting here in the <span class="country">United States</span>, in the <span class="building">immigration department</span> of the years "37 through "40, immigrants were listed by <span class="country">countries</span>, except for one group. </sentence><sentence id="163">One group was listed as Hebrews. </sentence><sentence id="164">I'll show it to you later. </sentence><sentence id="165">But, anyway, getting back to 1940. </sentence><sentence id="166">I had been sent to the <span class="populated place">summer camp</span> as did, my second sister was sent. </sentence><sentence id="167">So, two of us had been away. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was back now, the little one, the youngest was back. </sentence><sentence id="169">The middle one wasn't back yet. </sentence><sentence id="170">Now, mother tried desperately to reach the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">We didn't have a <span class="spatial object">phone</span> in our <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="172">She had to go to a <span class="building">shop</span> to get, actually, most of the <span class="spatial object">phones</span> were at the <span class="building">post office</span>, to try to call. </sentence><sentence id="173">Somehow, she couldn't get through. </sentence><sentence id="174">And had absolutely no knowledge where my middle sister was. </sentence><sentence id="175">Someone with a <span class="spatial object">car</span> and a <span class="spatial object">trundle seat</span> in the back, getting ready to escape to <span class="country">France</span>, because that's where everybody was heading, everybody was heading towards <span class="region">Northern France</span>, offered us a <span class="spatial object">seat</span> if we would just go right away. </sentence><sentence id="176">And my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mother had a terrible dilemma. </sentence><sentence id="179">Does she take two of us and go, does she wait for the third one and get stuck and lose all the children, as well? </sentence><sentence id="180">And I learned later, of course, at that time I didn't know, although she talked about it, I had a vague recollection of what she was telling me. </sentence><sentence id="181">Because I remember her saying, Florika(ph), that's a diminutive in <span class="country">Belgium</span> for Flora, we have to try to find Charlotte so we can leave. </sentence><sentence id="182">But, I remember her also saying, if I can't find her, maybe we should go anyway and see if we can find her later on. </sentence><sentence id="183">And, while she was pondering this question, which I now as a mother and a grandmother, I realize it's one of the most difficult ones you ever have to do, and I hope that no mother ever has to ponder this kind of dilemma. </sentence><sentence id="184">She kept talking, but at the same time she started packing some little bags. </sentence><sentence id="185">My youngest sister at the time had the measles and she had a high fever, which was another problem. </sentence><sentence id="186">The people who had the <span class="spatial object">car</span> kept saying, we're leaving, we're not waiting any more. </sentence><sentence id="187">And she kept begging them, wait a little while longer, maybe they'll bring my <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">Finally, they said, no, we're going. </sentence><sentence id="189">And she made a decision. </sentence><sentence id="190">She told one of the neighbors who had decided not to go, to wait out the war or whatever was coming, she says, if my Charlotte comes, please keep her for us. </sentence><sentence id="191">And we got into the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, into the <span class="spatial object">trundle seat</span> in the back, it was an open <span class="spatial object">seat</span>, and we, we went. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, it was the two of us and my mom. </sentence><sentence id="193">And her idea was that if we can get to <span class="country">France</span>, maybe to Calais(ph), and maybe get a <span class="spatial object">ship</span> to <span class="country">Britain</span>, <span class="country">Great Britain</span>, maybe from there, and she was, pure fantasy. </sentence><sentence id="194">We had no Visas, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="195">But, somehow, this is the plan that she had made. </sentence><sentence id="196">From <span class="country">Britain</span> to get to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, we went. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: We had two <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="343">They were large in my eyes, but I learned later on that they weren't quite that big. </sentence><sentence id="344">They also started feeling very heavy later on. </sentence><sentence id="345">Anyway, the <span class="spatial object">car</span> went, you couldn't go, you could walk faster than you could ride because, as I said, everybody was running. </sentence><sentence id="346">And, what I didn't learn until later on, is that we were part of the refugees that blocked the <span class="dlf">roads</span> which prevented the Allies, the Allies were the French and some of the British, from pulling back, or trying to get through on the <span class="dlf">roads</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">We, because I remember, this was after the war, I remember reading and learning about the <span class="dlf">roads</span> being blocked by refugees, and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees. </sentence><sentence id="348">The <span class="spatial object">car</span> ran out of gas, there wasn't any to be gotten, so they just, the people left the <span class="spatial object">car</span>, so we left the <span class="spatial object">car</span> and then we were on our own. </sentence><sentence id="349">We slept in the <span class="dlf">fields</span>, wherever you could just find a spot. </sentence><sentence id="350">With our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>. </sentence><sentence id="351">Or a <span class="building">barn</span> somewhere, if a farmer allowed you to stay in there. </sentence><sentence id="352">And we did, we did make it to Calais(ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="371">I remember being, we were in a <span class="building">railroad station</span>, and this was in Calais(ph), but not near the <span class="dlf">port</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">And we were, our plan was at that point, mom decided, well, maybe we shouldn't just go to the <span class="dlf">port</span> to try to get to <span class="region">Great Britain</span>, maybe we should just try to get to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, maybe that would be safer. </sentence><sentence id="373">So, we were in the <span class="building">railroad station</span>, and I remember being very tired and we had slept on our <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> in the <span class="building">station</span> and then we decided to just abandon one <span class="spatial

id="374">What's happening to my English? </sentence><sentence id="375">It's funny, when I get emotional, I lose my ability to speak. </sentence><sentence id="376">We left one <span class="spatial

this point we were okay, because we were still living in a very secular world. </sentence><sentence id="1218">But, we weren't really out, once we got to <span class="populated place">Brussels</span>, except for the few weeks that we went to <span class="building">school</span> and back to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, and just going back, we didn't really move around too much. </sentence><sentence id="1219">The only other place that we went was to a <span class="building">house</span> that was across the <span class="dlf">street</span> from the <span class="building">school</span> where mom had gotten a job working as a housekeeper. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Because by now things are getting very difficult. </sentence><sentence

id="1224">So, she cleaned the <span class="building">house</span> for these people. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And, but that, you know, things didn't last, it wasn't that, it only lasted a few weeks and then what happened is, after my, <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span>, it was the middle one, it was always <span class="populated place">Charlotte</span> for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="1226"><span class="populated place">Charlotte</span> had a fight with this child in <span class="building">school</span>, we learned that, later on, that even the instructors at the <span class="building">school</span> were worried about this child. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Because when this child said some, I'll get my brother on you, there was good reason. </sentence><sentence id="1228">Her brother was a Belgian Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Everyone in <span class="building">school</span> was afraid of her. </sentence><sentence id="1230">The

guardians, that on the Monday following this Friday, I have no date to give you here, you know, all I remember is it was a Friday, they were to report to another <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1233">To the best of my knowledge, those children reported, but never came <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I have no documentation of that.

learned. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And when mom came to <span class="building">school</span>, her first reaction was, and my reaction when the principal told me this, well, we didn't do anything, we were good, because they never called parents to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1240">See, there was no thing about <span class="building">parent-teachers association</span>, you didn't have that over there. </sentence><sentence id="1241">When a parent was called to <span class="building">school</span>, it was because a child did not behave. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So, my reaction was, well, we're good, my sisters are good, we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And she says, no, I know you didn't do anything, I want to talk to mom. </sentence><sentence id="1244">So, when, meanwhile, just prior to that, also, all that was happening within those same weeks, she realized that we didn't have really warm winter coats. </sentence><sentence id="1245">So, she had made arrangements for us to receive a winter coat and also receive a glass of milk every day. </sentence><sentence id="1246">That was like for poor children, but what we didn't know is that those winter coats and the milk came from an industrialist, Msr. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Rausank(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1248">He was the patron, we didn't have, as I said, parent-teacher associations, but what you had is patrons of the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1249">And which a rich industrialist or another wealthy individual would take a <span class="building">school</span> under their patronage and give poor children clothing, vitamins, all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="1250">So Msr. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Rausank(ph) happened to be the patron of the <span class="building">school</span>, , where we were going to. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And when mom came to <span class="building">school</span>, of course, her first reaction, too, when I told her the principal wanted to see her was, what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1253">I said, mamma, we didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1254">And I answered for my two little children because they didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1255">So, she did go to <span class="building">school</span> and the principal said, Madame , she called her, said Mrs. Fiers, I know you're Jewish and I'd like to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And mom denied up and down. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And she says, look, let's not waste time arguing, I will put you in contact with Msr. </sentence><sentence id="1258">Rausank(ph), and he, I think it's time for the
