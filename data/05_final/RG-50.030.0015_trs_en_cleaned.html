only who survived the Holocaust, and they all had many, many children because that was the way of life in that time. </sentence><sentence id="15">And...uh...she was already...uh...an older person when she met my....my father who came from <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> and she accepted to...to marry him after refusing many, many suitors. </sentence><sentence id="16">And...uh...they lived in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span> for one year...uh...where my brother was born in 1924, in July 26, 1924. </sentence><sentence id="17">And after the...they stayed uncast.

was gone, they came to <span class="country">Belgium</span> where I was born the 24th of July 1927. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh... grew up there, and we lived...uh...nicely. </sentence><sentence id="21">My father and my mother...in the beginning were working in the <span class="building">diamonds business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">She was a Schleifer which means she was, I don't know how to say that in English...she...they were...he...she was not a cutter. </sentence><sentence id="23">A Schleifer is what a polisher...a diamond polisher and...uh...little by little my father became...uh...courtier. </sentence><sentence id="24">Is that an English word? </sentence><sentence id="25"><span class="building">Courtier</span>? </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh...He was selling for other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier and...uh...I was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my first language was French so I went to <span class="building">grammar school</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span> and on Wednesday afternoon and Sunday morning I went to <span class="building">Jewish school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">My brother went to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> for...uh...the whole day where he learned Hebrew and Jewish and...uh...French and Flemish. </sentence><sentence id="28">Uh...in..in 1940 when I finished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I came to <span class="country">American</span>. </sentence><sentence id="29">To tell you the story why we came to <span class="country">America</span> is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in <span class="country">America</span> in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="30">They came, I think, after the First World War here with all the children but my grandmother was already married in...uh...in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span> so she was...uh...I think she was the oldest daughter. </sentence><sentence id="31">So she remained with her husband and her children there in <span class="country">Czechoslovakia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">This is why I have...uh...in reality I am a third generation already American because... uh...my family is here. </sentence><sentence id="33">So my father came here to <span class="country">America</span> to...for the question of the inheritance. </sentence><sentence id="34">And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="35">His cousins, his uncles...uh...it was...uh...very happy situation for him. </sentence><sentence id="36">So he wanted to immigrate. </sentence><sentence id="37">And we immigrated really to <span class="country">America</span> in September of 37. </sentence><sentence id="38">For me as a child it was a shock because it was in the depression era and...uh...we lived in the <span class="region">low east side</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="40">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="41"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We...compared to what...how we lived in <span class="populated place">New York</span> or...in <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>, was a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="42">It was a misery compared to that. </sentence><sentence id="43">And...uh...although I...I loved to be with all these cousins that I didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me to <span class="building">school</span>...uh...as a....with the beginners. </sentence><sentence id="44">I was already 10 at the time and it was very hard for me because I didn't spoke the language. </sentence><sentence id="45">My brother, who was three years older, and finished already <span class="building">grammar school</span>, immediately entered to <span class="building">high school</span> and instead to be in the sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent him immediately in the third grade. </sentence><sentence id="46">I don't know to compare that with the American. </sentence><sentence id="47">So he was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="48">I was very unhappy here, and I cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very difficult time at that time with the depression and my...my mother and father had a lot of difficulties making out. </sentence><sentence id="49">So we came to the conclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for my father if we send...we went back...uh...to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and...uh...this is what they decided to do. </sentence><sentence id="50">We went...me and my brother and my mother, we went back to <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span> and my father stayed here in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="51">My mother was from...uh...the...from <span class="region">Galicia</span>, and she spoke a beautiful Polish and beautiful German and she was great admir... admirer of...uh...of German poetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German Lieders to me, so I... never studied German, but I do speak and I do understand it. </sentence><sentence id="52">And...uh... she never believed that...uh....German with their culture could do anything to the Jews she said. </sentence><sentence id="53">Although we saw all the people coming from <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1939, she said...but...it's not so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="54">My father was very scared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to <span class="country">America</span> in September of 39. </sentence><sentence id="55">And my mother refused to go back to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="56">She said, "Not back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="57">You come back to...to <span class="country">Europe</span>." </sentence><sentence id="58">My father said, "No," so he stayed in <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="59">So unfortunately because of this..-uh...dispute between them we stayed in <span class="country">Belgium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh...The German invaded <span class="country">Belgium</span> in the beginning of May. </sentence><sentence id="61">I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I cannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my mother decided we cannot stay. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh...It was the war. </sentence><sentence id="63">So we took some of our possessions and we took the <span class="spatial
