<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: I was literally the last one. </sentence><sentence id="334">What I was getting at is the soccer teams were chosen either by height or in turn. </sentence><sentence id="335">And I was number 11 or number 12 in size and when the teams were chosen, I was also chosen, something like 11" or 12"". </sentence><sentence id="336">That's significant. </sentence><sentence id="337">There are 11 soccer players to a side. </sentence><sentence id="338">But the point I'm getting at is there were two guys who basically deliberately followed me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="339">And the teacher, alias umpire, didn't see it. </sentence><sentence id="340">Again, trivial but you were asking for examples and those are the only -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Did you really see it or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Oh, no, no ignored it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
