<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Uh in their case they uh heard about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> from a friend, who suggested it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="35">My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a place where they would be safe--my mother being particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew. </sentence><sentence id="36">And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their collaborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews. </sentence><sentence id="37">So my mother was particularly vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="38">Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for <span class="region">Nazi-occupied Europe</span>. </sentence><sentence id="39">Uh, and this friend uh suggested <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="40">He...he knew the place; and my father went there and found a <span class="interior space">room</span> to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother. </sentence><sentence id="41">And they came on a little <span class="spatial object">steam engine train</span> that uh brought many Jews there, as we know. </sentence><sentence id="42">And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also mention that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> was exactly for me the right doctor in the right place. </sentence><sentence id="43">Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Albert Schweitzer in <span class="country">Africa</span>, dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a reputation as a bit of a medical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the <span class="region">area</span> to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazis--and had a special stake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into the world. </sentence><sentence id="44">I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern <span class="building">American facility</span> today. </sentence><sentence id="45">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="46">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="47"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: So you were, or your mother was, brought to this <span class="populated place">town</span> in the <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="65">Where...where...the <span class="interior space">room</span> that your parents rented, uh from whom did they rent it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: They rented it from a peasant couple in a uh little <span class="populated place">hamlet</span> which is a part of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span> called <span class="populated place">La Fayolle</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="67">| Uh, I was known as the baby that used to wake up the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh, they uh...uh, well as I mentioned in my film, "Weapons of the Spirit," I...I...my parents didn't remain in touch, actually, with the farmers who rented that <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="69">But I tracked them down. </sentence><sentence id="70">And the widow of the farmer who did rent the <span class="interior space">room</span> is in my film. </sentence><sentence id="71">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="79">Where...where did your parents go after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: They went to uh <span class="populated place">Saint-Etienne</span> for a year--which is not far from <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>--where my father was a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="83">My father was already a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="84">He had been a journalist before the war. </sentence><sentence id="85">And then to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Let's stay a minute [in] <span class="populated place">Saint-Etienne</span> for that year. </sentence><sentence id="91">Uh, they were in <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, in the area of <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, for how long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: They were there from the fall of 1943 "til the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="95">I don't know exactly when they leave, come to think of it... when they left, come to think of it. </sentence><sentence id="96">But it...I think it was around uh August of "44. </sentence><sentence id="97">Something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: You talk, obviously, a lot about this in your film. </sentence><sentence id="103">Uh, but for the purposes of this interview, would you tell me more about the people with whom your parents came in contact, as they </sentence></p></dialogue>

It's complicated, because there...there are presuppositions in the question that I have to actually address. </sentence><sentence id="113">That's the uh... I was not raised with stories about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, I was uh not raised with stories about the war, with stories about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="115">I was raised by parents who wanted to put all that behind them. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, much of what I've come to know about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>--although I've since spoken quite a bit about my parents, and I've gotten certainly information that is relevant. </sentence><sentence id="117">Uh, but it's not uh...a lot of my information is really information that I got as an adult, uh talking to people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="125">Then we'll do this, as it were, at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="128">And let's talk about uh... And we'll talk about <span class="populated place">Le Chambon</span>, as such, at the end. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh tell me where your parents went. </sentence><sentence id="130">They went to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, you said. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh, what did they do there and for how long were they there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: Well, they were there "til uh after the war. </sentence><sentence id="133">They were "til 1948, when they came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="134">Uh, my father, among other things, edited a uh <span class="building">intellectual weekly</span> called "[La Rue (ph)]," which was uh quite prominent, had very prestigious uh writers--uh, including uh Sartre, Camus, and Raymond [Quenot (ph)]--and people like that contributed articles to it. </sentence><sentence id="135">But uh it was a very difficult time to launch a...a publication and there were all sorts of restrictions, including paper restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="136">And uh ultimately it had to fold after about ten or twelve issues. </sentence><sentence id="137">And uh my father uh had to find work; and ultimately he decided to go to <span class="country">America</span>, and went to <span class="populated place">New York</span> where he shortly thereafter became the correspondent of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="138">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="139"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 5 Le Figaro--a French daily--which he was for twenty-five years. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, [he was] also writing a number of books and also uh contributing to a number of other publications. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Going back to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, uh by the time you left <span class="populated place">Paris</span> or were about to leave <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, you would be four years--or close to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Do you remember anything about <span class="populated place">Paris</span> as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Oh, I think I have a few uh memories that must go back to that time. </sentence><sentence id="159">But I'm really stunned by how much difficulty I have remembering much of my childhood; and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised with memory being uh bad. </sentence><sentence id="160">Uh, I was discouraged from...from remembering. </sentence><sentence id="161">I was discouraged from asking questions. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember. </sentence><sentence id="163">And maybe that's what's given me a...a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory. </sentence><sentence id="164">Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do. </sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, so I remember uh startling little. </sentence><sentence id="166">In fact, the most startling thing I...I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to <span class="country">America</span>, and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I cannot remember ever... cannot remember the experience of having been in a <span class="region">foreign land</span> and not speaking the language. </sentence><sentence id="168">I have absolutely no recollection of it. </sentence><sentence id="169">And that, to me--and...and I can't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it. </sentence><sentence id="170">I cannot remember it. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I realize that four is already not, you know, it's not a baby anymore. </sentence><sentence id="172">So uh I...1 do view myself as a...as a product of a uh...of a traumatized childhood. </sentence><sentence id="173">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="174">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="175"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Well, let's talk about that, and talk more about that. </sentence><sentence id="196">Uh, when you came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>, uh what do you remember about those yearly, early years and in <span class="populated place">New York</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Very little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Very little, very little. </sentence><sentence id="208">Uh, as I get older I remember more, of course. </sentence><sentence id="209">But uh I...uh I think that the fact that uh my parents withheld from me vital information as to my identity-- as to who they were, as to why we were there, as to uh why they were who they were--uh really uh confused all my...all normal relationships with the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Who did you believe your parents were? </sentence><sentence id="214">How did... They were in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="215">You were with them. </sentence><sentence id="216">You had no memory of before. </sentence><sentence id="217">Did you believe you were Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="224">I knew that uh... No. </sentence><sentence id="225">In fact, I was raised very French. </sentence><sentence id="226">Uh, the uh...1...1 now believe that part of the reason I was raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, I went to a <span class="building">French school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">We spoke French at <span class="building">home</span>; although I shouldn't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="229">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="230"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 7 overstate that, because there was also my...my mother. </sentence><sentence id="231">Even though she was originally from <span class="country">Poland</span> had a great love of <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during the war, too. </sentence><sentence id="233">She was able successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman. </sentence><sentence id="234">I have uh come from a family with great linguistic skills. </sentence><sentence id="235">Uh, my sister later became an actress in <span class="country">Mexico</span>, uh playing Mexicans on the <span class="spatial object">screen</span>, you know. </sentence><sentence id="236">And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing more difficult than that. </sentence><sentence id="237">So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through. </sentence><sentence id="238">Uh no, but we...I didn't...I knew we weren't Americans. </sentence><sentence id="239">I knew that we were...we were uh... In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewish, we...I always knew we were different. </sentence><sentence id="240">We were foreign. </sentence><sentence id="241">It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth. </sentence><sentence id="242">If they had been people who completely assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person. </sentence><sentence id="243">They never did. </sentence><sentence id="244">Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I...they never really identified them[selves] as immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="245">I always had the feeling in the back of my mind that one day we would go back to <span class="country">France</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">My father was a correspondent. </sentence><sentence id="247">You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final move. </sentence><sentence id="248">I never viewed them as like part of the, you know, immigrant flow into <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">Uh, very strange. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: What about religion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Uh, no religion. </sentence><sentence id="282">Uh I remember we...uh I was what might be called a "nothing." </sentence><sentence id="283">In other words, when I'd ask my parents, "What...what are we?," </sentence><sentence id="284">they'd say, "We're nothing." </sentence><sentence id="285">And then they would move on; try to, you know, dismiss...dismiss the question. </sentence><sentence id="286">Uh, not long ago my sister mentioned, by the way, that she was not the only "nothing" in her class. </sentence><sentence id="287">Uh, you know, there...there are people who...who find themselves in... in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="288">Uh, but no. </sentence><sentence id="289">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="290">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="291"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 8 We were not...we were not Christians. </sentence><sentence id="292">I never assumed that, although it was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="293">I guess I assumed that uh... (Pause) I guess I must have assumed that we were uh, you know, originally Christian; but my father was violently anti-religious, as was my mother, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="294">And uh that meant nothing. </sentence><sentence id="295">I mean, there was nothing Christian about us. </sentence><sentence id="296">Uh we were nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: How did it feel to be a nothing, to be of no religion and no place ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Well, at the time uh I thought that was fine; or I...I thought ...I thought that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="317">Uh, I've come to feel very differently about that. </sentence><sentence id="318">But that's uh...I uh, you know, people often uh ask me--since I've mentioned the fact that I only learned I was Jewish when I was eighteen-- uh, "How did it...2" And what happened is that my parents sat me down and told me. </sentence><sentence id="319">I was about to go off to <span class="populated place">Paris</span> to study, and uh was going to be staying with a cousin of mine, uh who happens to be a survivor of <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="320">To compound the irony, a rather prominent gentlemen at that, Samuel [Pisar (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="321">And uh people will sometimes say, "Well, was it a real shock?" </sentence><sentence id="322">You know, "How did you react?" </sentence><sentence id="323">And L..they're surprised that it --I don't even remember exactly how I reacted. </sentence><sentence id="324">And basically the information never really got through to me, but the facts got through to me. </sentence><sentence id="325">But when you are raised with taboos, the taboos are so internalized that you don't fully absorb the information even when it is given to you. </sentence><sentence id="326">You...your...your filtering mechanisms keep working. </sentence><sentence id="327">Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were, part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family. </sentence><sentence id="328">Uh, it was a great...except for a few members who joined in this conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret from the children. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in <span class="populated place">New York</span> whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="330">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="331"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 9 being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="332">And now as I reconnect with those family members, I still...there's a part of me that finds it very difficult to absorb their identities and their names. </sentence><sentence id="333">It's like I...I'm...I still feel this is information I'm not supposed to have, and I have to fight to to have it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: When did you start... Let's keep going with this. </sentence><sentence id="355">When... when you went uh to your...your relative uh Samuel [Pisar (ph)], what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="356">Did the information become a little more internalized for you? </sentence><sentence id="357">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: No, it really didn't. </sentence><sentence id="363">It really didn't. </sentence><sentence id="364">It took a long time. </sentence><sentence id="365">And uh I was in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> ten years, and I had no interest in...in any of this. </sentence><sentence id="366">Uh..-uh Sam at the time was uh uh...(pause) like many survivors, uh concerned with building his life; and he's an ambitious man. </sentence><sentence id="367">And focusing on...on that, uh although he would he would tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="368">I think the...the main effect of that was he...he...he... Although he doesn't really remember it, uh he...he did tell me stories about the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and about his experiences. </sentence><sentence id="369">And uh they had a profound effect on me. </sentence><sentence id="370">Uh but I still didn't really...1 couldn't even...I'm not sure I could define what it was. </sentence><sentence id="371">L...I still...No, I didn't uh...uh I had no Jewish identity when I was in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="372">None. </sentence><sentence id="373">Uh, and no Jewish involvements. </sentence><sentence id="374">And uh...uh L...that really only started...
