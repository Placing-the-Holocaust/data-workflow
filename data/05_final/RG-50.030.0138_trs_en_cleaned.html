<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Masha Loen. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, 1930. </sentence><sentence id="7">I lived near <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> in a <span class="populated place">suburb</span> called <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="8">I came from an average <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="9">In Yiddish they would say <span class="building">Balle Batish</span>, middle class. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was a good tailor, maybe would have called a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older sister than I am. </sentence><sentence id="11">We were four girls. </sentence><sentence id="12">One of them was born in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="13">There was only three girls before the war, and no boys. </sentence><sentence id="14">And what I can tell about my childhood...I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="15">I went to <span class="building">private school</span>, called <span class="building">Kommerz Gymnasium</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="16">I was thrown out of <span class="building">public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="17">It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said something to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the <span class="spatial object">desk</span>. </sentence><sentence id="18">On accident I think it hit her nose. </sentence><sentence id="19">So my grandfather pushed me into a <span class="building">private school</span> somehow and I enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="20">I went to <span class="building">school</span> everyday by <span class="spatial object">bus</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">We came back. </sentence><sentence id="22">We came back <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="23">We played games. </sentence><sentence id="24">We played <span class="spatial object">soccer ball</span> they called in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and we made Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating. </sentence><sentence id="25">That was the main sport of <span class="country">Lithuania</span> in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything was going on just as it is till 1940, when the Russians came in first to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="26">They gave us <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>, the <span class="populated place">capital</span> back and at that time when I was in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, a lot...we had some refugees from <span class="country">Austria</span> and from <span class="country">Poland</span> that had relatives in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> so they came and we helped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the name of Levine, Anna Levine. </sentence><sentence id="27">I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="28">My grandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a <span class="spatial object">bicyclet</span>, you know, a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> for my girlfriend Anna. </sentence><sentence id="29">He said you know, <span class="building">Maraska</span> (ph), I can't afford to buy her a new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> and put on a <span class="spatial object">net</span> in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and she was a beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="30">A very well-behaved child. </sentence><sentence id="31">My mother loved her very much because she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="32">I absolute don't know. </sentence><sentence id="33">I lost touch with her when I went into <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because I had so much on my mind. </sentence><sentence id="34">When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that is four and a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she said run, 01:04: because I'm running. </sentence><sentence id="35">And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we ran. </sentence><sentence id="36">My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven years younger than I am and we start running and before we even reached about twenty, thirty kilometers...the Germans were ahead of us, and my grandmother was running and my uncle was running, and my uncle at one time was living in <span class="populated place">Memel</span> that was occupied by the Germans and he came back to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and he said, we have to get away. </sentence><sentence id="37">We cannot stay. </sentence><sentence id="38">So we were running, but the running didn't help. </sentence><sentence id="39">They overtook us, so we snuck  very quietly back into <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and I lived in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span> and what I can tell you is it it happened to me I an experience today that with that . </sentence><sentence id="40">I, we walked into our <span class="building">home</span> and everything was like blood lying all over the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="41">Nobody was killed because nobody was in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="42">I don't know how the blood get got there and then the neighbors all around the <span class="populated place">district</span>... many many Jews got killed. </sentence><sentence id="43">In fact later on I heard from the grown-ups accidentally there was there was a head from the child and a breast from the mother standing on a <span class="spatial object">piano</span> because the Lithuanians said the pogrom before the Germans even came in, and today of all days I met a righteous Lithuanian woman and admired her more than anybody else that from so many murderers like the Lithuanians, one woman could come out and hide a one and a half year old child. </sentence><sentence id="44">I don't know if she got paid for it or what happened. </sentence><sentence id="45">I didn't want to ask questions but I did ask her and I feel badly. </sentence><sentence id="46">Maybe I hurt her, if she had more problems from her neighbors than from the Nazis, because the Lithuanians, like I said, were very very bad. </sentence><sentence id="47">They collaborated with the Germans in every way and did a lot of things that the Germans didn't do and asked them to do to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">To find one that saved really a child is a miracle and I shouldn't have said it. </sentence><sentence id="49">I felt badly later on, because she answered, in every nationality and every religion are different kind of people. </sentence><sentence id="50">I wanted to tell her yes, but not so in Lithuanian but I already kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything because it happened as they said...there was the <span class="populated place">Riga</span> Aktion, there was the <span class="country">Estonia</span> Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="51">Every time they took out...first they killed a lot of...the first thing they killed is the intellectuals in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="52">So being a child I didn't know that, learned after the war, but what I remember is the <span class="populated place">Riga</span> Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="53">I was working, as an older child. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was always acting like...when the war started I was not going on eleven...I was going on forty, because I had to grow up. </sentence><sentence id="55">I had to grow up because of the blood that they saw and the thing that was going on and here is my mother with two...with pregnant, expecting another child and I didn't know, you know, in which world Iam. </sentence><sentence id="56">Am I forty?Am | eleven? </sentence><sentence id="57">Am I fifteen? </sentence><sentence id="58">Sometimes I cried like a baby and sometimes I acted like a grown-up that nobody can touch me. </sentence><sentence id="59">I was untouchable, and what happened is is that my uncle, Menashke Saposhnikov, my father's brother, was one of the leaders of the underground and when the <span class="populated place">Riga</span> ghet...and we had a <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">It was in my grandfather's <span class="building">home</span> that you went through a <span class="spatial object">baker's oven</span> and you went in there. </sentence><sentence id="61">In fact the underground some of their <span class="spatial object">equipment</span> kept in that <span class="building">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="62">They knew about the Kinder Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="63">I walked at night in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> <span class="building">Werkstatten</span>, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, you know, what they did knitting and they did sewing and all different kind of things and they came to pick me up to run me into the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> because they knew somehow, the <span class="interior space">underground</span> knew there was going to be an Aktion and they are taking people to <span class="populated place">Riga</span>. </sentence><sentence id="64">And as we get, as there was an Aktion...first it was the...no, I'm sorry, I have to go back...first there was the the Kleine Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="65">That was from the small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">There was a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> and they liquidated the small <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="67">Then there was the aktion from one <span class="region">section</span> where I lived and that time they took away my grandfather...both my grandfathers, both my grandmothers, uncles, aunts and so on and I tell you something - I could have saved them, but I came too late. </sentence><sentence id="68">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="69">The <span class="building">Kommandatur</span>, the German command was not far from us and I had a little cousin...my uncle and aunt live now in <span class="populated place">Vilna</span>...it was their daughter,Dveirele, and she came in and she said: Tante Michle...German...poup, poup, poup. </sentence><sentence id="70">She saw those German near the <span class="building">Kommandatur</span>, and she saw them with their rifles,  whatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you know, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was scrubbing the <span class="interior space">floor</span>, and said get out 01:10: of my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the shotguns and pushed us out of the <span class="building">house</span> and at that time my father, like I said, he was a better tailor...worked for <span class="country">Jordan</span> of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...at that time he was the head of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the Lebensschein. </sentence><sentence id="71">And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> in a little <span class="spatial object">basket</span> and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the Lebensschein. </sentence><sentence id="72">So I ran into the <span class="building">house</span> and I grabbed the Schein and I come out and my mother wasn't there, and then there was a big <span class="dlf">street</span> that they took us to the <span class="dlf">field</span> and that <span class="dlf">street</span> was the <span class="dlf">border</span> how many people they took out, and there were people going by the dozens, carrying children and so on, and I want my mother, so I stand up in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I start yelling...this is why I tell you I grew up so fast...Momma, Momma, Momma...so a German start beating me and he said get off the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="73">I'll shoot you right there. </sentence><sentence id="74">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="75">I have Judenschein. </sentence><sentence id="76">You cannot shoot me, like I was something special. </sentence><sentence id="77">I thought I was something special. </sentence><sentence id="78">He says get off there and all of a sudden from about I don't know how many feet away to tell you...maybe a block away...I heard my mother's voice yelling Maruska, Maruska...and I run to her. </sentence><sentence id="79">When we came to that <span class="dlf">field</span> where they're they're separating...right, left, right, left...1 found out that one Judenschein can save one family, and I had four of them, because I had three from us and one for my father that was out to work in the <span class="building">brigade</span>, so I kept running around between the people, but they already took away both my grandmothers and both my grandfathers. </sentence><sentence id="80">There were nobody left from my family that was living right there in that <span class="region">section</span>, so what I did is I said Momma, what should I do. </sentence><sentence id="81">She said start grabbing people. </sentence><sentence id="82">Start giving them the Judenschein. </sentence><sentence id="83">My mother always thought of somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="84">She was a beautiful lady, not because she was my mother, but as I grow up and I don't think I'm that nice and people say I'm a nice person but I don't think so, because I don't, wouldn't have had the guts to tell my daughter to run around with life, life depends on and start grabbing people and giving them Judenschein and then you don't even know if you would get it back from them, but if people were nice enough when we came back on the right side, on the good side, they did give me back the Judenschein and this is one day part of my life, of my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="85">And that was the first aktion...that was the second one and then it was the <span class="populated place">Riga</span> aktion. </sentence><sentence id="86">I couldn't tell you really one after another because I blank out or I may go back from time to time to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="87">Is that alright? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: That's fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: And then came the big Aktion, October 28th, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="177">It was...I don't know...I can't tell you dates really and that  was called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion. </sentence><sentence id="178">And they went from <span class="building">home</span> to <span class="building">home</span> and they told everybody please leave your sick ones at <span class="building">home</span> and <span class="country">Jordan</span> wants to hold a speech. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">We want you on this and this <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">Leave your sick ones <span class="building">home</span> and everybody has to be at this and this time on that <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that my aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on his face and we didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="182">He came with us. </sentence><sentence id="183">Some of my aunts were separated. </sentence><sentence id="184">My mother's sister that we lived in the same <span class="building">house</span> was separated from us, but my father's brother and my father's brother that was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> kept yelling at my father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and he worked with him in the <span class="building">Jordan Brigade</span> as a tailor, so we came and we came on that big <span class="dlf">field</span> and they start sorting and <span class="country">Jordan</span> never showed up. </sentence><sentence id="185">They surrounded us with machine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left. </sentence><sentence id="186">And Hessel, I think it was Hessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="187">He was the right hand of <span class="country">Jordan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother tailor. </sentence><sentence id="189">Take your family and go. </sentence><sentence id="190">So my father started looking for people...you know for family, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him. </sentence><sentence id="191">He says oh, he had a toothache. </sentence><sentence id="192">It will be pulled out, and my father saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were behind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll never forget...and they said all this is your family? </sentence><sentence id="193">And my father saved a lot of strangers and we all went and a lot of my aunts went away. </sentence><sentence id="194">A lot of people went away to the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span>, and what the most terrible thing about the <span class="building">Ninth Fort</span> or the <span class="building">Seventh Fort</span> was in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> is that at night we heard the shooting of the people. </sentence><sentence id="195">The machine guns were going "t-t-t-t-t-t-t" and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now I found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the <span class="dlf">grave</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">They were shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open <span class="dlf">graves</span> and then they would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten thousand people to shoot into the <span class="dlf">graves</span>, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and everything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them. </sentence><sentence id="197">Some of them got themselves out and came back into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what they called <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in <span class="populated place">Sobibor</span> and they called <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in other <span class="populated place">death camps</span>...that why when I talk about the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> I don't talk it as a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="198">I talk it as the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">I talk about <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> as the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, because we did have portable <span class="building">crematoriums</span> in the <span class="populated place">Ninth Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">We did have <span class="building">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="populated place">Seventh Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">They didn't have to have the <span class="spatial object">oven</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">They just shot them in. </sentence><sentence id="203">At that time they still had bullets. </sentence><sentence id="204">They shot them in and then burned them. </sentence><sentence id="205">So if they can call a <span class="building">portable crematorium</span> why couldn't we call the <span class="building">portable crematorium</span> on the <span class="populated place">Ninth Fort</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">Do you think I'm wrong? </sentence><sentence id="207">So this is what I call...when I talk to some people where they ask me about experiences, I don't talk really like a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> is a concentration of certain people that, ethnic people and so on, and I don't call this a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> because being without food, being without clothes, being eliminated constantly, thousand, ten thousand, five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a  portable <span class="building">crematorium</span>...you couldn't call this a <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">You called this a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, and then we were sent to the <span class="populated place">death camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">Now I want to tell you one story that I always talk about and that's the children aktion. </sentence><sentence id="210">The children...1 was working in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in <span class="populated place">Washington</span> with a broken leg, but that's alright. </sentence><sentence id="211">Everything happens that should happen. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="212">I came to my father. </sentence><sentence id="213">You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the <span class="building">ghetto works</span> and my father was working in <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">You know, you would trade some things for some food and the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and would share. </sentence><sentence id="215">My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us. </sentence><sentence id="216">My father shared it with his family. </sentence><sentence id="217">So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, they had a separate <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">They had a <span class="dlf">window</span> into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and everything was...they had it better than anybody. </sentence><sentence id="219">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works but it still was not in to <span class="populated place">town</span>, so that day in, very early in the morning, there's a . </sentence><sentence id="220">You know what...I would like to go out into <span class="populated place">town</span>, in a <span class="building">brigade</span> I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point that the kids are starving, you know. </sentence><sentence id="221">And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know, we did our best. </sentence><sentence id="222">And he said you know what...I said you have protection. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="223">You go in. </sentence><sentence id="224">You talk to the <span class="building">Arbeitsamt</span>, to the <span class="building">Komitet</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, so he went in and it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know, Herr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a <span class="building">house</span>...would you daughter be happy to do that? </sentence><sentence id="225">He said my daughter would be very happy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works...we saw some <span class="spatial object">black machines</span> coming into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> but no <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">Just painted little white <span class="dlf">windows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny. </sentence><sentence id="228">There's something rotten in <span class="populated place">Den</span>...I didn't know about <span class="country">Denmark</span>...I was too young to know about, you know, <span class="populated place">Hamlet</span> or whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="229">Why are those <span class="spatial object">machines</span> coming in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="230">I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some people maybe from a different <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> or something, so I kept quiet and we went to the German's <span class="building">house</span>, and we cleaned up the <span class="building">house</span> and there were six girls and we were six girls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier, the Jewish fellow that went with us, so there was no way of us going out into the <span class="populated place">town</span> and trade something for bread or milk or things like that, so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean up a <span class="building">house</span>, as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything. </sentence><sentence id="231">Still it doesn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="232">Six girls. </sentence><sentence id="233">So what we did is we didn't know what to do...we start dancing and singing and dancing the horah and | never danced the horah in my life, but it was some older people and they knew about the horah and they start dancing the horah so the Germans walk in and said, you're through? </sentence><sentence id="234">It's time to take you back. </sentence><sentence id="235">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="236">We couldn't trade anyways so something to bring in to <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so they took us back and that Lithuanian woman was wrong when she said every <span class="country">nation</span> or anything. </sentence><sentence id="237">When we came to the <span class="dlf">ghetto gate</span>, there was like a Lithuanian with a gun, a machine gun on one part and a German about maybe like from here to the <span class="spatial object">vase</span> here with another machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="238">A Lithuanian and a German, and the whole thing, the whole <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was surrounded and we walk into the <span class="dlf">ghetto gate</span> and there is none of our Jewish policemen. </sentence><sentence id="239">There is none of the  same German when we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="240">There was different Germans, completely different, and something is very quiet on that <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> isn't moving. </sentence><sentence id="242">Everything was like in slow motion. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I and a man that was with the <span class="building">Arbeitsamt</span>, the uncle Jankele Goldovsky comes out from behind that <span class="building">booth</span> near the <span class="dlf">gate</span> where the Germans were standing. </sentence><sentence id="244">He said, girls, you came at the worst time. </sentence><sentence id="245">It's twelve-thirty. </sentence><sentence id="246">They are taking away all children, all people over forty-five, fifty he says, and they don't have the quota. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="247">They're taking everybody. </sentence><sentence id="248">And as we walk out from that <span class="building">booth</span>, we saw about four White Russians, Germans, coming with machine guns...started, it was a very very long <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">It went through, all through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, that <span class="dlf">street</span> where the, where the <span class="dlf">gate</span> was. </sentence><sentence id="250">And they surrounded us. </sentence><sentence id="251">They surrounded us and they start walking with us and I know I walked by that little <span class="building">Kommandatur</span>, our little <span class="building">houses</span>, and I know...oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="252">My mother is at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">Even now I get goose pimple even if I talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="254">My mother is at <span class="building">home</span> with the two kids. </sentence><sentence id="255">What can I do? </sentence><sentence id="256">Shall I run? </sentence><sentence id="257">Shall I make a run for it? </sentence><sentence id="258">Go see what happened? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="259">And from far away I saw a friend of mine, Susa, with her mother, standing outside a <span class="dlf">door</span>, and I couldn't do nothing and I start giggling. </sentence><sentence id="260">I didn't know what happened to me, and the , the German, he says to me, ah, laugh...in German...laugh as much as you want. </sentence><sentence id="261">In a half an hour the <span class="env feature">sun</span> will not shine for you anymore. </sentence><sentence id="262">And I walked. </sentence><sentence id="263">We walked and they take us to this...and there were some big, big <span class="building">apartment houses</span> in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> on that <span class="dlf">street</span>, and they walk us to those <span class="spatial object">machines</span> that I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="264">They tried to put us into <span class="spatial object">machine</span> and one girl practically had one foot up on it, and there was a man...I'll never forget him - Regal (ph) was his name, a German man. </sentence><sentence id="265">He had his hand in a sling and it's his <span class="building">house</span> that we cleaned and he says, ah, nein, no. </sentence><sentence id="266">These girls belong to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works. </sentence><sentence id="267">Take them back. </sentence><sentence id="268">He saw us from <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, where all the Germans were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="269">He recognized one of the girls. </sentence><sentence id="270">I don't know what he did, and we got four people, four German again...different ones. </sentence><sentence id="271">They took us back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works, and what I tell you is the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works....there are two <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">One on one side or like <span class="building">barracks</span> or like places that work, and one on the other side and in the middle was like a big, big <span class="dlf">street</span>, and we walked to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works and we walk in. </sentence><sentence id="273">No Jewish policemen. </sentence><sentence id="274">Not the same Germans. </sentence><sentence id="275">Completely new people, and they walk us into one of the places and I see some dead bodies, not lying on the...in between the two <span class="building">barracks</span>, and some guy that I fix a sweater for him - I thought he was, you know, war, how do you call it - prisoner of war, all of a sudden is wearing a German uniform with a with a machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="276">And we walk in to that <span class="interior space">room</span> and everybody from the people, all the people asking what is happening in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, what is happening in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="277">I said, because they had no <span class="dlf">windows</span> out into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and I said, we don't know what's happening in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">What's happening here? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="279">All we know is that somebody told us they are taking away...they didn't say we know...they're taking away all the children, old people over a certain age, and anybody that's sick - they're taking them away. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I know my father's on the other side, and I know my mother's <span class="building">home</span> with the two kids, my two little sisters, and I didn't know what to do, and I came to him and he said, oh my, Maruska, he says, come on - I'll take you to your father. </sentence><sentence id="281">And the women that were friends of my mother and my brother are dragging me back. </sentence><sentence id="282">She says don't go. </sentence><sentence id="283">The minute somebody walks out or he beats them up or he shoots them. </sentence><sentence id="284">I said but I have to go to see my father, I said. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I fixed him - I told you I fixed him a sweater for him and I was very good to him and he says, Maruska, tell me. </sentence><sentence id="286">I  know you have two little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="287">Tell me where they are. </sentence><sentence id="288">I'll go and help you. </sentence><sentence id="289">And you know, sometimes I was eleven but sometimes like I told you I was forty, and my mind start working. </sentence><sentence id="290">I said oh no. </sentence><sentence id="291">He's wearing a German uniform. </sentence><sentence id="292">He's having a gun. </sentence><sentence id="293">Even if I I tell him one word...I said you know I don't live with my mother anymore. </sentence><sentence id="294">I'm grown up. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="295">I have my own place. </sentence><sentence id="296">He said you never told me that. </sentence><sentence id="297">He said would you like to see your father? </sentence><sentence id="298">I said, yes, very much. </sentence><sentence id="299">And again, my mother's girlfriends and my father's friends are dragging me back into the other <span class="region">side</span>, and I thought to myself, what do I have to loose. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="300">My mother and my two little sisters are not there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="301">I want to see my father. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="302"> and . </sentence><sentence id="303">And it so happened, like one time a doctor told me I have nine </sentence></p><p><sentence id="304"> lives...I have to figure out how many more times before I broke my leg again...and he took me to my father. </sentence><sentence id="305">And you know, the most God-forsaken thing I've ever seen is eight men holding their head on their...hands on their head, walking around and crying like babies because through their <span class="dlf">window</span>, through the <span class="country">Jordan</span> break out a <span class="dlf">window</span>, you could see the way the Germans are dragging, with hand grenades...they were opening the <span class="interior space">bunkers</span> that children were hidden. </sentence><sentence id="306">They were dragging old people and everyone in that <span class="interior space">room</span> had somebody, had children, had a wife at <span class="building">home</span>, or had somebody because they were working for the Jordan brigade and they were protected a little bit with that. </sentence><sentence id="307">And what do I do? </sentence><sentence id="308">All of a sudden I turn eleven again. </sentence><sentence id="309">I put my hand on my head and I start crying and I start following them. </sentence><sentence id="310">At three o'clock they called off the Kinderaktion and I and my father stopped running, and I told you before my Uncle Menashke Saposhnikov was one of the leaders of the underground, so they had to run by their <span class="building">home</span>, so my aunt was lying and bleeding...they took away his two little boys, and my other aunts were helping her and I grabbed my father's arm and we start running in, and we run into this little <span class="building">house</span>...was a <span class="building">peasant house</span> where my mother was with two kids, and there is no sound, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="311">And I stopped crying. </sentence><sentence id="312">I said, Papa, they're dead. </sentence><sentence id="313">Papa, they're "toit". </sentence><sentence id="314">And all of a sudden we heard from <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, "knock", "knock", "knock", - knock. </sentence><sentence id="315">And my mother says quiet. </sentence><sentence id="316">They're not dead. </sentence><sentence id="317">And she opened up that little <span class="spatial object">board</span> that she had, and she dragged down the two kids, and they were completely out...I think a little bit over- dosed. </sentence><sentence id="318">She gave them sleeping <span class="spatial object">tables</span>, and she tells us what happened. </sentence><sentence id="319">I practically and my father fainted right there. </sentence><sentence id="320">And she said, the <span class="spatial object">machines</span> were driving around the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and saying, everybody stay in their <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="321">Anybody that comes out gets shot. </sentence><sentence id="322">And she didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="323">So she took these <span class="spatial object">sleeping tablets</span> and she gave it to the kids, she broke open a little <span class="spatial object">board</span> in there. </sentence><sentence id="324">She, she was thinking fast. </sentence><sentence id="325">She dragged them up. </sentence><sentence id="326">She put them <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="327">Dragged herself up, tipped over the <span class="spatial object">tables</span> so the sand should fall off it because sand came down, and she was lying with them, so when the Germans came in to look if there's children or anybody in the <span class="building">house</span>, they didn't see nothing and they were already dead asleep and my mother was still lying flat, but they had picks. </sentence><sentence id="328">They went into the <span class="interior space">floor</span> and they went into the top with the picks. </sentence><sentence id="329">In fact one of my little sister was just grazed, and she pushed them from one side to the other, and she was also afraid to push them because in case the <span class="env feature">sand</span> start coming down but the Germans thought the <span class="env feature">sand</span> was coming down from their picks. </sentence><sentence id="330">I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="331"> 01:32:  realize it now...of course I didn't know it at that time, you know, but she was afraid at that time. </sentence><sentence id="332">And she had a little <span class="dlf">hole</span> that she saw this <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="333">She saw those mothers taking the kids to the, to those to those <span class="spatial object">machines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="334">And people dragging them and the mothers, they didn't want to give the children up, was being beaten or a dog sent on her, and she saved my two little sisters. </sentence><sentence id="335">Now there was a rumor that...she was a brave lady. </sentence><sentence id="336">She was a beautiful lady. </sentence><sentence id="337">Good, brave, and that they don't have the quota. </sentence><sentence id="338">It's going to go on again. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="339">So I said Momma, let me up with the children, up there, and you go in to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> works on my papers. </sentence><sentence id="340">She said no, you go with your poppa. </sentence><sentence id="341">You're going to be missed and there's going to be something not kosher, and we went away, and she stayed with the children up there, and they called off again the aktion later on and she saved those two little sisters, and I'm selfish enough to think if my mother wouldn't have saved my two little sisters, maybe she would have been alive for a little while longer because she was a very young woman. </sentence><sentence id="342">Because when we were, when the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was liquidated and we were sent into the <span class="populated place">death camp</span>, to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, they separated her with the two kids and they took her away. </sentence><sentence id="343">At that time, to tell you the truth, I didn't know what a <span class="building">crematorium</span> means. </sentence><sentence id="344">I didn't even know what a <span class="building">crematorium</span> is. </sentence><sentence id="345">I know one thing is that when they were still alive and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was going on, before it was liquidated, we had to move them. </sentence><sentence id="346">Don't forget one was born in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="347">My little sister Rosale never knew </sentence></p><p><sentence id="348"> 01:34: what it means to have one piece of bread and a full glass of milk. </sentence><sentence id="349">And what we did is, those new <span class="building">apartments</span>...they made the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller again and we had to move the kids, so the little one we put in a potato sack instead of taking part of her valuables that was left over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put lipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped through because we were not far, like I told you, for the <span class="building">German Kommandatur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">So what happened is every time they made the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> smaller, we had to move them, and the little one was so smart. </sentence><sentence id="351">She was one and a half years old when they liquidated the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and what she did is, when she saw a German...she knew every German by the name...and when she saw a German she would grab the seven year old and say, let's go , and they would hide themselves in the <span class="interior space">closet</span> in a pair of <span class="spatial object">laundry bags</span>. </sentence><sentence id="352">And when they didn't touch them, when they liquidated the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>...we were on a <span class="dlf">field</span> waiting to be put on the <span class="spatial object">trains</span>...they did not touch them. </sentence><sentence id="353">But when they did arrive near <span class="populated place">Stutthoff</span>, my mother had poison tablets. </sentence><sentence id="354">How she got all of them I don't know, and she...father says let's take them because they were separating the men and sending them to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, and the women and the children sending in to <span class="populated place">Stutthoff</span>. </sentence><sentence id="355">There came out little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> with white spots on it, went through a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> or something...I don't remember...everything is not so clear to me...and my mother, the first time she really put her foot down and she says no. </sentence><sentence id="356">No poison tablets. </sentence><sentence id="357">This time we go with destiny. </sentence><sentence id="358">For all the Jewish people are going to go that <span class="dlf">route</span>. </sentence><sentence id="359">We are going to go and if one finger is left to one of my kids or if any of us is saved, it will be worth it to tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="360">And you know, something flipped through my mind when she said it, because this is the woman that was sitting at the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span> when we had the refugees in 1941 from <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Austria</span>...I'm going back again...and I was  very upset with her. </sentence><sentence id="361">We were sitting at the <span class="spatial object">dinner table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="362">She just came back from taking them clothes and food, and she and my father were talking and when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about, they were talking in Russian, and I understood Russian. </sentence><sentence id="363">I spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="364">And she said, you know, those people are exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="365">Nobody can do what they are telling the Germans are doing. </sentence><sentence id="366">And you know, at, as we were dri...driving into <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> in those little <span class="spatial object">wagons</span> and she said, let's go where everybody's going, I remembered that Momma said this once at the <span class="spatial object">table</span> and I was feeling so sorry for Anna Levine, that little Austrian girl, and...but I don't blame her for it because a lot of us didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="367">Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="368">A lot of people of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good when my father would bring some food from the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="369"> Jordan brigade and first it was divided between the family. </sentence><sentence id="370">Then she would take it from us and send it to one of my girlfriends, her sister had a little baby...she would take away from Rosale with some milk and give it to Gitta's sister's baby, and a piece of...a little piece of bread here and a little piece of bread here and I don't know where everything went but she was the most good-hearted person in the world and this is what happened in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="371">They separated us and they took me in...you know, have you every watched the movie, , that they show the <span class="spatial object">gynecologist table</span> with all the dirt and filth. </sentence><sentence id="372">I wrote to the director a letter - it was done very wrong, because at thirteen and a half, they put me on one of those <span class="spatial object">tables</span> to look for gold, and it wasn't a dirty <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="373">The <span class="interior space">room</span> was completely sterilized, white...like I can remember because that one thing will never come out of my mind, and the doctor was...or whoever he was...was all in white with a mask, and he was looking for gold in me, and that's why I said they were very wrong because the Germans weren't working, they wouldn't have worked in a <span class="interior space">room</span> like that, a doctor, because everything was white. </sentence><sentence id="374">All I remember is white. </sentence><sentence id="375">White, white, white, and I remember a <span class="spatial object">gynecologist table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="376">I never knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="377">Until I got pregnant with my son, I never went to a gynecologist, and even now I have very very bad feelings when I have to go up on one. </sentence><sentence id="378">It's a terrible thing to tell it in a video, but I have to tell you that, because it's wrong. </sentence><sentence id="379">The movie was done wrong. </sentence><sentence id="380">So when J arrived in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and they took my mother away and I couldn't go with her, I didn't want to live anymore. </sentence><sentence id="381">I just said to myself whatever I do, I don't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="382">So they said that they are going to take us to little <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> because they need working power. </sentence><sentence id="383">Again they start sorting, you know...the strong one, the not strong ones. </sentence><sentence id="384">But before I go on I have to tell you the story why I have that mark on my head. </sentence><sentence id="385">Max, the sadist from <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, one of the biggest sadists that ever existed. </sentence><sentence id="386">See, they didn't have a chance to shave our hair, because most of the <span class="populated place">Eastern European ghettos</span> were being liquidated, so everybody was coming at one time, so they had time to give us the uniforms, our numbers, but they didn't have time to shave our hair, so I had big long braids, black braids, so at six o'clock...I don't know what time it was...it was still dark...bare-footed...we didn't have any shoes, Max yells appell, so I asked the woman that had threw us, at night they threw us into the <span class="building">barracks</span> on top of other women... what do they mean. </sentence><sentence id="387">Said keep quiet and get out and stand still. </sentence><sentence id="388">So I stand  0 still and SS and he goes through the <span class="dlf">lines</span> like this, like a maniac. </sentence><sentence id="389">I'll never forget, and he said, "Du schwarzer Teufel Du wirdst Stubenaelteste" you black devil are going to be some kind of a post of some kind of clean the latrine or stubenaeltester, you know, the head of the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="390">And I was still braiding, I'm still trying, still braiding my braid. </sentence><sentence id="391">I don't know where my mother is. </sentence><sentence id="392">With the kids I don't know what's happening here. </sentence><sentence id="393">See, I went ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="394">I'm telling you back what happened to me with Max, and I said: "was". </sentence><sentence id="395">Takes me, he breaks my head and hit me on the <span class="building">barrack</span> with my head, and I start bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="396">As the coming down bleeding and I was so confused I didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="397">Why is that man doing it to me? </sentence><sentence id="398">What are those people all around me doing shivering in in striped uniform? </sentence><sentence id="399">Where am I? </sentence><sentence id="400">Where is my mother? </sentence><sentence id="401">All of a sudden I turned thirteen again. </sentence><sentence id="402">What is happening to me? </sentence><sentence id="403">And I looked at him with my two black eyes...they were black and big at that time...and I said, and I looked at him and I didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="404">I didn't move. </sentence><sentence id="405">The blood was running and I didn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="406">And that sadist that didn't have a mind of his own thought I was supernatural. </sentence><sentence id="407">That's what saved my life. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="408">Every time he came into the <span class="building">barrack</span> to beat up the women, every time we were standing in <span class="dlf">line</span>, he was knocking out the soup from our hand...that little bit of water and ___ that we got. </sentence><sentence id="409">He never touched me. </sentence><sentence id="410">I didn't know why, because at that time I didn't figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="411">Now that I'm grown up and I know a little bit of psychology, I figured it out. </sentence><sentence id="412">He thought I was supernatural. </sentence><sentence id="413">How can I get help? </sentence><sentence id="414">How can I heal with a big cut like that and how can I look him straight in the face without crying. </sentence><sentence id="415">That means I didn't hurt. </sentence><sentence id="416">I was supernatural, so he was afraid to touch me again. </sentence><sentence id="417">And that's what saved my life in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and then when they were sorting out the people, stronger on one side, that he was drunk...other people did it. </sentence><sentence id="418">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="419">So we went and they put three <span class="spatial object">boats</span> to go out to those little <span class="populated place">camps</span> to work. </sentence><sentence id="420">And I was in one of the <span class="spatial object">boats</span> and then they decided they don't need three <span class="spatial object">boats</span> and one of <span class="spatial object">boats</span> they set on fire, and the people start jumping from that <span class="spatial object">boat</span> and trying to get on the other <span class="spatial object">boats</span>, and that was dipping the other <span class="spatial object">boats</span>, and you know, I was sitting in my <span class="building">home</span> and watching the boat people and I was crying and my son says to me, Mom, why are you crying? </sentence><sentence id="421">It's natural thing to people that and David. </sentence><sentence id="422">History repeats itself and I told him the story. </sentence><sentence id="423">At that time he was about already eleven and a half years old. </sentence><sentence id="424">I don't know how old he was. </sentence><sentence id="425">He was old enough that I could tell him, and I told him the story what happened, you know, in the <span class="env feature">water</span> with the three <span class="spatial object">boats</span> when they were taking us to the little <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="426">It's all very not clear in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="427">I don't know how to tell it to you, which <span class="spatial object">boat</span> it was and how the people jumped, but I know when I saw the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="428"> boat people, everything was coming back to me. </sentence><sentence id="429">People jumping out of a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="430">People trying to get into another <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, so something clicked in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="431">All of a sudden I realized that something like this somewhere happened to me, and that's what happened. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="432">And they came in those little <span class="populated place">labor camps</span> digging <span class="dlf">foxholes</span> and I didn't care what happened to me at that time because it was so close when they took away my mother and the two little children and I don't know if they were killed in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>, if they were taken away somewhere else, because I know they gave them civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="433">So why take them  1 to a <span class="building">crematorium</span> in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and put civilian clothes on them. </sentence><sentence id="434">But I still know that it happened in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and they...for me they died in <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">Maybe they took them to <span class="populated place">Theresienstadt</span>. </sentence><sentence id="436">I don't know where they took them. </sentence><sentence id="437">And I just didn't want to go on anymore, but you know, in back of mind was one thing - survive, survive. </sentence><sentence id="438">Take revenge. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="439">Survive. </sentence><sentence id="440">Take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="441">Survive. </sentence><sentence id="442">Take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="443">So what I would I do is those little <span class="populated place">camps</span>, they're always stationed near a <span class="env feature">lake</span> and in the winter I would break open the <span class="env feature">ice</span> and I would wash myself with the, with cold water and the tea that they gave us...the hair start growing out...I would rub into my head, the warm tea. </sentence><sentence id="444">So Mrs. Gelta (ph) and we </sentence></p><p><sentence id="445"> is alive, she lived a hundred

[ </sentence><sentence id="565">just wanted to go <span class="building">home</span> and see if anybody's alive. </sentence><sentence id="566">And we went to the Russian. </sentence><sentence id="567">They said oh yes, we'll send you <span class="building">home</span> and they put us on <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and they sent us to <span class="dlf">farms</span> in <span class="populated place">Pomerania</span>, and there's a story by itself. </sentence><sentence id="568">We arrive in <span class="populated place">Pomerania</span> and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick things, you know, and they want, needed food for <span class="country">Russia</span> so what they did is they opened a <span class="building">cheese factory</span>, where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and the Jewish girls were cleaning the <span class="interior space">stalls</span> from the cows, everything. </sentence><sentence id="569">After the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and after what they went through so in one time it comes, the captain comes to us. </sentence><sentence id="570">He says who wants to go in <span class="populated place">Rickenwald</span> (ph).There is a veterinarian doctor from <span class="populated place">Moscow</span> and he wants to teach you to be a veterinarian nurse. </sentence><sentence id="571">In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am game. </sentence><sentence id="572">I'm game of anything. </sentence><sentence id="573">I said I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="574">I mean, there we were also kept like in a <span class="building">prison</span> but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could never walk from one <span class="populated place">village</span> to another without a Russian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="575">So I went to <span class="populated place">Rickenwald</span> and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks [colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress. </sentence><sentence id="576">This is a <span class="spatial object">nightgown</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">Put on this. </sentence><sentence id="578">I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you know, that way. </sentence><sentence id="579">I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to teach us was a drunkard. </sentence><sentence id="580">Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="581">The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a big stamp. </sentence><sentence id="582">He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse. </sentence><sentence id="583">So I came back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and  6 they put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian. </sentence><sentence id="584">This, I'm liberated already. </sentence><sentence id="585">And he said I want Maruska (ph), Mar...Maruska at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="586">And the captain said, Maruska at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="587">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="588">I told you when I telephoned you that I want her at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">My wife wants to talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="590">So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the <span class="building">cheese factory</span>, so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the <span class="env feature">lungs</span> and then the rest they would cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="591">The good ones they would make conserves themselves. </sentence><sentence id="592">They opened a <span class="building">conserve factory</span> and send it to <span class="country">Russian</span> and so the cheese, the Russian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I would give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was. </sentence><sentence id="593">The captain had everything at the <span class="spatial object">table</span>, but the soldier had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="594">So they liked me very much. </sentence><sentence id="595">And Polkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me. </sentence><sentence id="596">He makes me...now remember, this is "45 and it was beginning of "45 when I was liberated and went though it. </sentence><sentence id="597">Let's say I was fifteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="598">I wasn't even fifteen years old, and they send me as the head of the <span class="building">cheese factory</span>, and they send and a big <span class="building">house</span> and I get the <span class="building">house</span> of the woman that owned it, and she got to be my housekeeper but she never was because she was a beautiful lady, and I made up...one thing I forgot to tell you...I'm going to take revenge. </sentence><sentence id="599">I'm going to take revenge of the people, so I was riding a horse, being that I was a veterinarian nurse I had to go to the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and see if the <span class="spatial object">cows</span> are clean, if the German women are taking care of it, and I saw some children on the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I would fly by with my horse and and I was careful not to hurt them, but I thought I had and I walked into a <span class="building">German house</span> and I would, with my boot I was always opening like they did our <span class="building">house</span>, and you know after four weeks what I did. </sentence><sentence id="600">I stole from the Russians and I gave the medicine, because we Jewish people are compassionate people and we cannot see anybody suffer. </sentence><sentence id="601">Took medicines to them. </sentence><sentence id="602">I took food to them. </sentence><sentence id="603">Would you believe it? </sentence><sentence id="604">And the German woman in <span class="populated

id="606">She was my equal and I was fifteen years old and my mind was working and one story I have to tell you that is the most fantastic story, that | am writing about my experience after the war with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="607">He came to me one day and he says to me, you know, he says to me I had a lot of, before that I tell you I had a 02:11: lot...there was to clean. </sentence><sentence id="608">There was a big <span class="building">airport</span> not far from where I stayed in 5 and they brought...a lot of fliers, majors and captains would come to visit me. </sentence><sentence id="609">They were boar hunting, you know, and they brought vodka and there was a <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and they were playing and when they got real drunk...that that housekeeper of mine, that lady that  7 owned the "gut"[estate], would lock me in her <span class="interior space">room</span> that they couldn't touch me.(Laughter) You understand what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="610">But they were very close to me, so the captain came to me and said I have a problem. </sentence><sentence id="611">I said what's your problem? </sentence><sentence id="612">He said I need seven horses. </sentence><sentence id="613">I said why? </sentence><sentence id="614">He said because the horses is in my <span class="populated

the people love you here and they'll give it to you. </sentence><sentence id="615">I said nobody gives nothing because it came out I think that the Russians cannot take anything away from the Germans, from farmers, anything. </sentence><sentence id="616">Nothing can be touched again. </sentence><sentence id="617">No cows, no horses, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="618">What's theirs belongs to

</sentence><sentence id="640">I put them on a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> and I sent them back to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, and the captain had seven horses, because one I had kept for him. </sentence><sentence id="641">From then on, I was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="642">He was afraid of me. </sentence><sentence id="643">You understand what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="644">Because I had something over him. </sentence><sentence id="645">But I had the protection of the Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="646">I had the protection of the German people - they like me because I didn't hurt them in any way. </sentence><sentence id="647">I had the protection of a lot of officers that knew me, the protection of the polkovnik. </sentence><sentence id="648">So one day I am going with a man from <span class="country">Georgia</span>, from <span class="country">Russia</span>, a soldier, riding into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> to look over what's going on, and a short Jewish man comes up to me and said, you know somebody by the name of Maruska Saposhnikov and I said . </sentence><sentence id="649">And that man from <span class="populated place">Grushin</span>, from <span class="country">Georgia</span>, says to me, don't worry Maruska, he says. </sentence><sentence id="650">Whatever this man wants from you, nothing will be said. </sentence><sentence id="651">I said I have to leave without nothing or anything. </sentence><sentence id="652">He wants to take me. </sentence><sentence id="653">My father is alive in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and he wants to take me with him. </sentence><sentence id="654">My father sent him. </sentence><sentence id="655">Now if you want to go and tell to the captain, you're alright. </sentence><sentence id="656">Go tell him. </sentence><sentence id="657">But I have to go. </sentence><sentence id="658">He said not only will I let you go, I will take you there with that gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="659">But I said I can't let you do it, but you know what I'll do. </sentence><sentence id="660">I said I will write you a letter what happened between me and the captain. </sentence><sentence id="661">You just say to him you have a letter about the secret seven horses from <span class="populated place">Maruska</span>, I said, and that's all...that nothing, I don't think  8 nothing will happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="662">But I said I appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="663">He took us to the <span class="spatial object">train</span> and we left and I met my father in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="664">And later on, some girls escaped from there too, some Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="665">He kept his word. </sentence><sentence id="666">Some of them were released. </sentence><sentence id="667">They escaped and they told me that that guy lies ina <span class="spatial object">hammock</span> and it's catered to him. </sentence><sentence id="668">Masha they said... at that time I was calling myself already Masha. </sentence><sentence id="669"><span class="building">Maruska</span>, what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="670">I said this is between me and that <span class="populated place">Grushin</span>, nobody else and that's the story about the seven horses. </sentence><sentence id="671">I'll never forget it. </sentence><sentence id="672">As many things I did to him that he didn't know, you know. </sentence><sentence id="673">When I came back from <span class="populated place">Riegenwald</span>, being a veterinarian nurse that I was not...I knew that much, all I knew is how to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and how to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything is clean. </sentence><sentence id="674">And when I came back from <span class="populated place">Riegenwald</span> after the <span class="spatial object">polkovnik</span> was there, in about a period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the <span class="spatial object">piano</span> and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. </sentence><sentence id="675">But I was in danger from them also. </sentence><sentence id="676">So I had to run away somehow, so my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of there, and this is how I came to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, because my father survived <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> and we met in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="677">And then we had to go to, run away from the <span class="spatial object">AK</span>, from the fascists in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> because you couldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="678">I didn't speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="679">My father didn't speak Polish, so how...you couldn't even go out on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="680">My father was working as a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="681">He hardly made a living, but one thing he did is he had an <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">Everybody went to to <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> from somewhere, one <span class="populated place">camp</span> or another...he wouldn't let them go back to <span class="country">Lithuanian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">Always kept them there. </sentence><sentence id="684">It was a big, big <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="685">Many people told me before I even came what my father did for them. </sentence><sentence id="686">But it was also a beautiful thing that he did and he died pretty young, and what happened is is we had to smuggle the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="687">So how do we smuggle the <span class="dlf">border</span>. </sentence><sentence id="688">It costs a lot of money. </sentence><sentence id="689">So Masha went to work in a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> and made friends with the <span class="spatial object">Brichah</span> and took a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> in 1945...I wasn't even fifteen years old...in July I was fifteen. </sentence><sentence id="690">I took a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> with my father and my...at that time she was already my step-mother, Rochele, all through to <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span> and the AK was shooting after us, and I stopped the people because my step- 02:19: mother couldn't walk that well. </sentence><sentence id="691">She just had an operation in <span class="country">Poland</span> and they were shooting. </sentence><sentence id="692">The people were screaming and I said I promised you to get you across and I will get you across, and I got them across to <span class="populated place">Bratislava</span>. </sentence><sentence id="693">But I loved <span class="country">Austria</span>...and I stayed in <span class="country">Austria</span> after the war and I went to <span class="building">school</span> there, and my husband was , before I met my husband. </sentence><sentence id="694">And I worked for the <span class="building">Brichah</span>. </sentence><sentence id="695">I helped people smuggle from <span class="populated place">sonnenfeld</span> because I went to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="696">I spoke pretty good Austrian. </sentence><sentence id="697">Let my braid grow again. </sentence><sentence id="698">Put on an Austrian outfit into <span class="populated place">Sonnenfeld</span> and smuggled people over the <span class="dlf">Innsbruck border</span> into <span

think I settled down a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="701">And I came to <span class="country">America</span> and we lost ev...my husband lost everything we had and one thing I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="702">We came into <span class="populated place">New Orleans</span> and somebody once asked me, how do you like this <span class="country">country</span>? </sentence><sentence

remember, when we come come to <span class="country">America</span>, I won't help you. </sentence><sentence id="707">You'll have to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence
