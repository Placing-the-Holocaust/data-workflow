Okay, there is one other point that I need to make. </sentence><sentence id="4358">The <span class="country">United States of America</span>, to its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the Jews of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="4359">And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the past but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others. </sentence><sentence id="4360">And that is a credit, because in the <span class="country">United States</span>, after they recognized what they had done wrong or been complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state of <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4361">They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or

class="country">country</span>, the lone voice. </sentence><sentence id="4362">Many, many time <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">England</span>, right, who should have supported, right, <span class="country">Israel</span>, they voted the other way or they remained silent. </sentence><sentence id="4363">The <span class="country">United States of America</span>, to its great credit, also grew up and learned. </sentence><sentence id="4364">And the fact that we today even consider that a black could be president of the <span class="country">United States</span>, or a woman become president of the <span class="country">United States</span> finally, I think in great part is the lessons that were learned by the <span class="country">United States</span> to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4365">So the generosity of this <span class="country">country</span>, and it is a generous <span class="country">country</span>, I think in part, is a debt of repayment to what they didn't do to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4366">But that doesn't diminish my love for this <span class="country">country</span>.
