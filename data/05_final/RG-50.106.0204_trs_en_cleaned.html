<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: My father, Henry, was born in <span class="populated place">Mamel</span> [ph] which is in, near <span class="region">East Prussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="22">It's now a <span class="building">military base</span> of <span class="country">Russia</span> I believe. </sentence><sentence id="23">And he moved to <span class="region">Silesia</span>, at some point. </sentence><sentence id="24">I don't know exactly when. </sentence><sentence id="25">And eventually landed in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> where he was in business. </sentence><sentence id="26">His name was Henry because his father had been an Anglophile and that led to all kinds of complications to which we can return perhaps for Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="27">Would you like me to talk about it now? </sentence><sentence id="28">Let's talk about it later. </sentence><sentence id="29">Yeah, my mother Rosa Lipziger [ph] and her maiden name, was born in a small <span class="populated place">town</span> in <span class="region">Silesia</span>, called <span class="populated place">Schlictenstein</span> [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="30">At some point she must also have moved to <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> and my father, they got married. </sentence><sentence id="31">I don't know the exact date. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="47"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 4 March 18, 2013 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: My father was a small businessman. </sentence><sentence id="49">I don't think he was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="50">I'm not sure exactly why that was so because at the times he was a Jew and it was getting difficult to do business in <span class="country">Germany</span>, obviously, during the Nazi period in particular. </sentence><sentence id="51">He had a <span class="building">wholesale store</span> for stockings and socks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: And your mother, did she work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: No, she did not. </sentence><sentence id="59">We were two children. </sentence><sentence id="60">I had a small brother who unfortunately died in an accident at an early age. </sentence><sentence id="61">I think he was eight so I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="62">But my mother did not work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And your brother's name was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Franz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: What kind of <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> did you live in? </sentence><sentence id="73">Was it a Jewish, a non-Jewish mixed <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> or was it predominantly Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: [really don't think there were <span class="populated place">Jewish neighborhoods</span> in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> at the time. </sentence><sentence id="77">Things were very intermixed which is quite typical of course for German Jewry who as you know were well assimilated by and large. </sentence><sentence id="78">We lived in two locations. </sentence><sentence id="79">I went back to <span class="populated place">Velatslav</span> [ph] some 15 years ago, the first <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> where we had lived, didn't exist anymore and the second one hardly at all either. </sentence><sentence id="80">So we lived in two locations. </sentence><sentence id="81">We had an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and we had a maid which was kind of expected for any middle class Jewish family, even though my father could hardly afford it but he did have one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: So your <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> was made up of Jewish and non-Jewish children whom you played with I assume. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Yeah, I went to a regular <span class="building">German public school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">Whether there were any other Jewish children in that <span class="building">class</span>, I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="92">Certainly, possibly not. </sentence><sentence id="93">Certainly in the, in the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 5 March 18, 2013 <span class="building">elementary school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">Later on I transferred to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>, a <span class="building">high school</span> and there probably were other Jewish children in that <span class="building">class</span>. </sentence><sentence id="95">Now I think I was allowed to stay in this <span class="building">German high school</span> because my father had been a what they call a frontkempfer [ph], somebody who had fought in combat in World War I, and Jews who had that status had at the beginning certain privileges. </sentence><sentence id="96">One of them was that while other Jewish children had to leave the <span class="building">German schools</span>, I was allowed to stay in that <span class="building">gymnasium</span> for a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="97">But eventually we all had to leave anyway and I transferred to a <span class="building">Jewish gymnasium</span> and | went to that <span class="building">school</span> until 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Do you remember when you transferred, what year it was when you transferred? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: ""m not sure. </sentence><sentence id="110">I would think it probably was 37. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: 37. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Let's talk a little bit more about your family. </sentence><sentence id="118">Were they very assimilated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Quite, yes. </sentence><sentence id="122">My parents did go to <span class="building">synagogue</span> on high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="123">I think the <span class="building">synagogue</span>, the largest in <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>, was probably conservative. </sentence><sentence id="124">There was Pesach in our family which my father could not conduct but we had an uncle who did know the ritual and he usually conducted the Seder. </sentence><sentence id="125">And there was a large gathering. </sentence><sentence id="126">I would think perhaps about 12, 14 people at Pesach time. </sentence><sentence id="127">But that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="128">I was bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="129">But that was kind of expected. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was socially expected so it was more a social ritual than a religious one. </sentence><sentence id="131">I certainly had no strong religious feelings one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="132">I liked the bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="133">I got lots of presents. </sentence><sentence id="134">So basically our family was yes, assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="135">My father belonged to an organization called <span class="building">Risebund Judische Front Soldaten</span> [ph] . </sentence><sentence id="136">That meant the national organization of Jewish combat soldiers in World War I. He was very proud of that. </sentence><sentence id="137">And again that was a fairly typical attitude on the part of German Jews at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="building">home</span>? </sentence><sentence id="156"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Let's talk also now about your extended family. </sentence><sentence id="165">You mentioned about your uncle helping to conduct the Seder. </sentence><sentence id="166">Did you have a large extended family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: We had a large family yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: On both sides. </sentence><sentence id="173">On your mother's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: On both sides. </sentence><sentence id="175">Very large family, including grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="176">I enjoyed visiting my grand -- one of my grandparents lived in a <span class="populated place">town</span> near where my mother had been born, also in <span class="region">Silesia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">I enjoyed visiting there. </sentence><sentence id="178">I had some friends there. </sentence><sentence id="179">The most successful in our family was my mother's brother. </sentence><sentence id="180">He had a <span class="building">business</span>, <span class="building">wholesale business</span> in <span class="env feature">woods</span> and was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="181">He was really quite rich. </sentence><sentence id="182">And he had been a, also an officer in World War I. He was altogether a very stately German appearance, tall, straight. </sentence><sentence id="183">There is an interesting story connected to him which I think would be of interest. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: His name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: His name was Friedel Lipziger. </sentence><sentence id="187">Lipziger was my mother's maiden name. </sentence><sentence id="188">He considered himself even more German than anyone else in our family because of his background and I remember a family gathering, must have been around 1936 and I, being all of 13, dared to say, I was in a youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="189">I'll come back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="190">I dared to say that perhaps one should think of emigrating and you know this was 36, three years into the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="191">My uncle took me by the scruff and shook me back and forth and said what do you understand about such things? </sentence><sentence id="192">Ok, that was in 1936 I believe. </sentence><sentence id="193">He very soon however must have had, begin to have second thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="194">So to be on the safe side, he started to ship out money, illegally of course and one of the couriers who had my uncle's money was caught and he had a list of names. </sentence><sentence id="195">So one afternoon, my uncle got a telephone call from the police chief of <span class="populated place">Breslau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">Now mind you, <span class="populated place">Breslau</span> was a <span class="populated place">city</span> of 600,000 people so the police chief was quite somebody. </sentence><sentence id="197">It so happened that  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 7 March 18, 2013 he was a war comrade of my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="198">And he said Friedel, this and this has happened. </sentence><sentence id="199">I give you three hours. </sentence><sentence id="200">You must get out of <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="201">Otherwise I will come to arrest you. </sentence><sentence id="202">So my uncle took his family, his wife and daughter and got on a <span class="spatial object">train</span> and left for <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="203">So that was the end of my uncle who had thought that it was stupid to think of emigrating. </sentence><sentence id="204">He then from <span class="country">France</span> got to <span class="country">Brazil</span> where he again opened a highly successful <span class="building">wood business</span>, which was very appropriate for <span class="country">Brazil</span> and he became perhaps even richer than before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Let's talk about your life from 1923 to 1933, until Hitler came into power. </sentence><sentence id="226">What memories, I know you were a child, you were only ten years old but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: [have memories. </sentence><sentence id="228">I have rather -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Talk about some of those memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well for one thing, I belonged to a <span class="building">youth movement</span> and that is important for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: At that young age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Yes, I must have joined perhaps when I was eight, nine, very early. </sentence><sentence id="236">This was a youth movement which called itself <span class="building">German Jewish Boy Scouts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="237">And German Jewish was more German than it was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="238">We sang German songs and we had a little uniform and flags and we would parade up and down and go on hikes and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="239">It also was kind of romantic. </sentence><sentence id="240">It, the German youth movement has been described by writers like Walter Laqueur and others and it had this romantic flavor to it. </sentence><sentence id="241">You were opposed to the philistines and you dreamt of some wonderful future in which you would be important, intellectually perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="242">And so this I think in many ways was very important for my own thinking and, and future life. </sentence><sentence id="243">It sort of shaped me quite significantly I believe. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then came Hitler in 33 and we were forbidden to use uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="245">And then we were also forbidden to go on hikes and on the last hike that we had staged we were attacked in the middle of the night and had to leave and go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Attacked because you were a Jewish group? </sentence><sentence id="258"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="261"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 8 March 18, 2013 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: Because we were a Jewish group, hiking which we were -- and, and having a <span class="populated place">camp</span> which we're not supposed to have anymore. </sentence><sentence id="263">But they hadn't informed us that formally so we still were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="264">So that was the end of hiking and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Who was the leader of your group? </sentence><sentence id="266">The adult leader? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: The leader of my group was someone called Walter Laqueur who was quite known as an historian. </sentence><sentence id="268">He was all of two years older than we were in this group but he was our leader. </sentence><sentence id="269">That's how he was known. </sentence><sentence id="270">And we would get together and several times a month and read things and discuss things or listen to classical music and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="271">Then about 1934 it must have been, perhaps 35, our organization merged with a Zionist organization called <span class="building">Zichloiter</span> and that organization in turn eventually became part of <span class="building">Hashomer Hatzair</span>. </sentence><sentence id="272">And the <span class="spatial object">Hashomer Hatzair</span> is something that eventually became known in <span class="country">Israel</span> as <span class="populated place">Mapai</span>, as you probably know. </sentence><sentence id="273">So our, the character of our life changed in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="274">We all of a sudden started to sing Jewish and Hebrew songs and learn something about our Jewish background of which we were frightfully ignorant until then. </sentence><sentence id="275">And we became kind of Zionists, gradually. </sentence><sentence id="276">And this went on for a few years. </sentence><sentence id="277">And then came Kristallnacht in November of 1938.Now shortly before that I had gone to a <span class="dlf">farm</span> in <span class="region">southern Germany</span> in preparation for going to what was then <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And it was called <span class="populated place">Hasharav</span> [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="279">That term means something for you. </sentence><sentence id="280">And we were there, about 30 Jewish kids and we were learning agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="281">And on Kristallnacht the first thing we heard things over the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="282">And it was too late to leave so we sort of barricaded ourselves and hoped for the best. </sentence><sentence id="283">But sure enough a large group of storm troopers eventually appeared and attacked and beat us up rather badly. </sentence><sentence id="284">And some people were hurt. </sentence><sentence id="285">And the event dispersed and everyone went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="286">When I came <span class="building">home</span> my father had been arrested, like all German Jews at the time, all male German Jews and taken to a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="287">He was taken to <span class="populated place">Buchenwald</span>. </sentence><sentence id="288">And now I come back to Henry, my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="289">As I said his father had been an Anglophile. </sentence><sentence id="290">He had been called Henry. </sentence><sentence id="291">Came World War I and my father volunteered for military service to fight against the perfidious Albion. </sentence><sentence id="292">You could not be called Henry. </sentence><sentence id="293">So they changed his name to Heinrich. </sentence><sentence id="294">So some of his papers were Heinrich and some of his papers were Henry. </sentence><sentence id="295">And of course that became a cause Celebrex for the German  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 9 March 18, 2013 bureaucracy in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">They didn't know what to make of it. </sentence><sentence id="297">And he therefore was one of the last to get out. </sentence><sentence id="298">The procedure was that you would, they would let people out from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, if they had a place to go to, to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="299">The whole, one of the main purposes of the arrest of the male Jews was to put pressure on them to leave the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="300">At that time, and that is also confirmed by written documents that we have. </sentence><sentence id="301">The main idea was to push the Jews out, get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="302">And so if you had a place to emigrate to, they would release you. </sentence><sentence id="303">But because of my father, with this mix up of names, he was one of the last to get out, even though we had a possibility to leave. </sentence><sentence id="304">Now this is, this involves the following. </sentence><sentence id="305">My father's brother and sister had been early Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="306">They had belonged to a German Zionist organization called <span class="building">Blue White</span>, <span class="building">Blau Weis</span>, very well known. </sentence><sentence id="307">And they left for <span class="country">Palestine</span> in the 20s already and had become well established in <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="308">My aunt, my father's sister was a librarian at the <span class="building">Hebrew University</span>. </sentence><sentence id="309">My, his brother was a well-known architect in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span>. </sentence><sentence id="310">And they tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Bruno Lewy and <span class="building">Alma Shunami</span>. </sentence><sentence id="360">She married a man who became quite well known after World War II, Alex Shunami, because he was sent by the <span class="building">Yeshuv</span> to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="361">He was a librarian as well to recover stolen German books and became quite well known in that capacity. </sentence><sentence id="362">He was very successful. </sentence><sentence id="363">He got a <span class="spatial object">Jeep</span> and an American chauffeur and he was able to move all around and recover German books by the thousands, stolen Jewish books by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="364">Anyway that was my aunt's husband. </sentence><sentence id="365">They tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="country">Palestine</span> but the British did not let any adults in. </sentence><sentence id="366">They let young people in, but not adults. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: Was your father a Zionist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: No, not at all but you know by that time he had realized. </sentence><sentence id="378">I mean after Kristallnacht in particular -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Preceding that, he had not been. </sentence><sentence id="380"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="381"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Guenter Lewy 10 March 18, 2013 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: They may have been thinking about emigrating but nothing concrete had happened. </sentence><sentence id="383">The problem, as you probably know, was to find a place to take you. </sentence><sentence id="384">The problem was not to get out of <span class="country">Germany</span> but to find a place to take you. </sentence><sentence id="385">There was legal emigration out of <span class="country">Germany</span> until October 1941. </sentence><sentence id="386">So the problem was to find a place, not to get out, get permission to leave the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="387">The Nazis were pushing the Jews out. </sentence><sentence id="388">So he had no place but my uncle in <span class="populated place">Jerusalem</span> worked very hard on this and it didn't move forward. </sentence><sentence id="389">So as an interim measure, they came up with the following. </sentence><sentence id="390">My uncle's wife was from <span class="populated place">Vienna</span> and her brother was Grand redam [ph] de Luxembourg so the chief rabbi of <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>, the chief rabbi of <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="391">So they arranged for a permit for my parents to go to <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="392">And so I left in March of 39 for <span class="country">Palestine</span> with Youth Aliyah, because I wanted to be in a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="393">And my parents shortly thereafter left for <span class="country">Luxembourg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="394">So I came to <span class="country">Palestine</span> in March of 1939 and went to a <span class="populated place">kibbutz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
