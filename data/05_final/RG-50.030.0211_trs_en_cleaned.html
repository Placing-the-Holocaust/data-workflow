<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: What happened to your family then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: In that time, my father was extremely well-to-do. </sentence><sentence id="126">He had good days and bad days. </sentence><sentence id="127">But in that time, so happened that he had horses and chickens and, and, and, and cows. </sentence><sentence id="128">And the day he died, before the age of 12 or about, I suddenly became the old man of the family, and I had to take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother, but I had to take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines. </sentence><sentence id="129">I had my own porcupine, who was still in the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="130">And I had to take care of all that. </sentence><sentence id="131">And it was a little too much for me. </sentence><sentence id="132">My older sister happened to have had escaped from <span class="country">Lithuania</span> to <span class="region">deep Russia</span> in the First World War, and she came back as a returnee. </sentence><sentence id="133">She had a husband and two children. </sentence><sentence id="134">All three of them died from hunger in her presence, so she was mentally slightly touched off. </sentence><sentence id="135">And when I decided to sell all the cows and all the horses and everything, to liquidate the <span class="dlf">properties</span>, she became disturbed, and she grabbed a knife, and she was ready to stab me. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I escaped and came to the <span class="populated place">capital</span>, <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, where one of my sisters was married by then already, and I stayed with her. </sentence><sentence id="137">And from there on, I developed myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, that happened within a period of a few weeks or a few months. </sentence><sentence id="154">So I was about 14 -- 13 to 14 when that incident happened, and I came to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: And once you got to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: I stayed for a little while with my married sister. </sentence><sentence id="159">And after that, I got myself a job as a messenger boy in different <span class="building">retail outlets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">And from there on, I, I kept building my life the best way I can. </sentence><sentence id="161">All my other sisters were single, and they all had boyfriends. </sentence><sentence id="162">And all their boyfriends were ready to marry them except they refused to marry them without getting the dowry, which was the custom in the Jewish tradition in those days, which was called nadn." </sentence><sentence id="163">And without nadn, they weren't ready to marry them. </sentence><sentence id="164">We helped marry off my first sister by issuing "veksels,""" which is promissory notes, of five thousand dollars for the two <span class="building">houses</span> which we owned. </sentence><sentence id="165">Both <span class="building">houses</span> were connected to each other, and there was a <span class="building">barn</span> where we kept the cows and the horses in between the <span class="building">houses</span> so you could walk from the inside. </sentence><sentence id="166">It was a valuable property in those days. </sentence><sentence id="167">So the promissory notes that we had, first my mother and I had to sign up to my first brother-in-law, otherwise he would not have married my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="185">And when you were living in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, as you got older, what different kinds of jobs did you have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Since I didn't had any schooling; it was forbidden while I was a <span class="building">yeshiva</span> bokher to educate myself. </sentence><sentence id="189">And we were living eight boys in one <span class="interior space">room</span>, for the sole purpose that the boys should spy on each other, or not one of the boys should do something wrong illegally. </sentence><sentence id="190">And reading a book in any language other than the Gemara was a illegal deed. </sentence><sentence id="191">So I had to have a candle, a lighted candle, covered with my blanket in order to read literature. </sentence><sentence id="192">And I tried to study, to educate myself. </sentence><sentence id="193">I gave up the study in <span class="building">yeshiva</span>, because a student relative of mine in <span class="populated place">Vilkomir</span>, by the name of Yankel Zibutz (ph) smuggled me in the life of Baruch Spinoza and Israel Acosta (ph). </sentence><sentence id="194">And when I was finished reading those two books under the candlelight covered in my <span class="spatial object">bed</span> at night, in the danger of burning down the whole <span class="populated place">village</span> and the whole <span class="building">house</span>, I realized that to be a <span class="building">yeshiva bokher</span> and continue is not for me. </sentence><sentence id="195">I became a educated skeptic, and I gave up the study. </sentence><sentence id="196">And by then, my father died and it happened what it happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="197">So without any trade, I was too young for any trade or any occupation. </sentence><sentence id="198">So I was getting jobs in <span class="building">retail outlets</span> to make deliveries, and I joined up a <span class="building">Yiddish cultural night school</span>, where they was teaching people who didn't had the elementary schooling to be educated in the -- at night. </sentence><sentence id="199">And that is my -- what I had. </sentence><sentence id="200">After working for several <span class="building">retail outlets</span>, I finally got myself a job in a <span class="building">office supply retail outlet</span> by a childless couple. </sentence><sentence id="201">And they, more or less, treated me like their own child. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I grew up with them, and became a adult with those people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I -- being engaged in a <span class="building">office products company</span>, and where the Lithuanian intellectuals, under the leadership of the priests and the, and the educated people started a tremendous antisemitic hate campaign towards the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="220">And the <span class="building">office products company</span> were the first victims, because it was only and primarily the government institutions like the <span class="building">Foreign Ministry</span> and the <span class="building">Diplomatic Ministry</span> and the <span class="building">Internal Ministry</span>, and all the other <span class="building">government agencies</span> who were the prime customers of the <span class="building">office supply companies</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221">And the government and the fascist Siauliaitist party kept sending pickets to picket some of the <span class="building">Jewish stores</span> so gentiles should not come in. </sentence><sentence id="222">And the government instructions was not to buy from Jews. </sentence><sentence id="223">I attempted, with the help of the proprietors of the <span class="building">company</span>, to do something in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I took a trip to my <span class="populated place">village</span>, which was <span class="populated place">Aniksht</span>. </sentence><sentence id="225">And there, I discussed with a gentile former childhood friend of mine by the name of Jonas Kovalisch (ph), and I encouraged him to come to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and to buy out the existing <span class="building">retail outlet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And he lined up a, a, another gentile gentleman by the name of Jonas Svinkeviches (ph), who was a former publisher of the, of dictionaries and other books, and was not engaged in that time in any business. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the two of them bought out the <span class="building">company</span>, and it became a pure Christian company. </sentence><sentence id="228">And they became extremely successful because all the agencies of the <span class="building">government institutions</span> immediately start to buy from them. </sentence><sentence id="229">I still remained with the company as a inside man in the, in the closed, in the -- in the locked -- locked inside <span class="interior space">quarters</span>, far away from the eye of the public. </sentence><sentence id="230">And yet, the very same purchasing agents of the very same <span class="building">government agencies</span> who were placing the orders, refused to deal with the pure Lithuanian Christian employees, and they dealt only with me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: And this was shortly before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: That was up until 1933. </sentence><sentence id="234">In 1933, it became more and more difficult, and my position with the <span class="building">company</span> became more and more difficult because people didn't stay in their job very long. </sentence><sentence id="235">People got old. </sentence><sentence id="236">People got married. </sentence><sentence id="237">They moved away. </sentence><sentence id="238">So new employees came in the <span class="building">purchasing departments</span>, and they didn't want to be bothered with buying, with, with taking care of, with me helping them take care of. </sentence><sentence id="239">So my position became more or less obsolete. </sentence><sentence id="240">So Jonas Kowalisch (ph) decided, with my consent, that instead of keeping me in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> on the job which I had no, no, no purpose anymore and there was no way how I could get any other existence, he decided to send me on a trip to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="241">Since the relationship was so good with all the government agencies, he made me make an appointment with the protocol chief of the <span class="building">Foreign Ministry</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">And when I had the appointment with that gentlemen, he told me, "David, I'll give you diplomatic papers that you are a diplomatic courier. </sentence><sentence id="243">I'll give you two <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span>, where you'll deliver to the <span class="building">Lithuanian Embassy</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> -- or to the <span class="building">Lithuanian Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="244">And you will travel as a diplomatic courier, and you'll be able to get a visa and come in to the <span class="country">United States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">If I will not have -- and I certainly will not have -- any documents to send it to you -- with you. </sentence><sentence id="246">I will put in  <span class="spatial object">newspapers</span> and fill it in." </sentence><sentence id="247">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="248">I got a visa. </sentence><sentence id="249">I arrived to <span class="country">America</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">I delivered the two <span class="spatial object">suitcases</span> to the Consul General, to the Lithuanian Consul General, in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I went to my, my family from <span class="populated place">Bedford Hills</span> picked me up, and I stayed there for a short period of time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: No, I did not go back to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="274">And then, when my immigration, when my visa time expired, I discovered that if you have fifty dollars in your pocket, you can take any <span class="spatial object">transportation</span> and arrive in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span> without any documents, in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>, <span class="country">Portugal</span>, without any visas or any documents. </sentence><sentence id="275">Or maybe they did require some kind of a paper where you would get where you get it in the, in the <span class="building">Portuguese Consulate</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="276">I had the fifty dollars. </sentence><sentence id="277">I arranged everything, and I took a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, and two weeks later, I arrived in <span class="populated place">Lisbon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="278">And I attempt to get established over there, to build up my existence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Um-hm, and what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: After a while -- by then it was already closer to 1936. </sentence><sentence id="288">After a while, the sit- the situation in <span class="region">eastern Europe</span>, particularly <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and the three <span class="region">Baltic states</span> -- <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, <span class="country">Latvia</span> and <span class="country">Estonia</span> -- became extremely dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="289">Vul-vulnerable from <span class="populated place">Hitler</span>'s part and from <span class="populated place">Stalin</span>'s part. </sentence><sentence id="290">Those three <span class="region">Baltic countries</span> are like a little kitten squeezed in between a lion and a hippopotamus. </sentence><sentence id="291">And I felt that my five sisters -- I'm sorry -- by then it was only four sisters, because one of my brother-in-laws, my youngest sister Hanke (ph), was a leftist activist in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="292">And <span class="country">Lithuania</span> was a fascist government under the rule of President Smetona."" </sentence><sentence id="293">And he was in danger to be arrested and be imprisoned for a long, long time -- escaped to <span class="region">South America</span>, to <span class="country">Uruguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="294">And three, four months after he arrived in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>, he sent papers for my sister. </sentence><sentence id="295">So the two of them were in <span class="country">Uruguay</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">So I was left with four sisters. </sentence><sentence id="297">I realized that if anything happens, anything dramatic happens to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> or to <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, all my four sisters, with all their four husbands -- each of them had four or five children -- and with all their children -- and my mother, my mother must have been 70 years by then. </sentence><sentence id="298">They will be destroyed in 10 minutes after anything happened, without me and my supervision and my ability to survive. </sentence><sentence id="299">So I voluntarily left <span class="country">Portugal</span> to go back to <span class="country">Lithuania</span> to be with my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: And what happened when you got back? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: What happened to me is, in <span class="populated place">Vilijampole</span>, where my sister in <span class="populated place">Vilijampole</span>, where my sister lived was the heart of the Jewish poor population in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="402">The popularity -- the population -- was mostly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="403">All the great famous <span class="building">yeshivas</span> were there. </sentence><sentence id="404">And when the war broke out, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the <span class="populated place">villages</span>, in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and in other <span class="populated place">villages</span>, because the <span class="region">fronts</span> were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="405">But the civil Russian popula-- government in every <span class="populated place">community</span>, including <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and <span class="populated place">Vilijampolis</span>, disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war, which was the night of June 21st, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="406">In those three days and three nights, with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day. </sentence><sentence id="407">All the functionaries of the Russian government and Party had their <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and their <span class="spatial object">buses</span> and other means of transportation stacked away somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="408">And when it happened, they all packed up their families and they left. </sentence><sentence id="409">And the population was left without any mercy at all. </sentence><sentence id="410">And it's the Lithuanian fascists, who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, secretly, by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="411">So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might, the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists (ph), I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities, they were within one half an hour in uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="412">And they marched in in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>; and they murdered the most brutal, the

a week and a half, about a week prior to the start of the war. </sentence><sentence id="422">She called me that there's a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and my name was put

class="country">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="424">There was no way of telling who will be next to go. </sentence><sentence id="425">Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with everybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly imprisoned by the Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="426">And he was a, a -- and his

support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned political prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="428">I gave to everybody generously, so she knew exactly who I was. </sentence><sentence id="429">And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as a human being. </sentence><sentence id="430">And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to <span class="region">Siberia</span>. </sentence><sentence

also was advised by inside information that it's not healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of the <span class="building">retail outlets</span>. </sentence><sentence id="435">I became the <span class="building">prekiau</span> (ph) zinaviets (ph) -- the merchandise specialist. </sentence><sentence id="436">So she suggested to me I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I didn't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="437">I called him in his <span class="building">office</span>, I made an appointment with him the same day to have dinner with him in a <span class="building">restaurant</span>. </sentence><sentence id="438">I explained to him that I don't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="439">I happen physically to suffer from psoriasis. </sentence><sentence id="440">And all I had to do is unroll my sleeve and scratch a little in my, in my, in my <span class="region">joint area</span> that

most luxury <span class="region">resort area</span> in <span class="country">Russia</span>, where Stalin personally had one of his <span class="building">villas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="444">And I certainly shivered away from that. </sentence><sentence id="445">The next place was <span class="populated place">Druskininkai</span>, a <span class="region">resort area</span>, a very famous <span class="region">resort area</span> which belonged to <span class="country">Lithuania</span> five hundred years ago at the time when <span class="country">Lithuania</span> ruled a great

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="547">Q: When the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took over <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, everybody in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to make themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="550"> 1 Rider pants, whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="551">So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with high boots, with Stalinuvka"? ( </sentence><sentence id="552">ph) jackets. </sentence><sentence id="553">And at the time when Molotov's speech was delivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a mad situation. </sentence><sentence id="554">And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go. </sentence><sentence id="555">And I immediately decided that I will start to escape in the only <span class="dlf">highway road</span> which was near the <span class="region">resort area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="556">And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots to look like a commissar. </sentence><sentence id="557">And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled, and I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="558">I walked for an hour this way. </sentence><sentence id="559">While passing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a <span class="dlf">water well</span>. </sentence><sentence id="560">And thousands of people were laying around the <span class="dlf">water well</span>, hanging around. </sentence><sentence id="561">There was a <span class="building">school</span> of Russian students. </sentence><sentence id="562">I don't remember what kind of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="563">It was a <span class="building">vocational school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="564">And the boys who were who were taking out the <span class="env feature">water</span> from the well wore uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="565">And the thousands of people had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water. </sentence><sentence id="566">I had some <span class="dlf">properties</span> with me, and in the <span class="dlf">properties</span> I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds. </sentence><sentence id="567">I prepared myself for that kind of even-eventuality in many situations. </sentence><sentence id="568">In, in a <span class="spatial object">dry shaving soap container</span>, like a little, like a little <span class="spatial object">roller</span>. </sentence><sentence id="569">And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the boys; and within two seconds, I got the <span class="env feature">water</span>. </sentence><sentence id="570">And I continued. </sentence><sentence id="571">Daybreak came, and by then I was half-dead. </sentence><sentence id="572">I couldn't walk anymore. </sentence><sentence id="573">I was on a <span class="dlf">field</span> where thousands of people were laying stretched out on the <span class="dlf">field</span>, already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="574">And the <span class="spatial object">German airplanes</span> came flying over the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="575">And a lot of people were shoving themselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer to the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="576">And it just so happened that by then I was near a <span class="dlf">road</span> where thousands of refugees were running towards <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="577">That <span class="dlf">highway</span> was closer to <span class="country">Russia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="578">Those <span class="dlf">borders</span>, in those days, the, the, the, the <span class="region">national territories</span> that a little, a little <span class="dlf">highway</span>, a little <span class="dlf">road</span> -- here was <span class="country">Poland</span>, five seconds later it was <span class="country">Ukrainia</span>, and, and a little bit further it was <span class="country">Byelorussia</span>. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was all part of the same <span class="region">territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="580">So I happened to be lying near the, the <span class="dlf">route</span>, near the <span class="dlf">road</span>, where a Jewish family with a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>, with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, and men were walking with the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="581">And one of the women noticed me. </sentence><sentence id="582">And she started to cry and forced the man to put me on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="583">And on the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, they bandaged my feet and powdered it. </sentence><sentence id="584">And I recuperated. </sentence><sentence id="585">And after traveling all day and almost a half a night, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us. </sentence><sentence id="586">Finally we land up a <span class="populated place">village</span> in <span class="country">Ukraine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="587">We were in a <span class="building">barn</span> of a, of a <span class="building">Ukrainian farmer house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="588">It was then already forbidden by Jews to take in wandering Jews. </sentence><sentence id="589">So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy in the <span class="populated place">village</span> robbing the Jewish properties. </sentence><sentence id="591">And the old man -- he must have been eighty, ninety years old -- stood for hours in the <span class="dlf">doorway</span> of his <span class="building">barn</span> where we were laying, with a, with a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be  2 finished robbing the <span class="building">Jewish houses</span> in the <span class="populated place">village</span> and when they will come back <span class="building">home</span> to stop them from going in in the <span class="building">barn</span> and kill us and take away the properties what those people had with whom I was attached. </sentence><sentence id="592">I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was nothing to take from me. </sentence><sentence id="593">All they could do is kill me. </sentence><sentence id="594">After we left this <span class="dlf">property</span>, we continued riding further and further and further. </sentence><sentence id="595">And we didn't manage to go very far, where we stopped at another <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="596">And I, I was relaxed already and almost everything in my foot healed, except one <span class="region">area</span> which was bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="597">And I was sitting in the front of the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="598">I think the <span class="building">house</span>, the people in the <span class="building">house</span> what made me do something in the front -- clean a <span class="spatial object">pot</span>, I don't remember what. </sentence><sentence id="599">And a group of German soldiers stopped and asked me, "Du Jude?"!(r) And I said, "Jude." </sentence><sentence id="600">And they took me with them. </sentence><sentence id="601">They took me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking <span class="building">residence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="602">And it was vacant, and they made me scrub the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="603">It was the <span class="building">headquarters</span> for the commanding general to stopover when he will arrive. </sentence><sentence id="604">They were preparing the <span class="building">headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="605">And since one of the guards noticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot. </sentence><sentence id="606">In the meantime, he bought something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="607">And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back to the place where they picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="608">By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the <span class="dlf">routes</span> were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="609">So the family, the family from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="610">And it took us several days. </sentence><sentence id="611">And we arrived in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="612">Shortly before we came to the proper <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic. </sentence><sentence id="613">And they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us straight to the <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="614">And from there, they kept us for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="615">And since the whole family was in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, resident family, they let them all go -- including me. </sentence><sentence id="616">So I stayed for a few days with that family. </sentence><sentence id="617">Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="618">And then I -- they told me -- I spoke no Polish. </sentence><sentence id="619">So the family with whom I was staying discovered that there are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get passes to go back to their <span class="building">homes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="620">Where do you have that many thousands of refugees?Because <span class="populated place">Druskininkai</span>, the <span class="region">resort area</span> where I was, was a <span class="region">resort area</span> only for, for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="621">There were dozens of <span class="building">hotels</span> only for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="622">And there were many other <span class="building">resort hotels</span> in that <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="623">So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and employees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war. </sentence><sentence id="624">And they all lined up in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, in the front of the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span> to get passes to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">And I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="626">The procedure was: there was a big <span class="dlf">street</span>, no traffic, it was blocked off; across the <span class="dlf">street</span> of the <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>, the thousands of people were staying and waiting in <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="627">There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the people. </sentence><sentence id="628">And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>, that means they took care of their business. </sentence><sentence id="629">The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to go in. </sentence><sentence id="630">Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't designate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. </sentence><sentence id="631">So the guards  3 were controlling the outside. </sentence><sentence id="632">They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more. </sentence><sentence id="633">And the rest of them went back. </sentence><sentence id="634">That repeated itself several times a day. </sentence><sentence id="635">I was there for one day, and I think a second day. </sentence><sentence id="636">After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="637">And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and they made a set of Star of Davids for me, too. </sentence><sentence id="638">So the next morning, six o'clock in the morning, I arrived at the, at the <span class="building">line-up place</span>, already with my <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span>. </sentence><sentence id="639">I am not a tall person. </sentence><sentence id="640">And between the husky big people without the <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span>, I would never had a opportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups of people arrived to wait for the police. </sentence><sentence id="641">A day passed by. </sentence><sentence id="642">Although nobody ever attempted to offend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to get in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it. </sentence><sentence id="643">And one day, I think, two days passed by. </sentence><sentence id="644">Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the other people, the German guard walked over to me and said, "Du, Jude, komm.""" </sentence><sentence id="645">And he walked me through the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, and while walking he said to me, "Die Schweine, die, die, die Russians! </sentence><sentence id="646">Ich hab gesehen was ist -- was angeht, und du

</sentence><sentence id="846">And she happened to be the sister of the Lithuanian chief of the organized partisan murderous bands, who were busy in that time not to bother with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="847">Because in the <span class="populated place">Polish Ukrainian villages</span>, the Lithuanian partisans who take over the power  6 immediately were busy antagonizing or robbing or murdering the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="848">They had not -- they didn't have to bother with the Jews, because the Jews wouldn't run away from them. </sentence><sentence id="849">They had time plenty for the Jews later on. </sentence><sentence id="850">But her brother was the head of the organizers of the murderous partisan bands, who for participated in most of the destructive murders of <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> -- including <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>, primarily <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="851">Where if I would have been there, what I started to explain you originally. </sentence><sentence id="852">By all counts I should have been there. </sentence><sentence id="853">But because physically I happened to be in <span class="populated place">Druskininkai</span>, so I wasn't murdered. </sentence><sentence id="854">So he brought me in his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: Then they gave me to eat and to drink, and they gave me some clothing. </sentence><sentence id="910">And he was getting ready to send a <span class="spatial object">transport</span> of additional murderers to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, to continue with the beautiful work they did. </sentence><sentence id="911">And he instructed them to put me in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> and to take me to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="912">After all, I was his custody. </sentence><sentence id="913">And he instructed them, and he had told me, that on the <span class="dlf">highway</span> they will be stopped by a German officer who was the real head chief of the, of the, of the <span class="building">Einsatzkommando</span>."" </sentence><sentence id="914">And he will give them additional instructions in writing and will converse with them. </sentence><sentence id="915">The German didn't speak Lithuanian, and the Lithuanian didn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="916">But he will give them instructions what, additional instructions what to do in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="917">Prior to this stop, where he was supposed to wait for them, the soldiers should put me underneath their feet between the <span class="spatial object">benches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">The <span class="spatial object">truck</span> had <span class="spatial object">benches</span> arranged for people to sit. </sentence><sentence id="919">And they should cover me up with their feet. </sentence><sentence id="920">And he explained me, too -- or his sister explained me -- that it will be stopped, and a German officer will talk German. </sentence><sentence id="921">I should not breath or make any sign of anything. </sentence><sentence id="922">I should stay still. </sentence><sentence id="923">And I did, and they passed by. </sentence><sentence id="924">The trip was a pretty long trip. </sentence><sentence id="925">It was almost a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="926">Towards the evening, they stopped in the front of a, of a <span class="building">farmhouse</span>, or a <span class="building">restaurant</span>, where they all went in to eat. </sentence><sentence id="927">And they took me in, too, and I ate with them. </sentence><sentence id="928">When they arrived in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, on <span class="dlf">Vilna Street</span> -- one of the main <span class="dlf">streets</span> -- they just let me off. </sentence><sentence id="929">I'm finished. </sentence><sentence id="930">I'm finished, I -- their duty was over. </sentence><sentence id="931">That <span class="building">house</span> was not far of the <span class="building">house</span> where my brother-in-law's brother was living. </sentence><sentence id="932">So I walked in in that <span class="building">house</span>, in their <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="933">And there I find my sister with her two children, and my mother, from <span class="populated place">Jonava</span>, with a niece of mine -- the one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="934">And there they -- I discovered the whole the whole story what happened. </sentence><sentence id="935">I would have been in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>, in my sister's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="936">And they avoid that the brutal murder of the pogroms on the first three days. </sentence><sentence id="937">On the fourth day, a group of partisans, murderous, decided to go and check out from <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="938">My sister happened to have lived in a <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="939">So the eight, nine men who were hiding were up there in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span> -- my brother-in-law, his brother, his son and other people -- they're hiding in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="940">It was not the straight down <span class="dlf">roof</span> where you could fold up. </sentence><sentence id="941">It was a <span class="dlf">attic roof</span> like <span class="region">areas</span> were straight, where people could lay down there. </sentence><sentence id="942">After they didn't find anybody, they all walked out. </sentence><sentence id="943">And some of the idiots inside decided to look from, on the  7 <span class="interior space">balcony</span>, decided to look if it's all over. </sentence><sentence id="944">And the last partisan decided to look up, and they met each other. </sentence><sentence id="945">And they took them all down, and they took them to the <span class="building">Ninth Fortification</span>."! </sentence><sentence id="946">And they murdered them, together with most of the Jews that were murdered. </sentence><sentence id="947">You have to remember that this <span class="building">Fortification</span>, the Seventh and the Ninth <span class="building">Fortification</span>, was fortifications -- you know what a <span class="building">fortification</span> is? </sentence><sentence id="948">Built by the <span class="country">Czarist Russia</span> to pretend -- to prevent -- attacks from German armies in, in 1905. </sentence><sentence id="949">And they were still in existence. </sentence><sentence id="950">And the Lithuanian took them over, and that's where they murdered most of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="951">They took them there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: What, what happens to you next, now that you're back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="998">My mother, when I made the trip to <span class="populated place">Druskininkai</span> for a vacation, my mother was living with me. </sentence><sentence id="999">She was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I didn't want my mother to be by herself. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one daughter to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And the first stop she made was in <span class="populated place">Jonava</span>, with my sister who had fou-four children. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their <span class="interior space">apartments</span>, driven to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and they were kept for several days. </sentence><sentence id="1004">My then-70-years-old mother realized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And she grabbed Dinah's (ph) hand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and closer to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1007">They were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the <span class="populated place">ravinas</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1008">Ravina, that's a English word? </sentence><sentence id="1009">Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1010">A woman who couldn't read and write, never went to a <span class="building">school</span>, never know what a map means, managed to go from <span class="populated place">Janova</span> to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And that's how they arrived in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1012">They were hiding during the day, because they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And if there weren't any partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and called over a murderer. </sentence><sentence id="1014">So they arrived in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So I had already a built-in family of my sister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>, with her little girl, Raisele (ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1016">The boy was six years old. </sentence><sentence id="1017">The girl was about 12, 14. </sentence><sentence id="1018">That was three people. </sentence><sentence id="1019">My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So I had five dependents, on whose ability to survive depends on me only. </sentence><sentence id="1021">After a while, the rule came out to go into <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother- in-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days before my arrival. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. </sentence><sentence id="1024">It was on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I decided to walk to the <span class="building">criminal police headquarters</span> to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal police, Mr. Pomatitis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1026">My relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called  8 manager of the new <span class="building">Christian office products store</span> and his <span class="building">office</span> was buying, and he personally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive properties and put in on the invoice "office products" to be sent to his <span class="building">home</span>, it was a personal relationship between him and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Since I wasn't some several times for business, and when I became the employee of the <span class="building">government store</span> <span class="building">retail outlet</span>, after the, the Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the <span class="building">store</span> to buy school supplies for the children. </sentence><sentence id="1028">So she told me that he was imprisoned in the <span class="building">Kovno prison</span>, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So I gave her money to buy the <span class="building">school</span> supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf? -- </sentence><sentence id="1031">help -- to her <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1032">My logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from <span class="building">prison</span> from the Communists, and became again the chief of the <span class="building">police headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, my logic was that she would have told him what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1033">He knew who I am. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see him, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1036">In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I had a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original Lithuanian Army. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button on his--. </sentence><sentence id="1038">With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this. -- </sentence><sentence id="1039">to the chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, quite a distant. </sentence><sentence id="1040">But we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1041">There were thousands of Jews waiting in the <span class="building">offices</span> for appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were waiting for their appointment. </sentence><sentence id="1042">But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr.Jonas Pomatitis, the chief of the <span class="building">police headquarters</span>, within two seconds the assistant of the police, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="1043">He went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the opportunity to come and speak to me. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks it may be too late. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And that's exactly what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1046">It was too late. </sentence><sentence id="1047">On the way back, we were stopped again by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all over. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was still permitted for Jews to walk on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, but you had to have your star already. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Or maybe by then it was not. </sentence><sentence id="1050">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1051">But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who is a Jew in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him away; and they took me to the <span class="building">prison</span>, to the <span class="building">yellow prison</span>, which was nearby. </sentence><sentence id="1053">They kept me there for several hours. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on the <span class="env feature">mountains</span> in a former <span class="building">Russian casere</span>, a <span class="building">military unit</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And they made me sort clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And when the day was over, they sent me back in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then the decree came out that all Jews should go in in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Since we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> to the <span class="interior space">apartment</span> of my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1059">She lived in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>, where it was supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The <span class="dlf">street</span> she lived was supposed to be part of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Before we did that, I decided to go  <span class="populated place">9</span> to my former <span class="interior space">apartment</span> and see if there was anything I could recuperate. </sentence><sentence id="1062">The superintendent of the <span class="building">building</span> was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Nobody persecuted Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1064">The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years. </sentence><sentence id="1065">But the Russian were, were kept neutral. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1067">They were regular Lithuanian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="1068">When I walked in in that <span class="interior space">apartment</span>, a rifle was hanging on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And he explained me, "You see, I can easily take down the rifle and shoot you dead. </sentence><sentence id="1070">But I'm not going to do it." </sentence><sentence id="1071">He returned to me a pair of shoes and some underwear, and a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend was a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from <span class="populated place">Vilna</span> the most luxury <span class="spatial object">Polish furniture</span> that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires. </sentence><sentence id="1073">It was called <span class="building">tonnette (ph) manufacturing</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1074">So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I had. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And after a few days, we moved into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1076">By then, my sister's <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where she lived was not any more designated to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and we had to move in somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together with other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1078">But in the meantime, we were in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1079">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> was not completely closed up by then. </sentence><sentence id="1080">But Jews were constantly moving in. </sentence><sentence id="1081">The German authorities gave us, I think, until August 15th to close in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, where no more, no, no Jews would be in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1082">It should be in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Free should move in in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a Chris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of Kostas (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1085">And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will attack Stalin and overnight we will be finished. </sentence><sentence id="1086">We were prepared that the Russians will take over <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with <span class="country">England</span> and, and <span class="country">France</span>, and nothing will happen in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take over my <span class="country">country</span>, I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand years by having packages of my properties in different <span class="building">houses</span> of different friends, Jewish and non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple years, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Because I figured out exactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I would have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my properties. </sentence><sentence id="1090">When I say "myself," it's not "T" personally.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: The most treasured thing in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> or in <span class="country">Russia</span> was a <span class="spatial object">fountain pen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And the pen, the <span class="spatial object">fountain pen</span>, could not function without that pen. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I came back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I took in with, with the, with the properties. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with all their properties, with the <span class="spatial object">furniture</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Some of them hired transportation -- horse and <span class="spatial object">buggies</span> -- and came into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would bring in in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, they'll get it later. </sentence><sentence id="1242">It was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="1243">The Jewish were not running from them anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But I came in with nothing, with five mouths. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And the first meal you may manage, the second and the third. </sentence><sentence id="1246">What you do with the fourth meal? </sentence><sentence id="1247">So the following day, I immediately walked around the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, where most of the people -- who had everything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be captured to be taken to work. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I was walking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only opportunity, by being at work outside the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, that I may have somehow a possibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family. </sentence><sentence id="1250">That was my motivation. </sentence><sentence id="1251">A young member of the, of the same <span class="interior space">apartment</span> where I lived -- there were several families in one room <span class="interior space">apartment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I think a young couple. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And he followed my footsteps, and he went with me. </sentence><sentence id="1254">After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were captured by Lithuanian guards. </sentence><sentence id="1255">One important factor I forgot to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Can I put it in now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1257">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1261">Maybe I would visit Jonas Petronis, my other Christian real friend, who offered me I should help in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And by then he had a <span class="building">retail book shop</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I thought I would visit him and take up a couple matters with him to discuss. </sentence><sentence id="1264">There was a <span class="dlf">bridge</span> between <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> and <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And when I came near the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> from the Slobod-- from the <span class="region">ghetto side</span>, from the <span class="region">Slobodka side</span> to go to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, there was a Lithuanian unifor-- a Lithuanian guard with a rifle standing there. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I know him standing there, but I didn't know who it was. </sentence><sentence id="1268">When I came closer, he captured me. </sentence><sentence id="1269">He was the son, the Yiddish- speaking son, of the Lithuanian superintendent in the <span class="building">building</span> where the family for whom I worked had purchased with the help of an American brother of the lady, a multi-millionaire, Mr. Israel Matz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1270">So his father was the superintendent in the <span class="building">building</span>; and he was the son of the superintendent -- who spoke Yiddish as good as I, or more better. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And he captured me. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And he shouted to call the guard from the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And who was the guard on the other side? </sentence><sentence id="1274">His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we were, we were on the, on the free side. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And both of them decided in my presence, they were debating should they knock me off, throw me in the <span class="env feature">river</span>, not knock me off. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And both of them decided to let me go back to <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So with that, I, I survived the

my friend to go to look for work and I was captured. </sentence><sentence id="1280">We were taken to shant-- to the <span class="building">military casernes</span> which was a tremendous distant. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We walked. </sentence><sentence id="1282">When we arrived there, we were half-dead. </sentence><sentence id="1283">It was about three, four hundred people altogether. </sentence><sentence id="1284">My friend and I was taken to a huge <span class="building">military barrack home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1285">We were given a, a emer" --a <span class="spatial

were told to take water, and lay down and scrub the <span class="interior space">floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1287">So we did. </sentence><sentence id="1288">We did. </sentence><sentence id="1289">We scrubbed the <span class="interior space">floor</span> until our knees were swollen and bloody. </sentence><sentence id="1290">The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was in charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1291">In the meantime, he murdered up -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't realize. </sentence><sentence id="1292">They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to persuade them not to have them work so hard. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And the slightest request of resentment or opposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them. </sentence><sentence id="1294">I didn't have that case. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and scrubbed. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1297">That affected so much the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the <span class="building">Lithuanian houses</span> and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> for us to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1298">When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived back in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1299">It just so happened that the <span class="building">houses</span> we got, they are the <span class="region">territory</span>, the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the Jewish administration anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1300">But value nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And that's where we got the <span class="building">houses</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So there was a long <span class="env feature">desert</span> to walk, a <span class="region">desert area</span>, a <span class="region">sandy area</span>, to walk to our <span class="interior space">quarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Quiet  2 walk. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving. </sentence><sentence id="1305">When we arrived at the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, there was already a organized a Ghettowache(tm) who were checking the <span class="dlf">gates</span> for the Jewish who came in. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were guarding on the other side, on the inside of the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1307">The cooperation between the murderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty tolerant after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1308">The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to bow and take off the hat. </sentence><sentence id="1309">When we walked in the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span>, we were told to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="1310">If we will meet a German, we should bow and take off our hats if we had. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We didn't have hats then. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So we're walking halfway. </sentence><sentence id="1313">We are starving. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span>, so we didn't walk on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And we were walking already in the <span class="region">desert area</span> when suddenly, from a <span class="dlf">comer street</span>, two guards, two armed German military men came out walking towards us. </sentence><sentence id="1316">When we came close enough to them, we bowed. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And they immediately took down their rifles to shoot at us. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And I immediately figured out what's going on, what their thought was. </sentence><sentence id="1319">If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away because they would understand that I'm running away. </sentence><sentence id="1320">There's no way how I could run away. </sentence><sentence id="1321">So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are good, and the other man followed me. </sentence><sentence id="1322">After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to their presence, we bowed very deep. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And they laughed and walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And then, after a while, we came <span class="building">home</span> and relaxed and, and had a little to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I think the guards -- the Lithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And this way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without waiting to be captured. </sentence><sentence id="1327">That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were waiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> where, where eventually we would have had something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1328">The first day, I was taken to a <span class="building">German military unit</span>, to the <span class="building">PX canteen</span>, to wash the <span class="interior space">floors</span> there and to help put the merchandise on the <span class="spatial object">shelves</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1329">When we arrived there, the manager of the <span class="building">canteen</span> -- the German officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the <span class="building">canteen</span> -- took the two of us in the <span class="interior space">canteen room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1330">The <span class="interior space">canteen room</span> was a little like a <span class="interior space">room</span> as, as, as big as that comer there. </sentence><sentence id="1331">He put the pail of water in the front of the <span class="dlf">door</span>, so when somebody would try to get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there. </sentence><sentence id="1332">He was able to see who would come in. </sentence><sentence id="1333">If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the <span class="dlf">door</span> right away. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the <span class="interior space">floor</span> is wet. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the <span class="dlf">door</span> and he will tell us to remove the <span class="spatial object">pail</span>, we should put the food in a <span class="interior space">corner</span> nobody, not, not to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he invited us for a few more days to come. </sentence><sentence id="1337"> 3 And I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="1338">Then that was over. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in bad <span class="region">areas</span> where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the <span class="building">Third Police Brigade</span> in the center of the most <span class="region">luxury area</span> in, in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And I was working in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And I had enough to food to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people. </sentence><sentence id="1342">By then, it must have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in. </sentence><sentence id="1343">In the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, a great deal of Jewish young men from <span class="populated place">Slobodka ghetto</span> -- it was easy to go to <span class="populated place">Jonava</span> because the <span class="dlf">highway</span> was there. </sentence><sentence id="1344">They're running out every morning to go and get some food. </sentence><sentence id="1345"><span class="populated place">Jordan</span> (ph), the chief murderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered them all. </sentence><sentence id="1346">That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim"* -- decent goyim -- were able to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they murdered them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to go with them and buy food. </sentence><sentence id="1348">I didn't had any money or any clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Immediately thereafter the creation of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, clothing was the commodity to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="1350">I didn't had any. </sentence><sentence id="1351">What my superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a pair of socks, and some underwear. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this murderous onslaught. </sentence><sentence id="1353">When I lined up in the, in the <span class="building">Third Police Precinct</span>, I think by reading the other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaum"" who was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1354">After three, four days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were actually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another. </sentence><sentence id="1355">He gave us the instructions; we did them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with us one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="1357">But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and me on a, on a, on a step on a <span class="interior space">attic</span> in, in one of the <span class="building">houses</span>, and took us over to a <span class="building">commer</span> where two huge sacks of sugar was standing. </sentence><sentence id="1358">He instructed us to take the <span class="spatial object">sacks</span>, to bring them to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1359">I immediately came over to the <span class="spatial object">sack</span> and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get near the <span class="spatial object">sack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And the other guy started to argue with him. </sentence><sentence id="1361">It's too heavy for him. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So he told me, "Stay here." </sentence><sentence id="1363">He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed the sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him <span class="interior space">upstairs</span>, dragged my sack and they came down. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even, even, even wrap around the <span class="spatial object">sack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And that was the end of the incident. </sentence><sentence id="1366">After a while, it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> working. </sentence><sentence id="1367">The best <span class="spatial object">units</span> were in the <span class="region">area</span> where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete population was filled up with Lithuanians. </sentence><sentence id="1368">They immediately took over the luxury  4 <span class="interior space">apartments</span> from the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering food for clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1370">And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their slaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1371">It was going on a, a <span class="building">business</span> like a regular <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1373">But the <span class="building">black marketeers</span>, to them bring in food was not such a big thing. </sentence><sentence id="1374">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. </sentence><sentence id="1375">You know what saccharine is? </sentence><sentence id="1376">Sweeteners. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Or sugar or fat or butter. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="1379">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian Wachmeister"(r) who was a tall, slim person. </sentence><sentence id="1381">By five o'clock in the afternoon, the <span class="dlf">street</span> to enter <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> after a day's work. </sentence><sentence id="1382">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the <span class="building">black marketeers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1383">I had a contract in the <span class="building">work brigade</span>, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1384">He was extremely strong, powerful man. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to bring in in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> , by then a lot of people who were brought in some food were already starving. </sentence><sentence id="1387">So by then it was already seven, eight months, or five, six months in the existence of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And things changed dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the <span class="building">black marketeers</span> to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. </sentence><sentence id="1391">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. </sentence><sentence id="1392">He didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1393">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1394">If you had barley or any other, or any other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no value. </sentence><sentence id="1395">He didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1396">But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and chocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So I had a contract with <span class="building">Chaimke Lipschitz</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1398">I was buying a big sack of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I couldn't even move the <span class="spatial object">sack</span> from the, from the, from the spot where I bought it. </sentence><sentence id="1400">Chaimke, it was after the <span class="dlf">line-up</span> to go to work, Chaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I had my niece waiting with a little <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>, with a little <span class="spatial object">dolly</span> -- and dropped it in the <span class="spatial object">dolly</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both sides of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, inside of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and after the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, after Jewish walked in there were two <span class="dlf">lines</span> of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Among them was the famous writer, Joseph Garr (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1404">Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Because it was my human duty to give it to them. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And the rest of it was easy to haul with a little more simply, with a little <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, to my <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And there my neighbors got, and my family got. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine. </sentence><sentence id="1409">And there was five hundred saccharine in each <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1410">That product, brought in in <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, was  5 converted to millions, probably, in that time. </sentence><sentence id="1411">You could have gotten twenty-five <span class="spatial object">suits</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1412">You could have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1413">So I was carried this -- the <span class="spatial object">box</span> was not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin. </sentence><sentence id="1414">So I was carrying under my arm, and dancing like a prima donna with that little <span class="spatial object">box</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1415">Except one thing. </sentence><sentence id="1416">You do realize that if I were caught with that little <span class="spatial object">box</span> getting in the <span class="dlf">gate</span>, I would have been brutally beaten up and shot right there on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1596">A: One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured and taken to <span class="building">units</span> outside

</sentence><sentence id="1601">I was taken to the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1602">A Jewish woman by the name of Luba, who was working there already, took me to the <span class="building">barn</span>, pointed her finger to a big shovel and a broom and an axe and a saw to saw <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and told me to clean the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1605">Luba was the maid for the Commandant. </sentence><sentence id="1606">The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter. </sentence><sentence id="1607">He was there every

was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in <span class="populated place">Vienna</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And while I worked the first day and cleaned the <span class="interior space">toilets</span> and cleaned out everything - - the <span class="dlf">street</span>, the, the, the, the <span class="dlf">yard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1612">I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main maids of the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed my family and several other families. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Because this is the <span class="building">outlet</span> that I have the opportunity to get food. </sentence><sentence id="1614">After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was through by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt buckles and the belts of the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1615">The <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span> contained of about seven, eight individual story combined <span class="building">barracks</span> with two <span

all the confiscated food that was taken away from the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade, <span class="building">working brigades</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1619">And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of separating, to bring in almost all the food in the <span class="interior space">bedroom</span> of the Commandant

</sentence><sentence id="1623">I had made arrangements with him. </sentence><sentence id="1624">He  7 was sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the <span class="dlf">window</span>

and gave it to the next, until it land up in the precinct. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And there, the Commandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the merchandise was taken away and returned to them. </sentence><sentence id="1628">After a while, Commandant Ritter instructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in from the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their <span class="spatial object">shopping bags</span>, which was confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="1629">So they should be able to get in return their own <span class="dlf">properties</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1630">All, all the Gestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from <span class="populated

everything for them. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Also, the food for the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span> -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the confiscated food. </sentence><sentence id="1634">After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was returning the food to the Jews, the <span class="populated place">Lithuanian Ghettowache</span> started to mumble that they don't have enough food. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And where would they have enough food? </sentence><sentence id="1636">Because some of the food was returned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1637">The <span class="building">Wache</span> was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the <span class="building">German Ghettowache</span> was hanging on the premises because the duty around the <span class="dlf">fences</span> was only for two hours. </sentence><sentence id="1638">After the two hours, they were free for four hours. </sentence><sentence id="1639">They couldn't possibly go <span class="building">home</span> and then come back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1640">It was not enough time for them to go <span class="building">home</span> and then come back on duty. </sentence><sentence id="1641">So they were laying around in the outer <span class="building">barracks</span> recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and do any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty. </sentence><sentence id="1642">In order to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who would come into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> to catch what I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="1643">Because if it would have been discovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Commandant Ritter would have been the first to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1645">For the period of the time when I was bringing in the food in his <span

class="dlf">lawn</span> up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer- exercise. </sentence><sentence id="1646">Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Some of them were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And the only time when I walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the <span class="dlf">yard</span>, that was the signal to him that it's all over, and he released them. </sentence><sentence id="1649">That was going on for two days. </sentence><sentence id="1650">After that Tschich came, and he was for two days. </sentence><sentence id="1651">Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never harmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he, if he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will shot me right there and then. </sentence><sentence id="1652">And I followed his rule. </sentence><sentence id="1653">He never caught me returning anything and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1654">When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and peeling potatoes and cleaning the <span class="interior space">latrines</span>, I was shining the buckles and the boots. </sentence><sentence id="1655">You can be assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant Ritter's. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And his buckle -- so was his buckle. </sentence><sentence id="1657">I had invented a special invention. </sentence><sentence id="1658">I took a  8 glass, a empty glass. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the <span class="spatial object">boot</span> and the buckle, let it dry out for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom side of the glass I circular rubbed all away. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world would have had such a beautiful shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1662">After a while -- I think it was about four or five months -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole <span class="spatial object">unit</span> -- the whole <span class="building">unit</span> moved away. </sentence><sentence id="1663">And a new <span class="spatial object">unit</span> came in. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And the commandant of that new <span class="building">unit</span> was a German by the name of Schultz. </sentence><sentence id="1665">He did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except he instructed me something else. </sentence><sentence id="1666">At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volkskiiche" -- a <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day free of charge. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And that <span class="dlf">volksktiche</span> needed food to cook. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And there was a former Hebrew teacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> with the food, and they took away. </sentence><sentence id="1670">After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again, under the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the <span class="building">Third Precinct</span>, <span class="building">Police Precinct</span>, Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that <span class="building">Schulgasser</span> should have a second horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> similar to the first horse. </sentence><sentence id="1671">If the first horse was a white horse, so the second one should be a white horse. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And stay a distant away. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And when he was filled up with the first one and the first one came out from the territory of the <span class="region">Ghettowache territory</span>, to bring in the second one and filling in the second one. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Schultz, at the time when it became already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke"" is coming to liquidate the <span

class="country">Russia</span>, and when the German armies were stepping back toward <span class="country">Germany</span>, he was liquidating <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> after <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> after <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1676">At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of liquidating the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, I was helping sew a rucksack for the Commandant Schultz to put in Luba's blonde four, five years old boy and carry him over through the <span class="dlf">gates</span> at night with the flashlight of the signals. </sentence><sentence id="1677">They had flashlights with three different colors, that there was a signal, a specia-- a separate signal that the commandant is going, to better to go climb through the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and take the baby in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, where one of the Lithuanian guards -- they are by then already in the beginning of "44, 1944, even some of the worst murde-- Lithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already for a ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1678">So one of the Lithuanians offered to survive and Luba's son, and the Commandant Schultz carried over personally the son to the Lithuanian's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1679">After a short period of time, the <span class="building">Ghettowache</span> disappeared, and a new <span class="building">Ghettowache</span> arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And they didn't have anymore the <span class="interior space">quarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1681">They had the <span class="interior space">quarters</span> already in  9 a <span class="building">school</span>, in a former <span class="building">school</span> outside the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> which is about 15, 20 minutes by, by <span class="spatial object">car</span> away from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1682">There I was again called in to be the slave of the, of the <span class="interior space">Ghettowache kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1683">It was the unit of <span class="building">Obersturmbannfiihrer Goethe -- Goecke</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1684">It was the unit of the <span

converted the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> to a Kon, to a <span class="building">Konzentrationslager</span>"" <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And the restrictions became extremely severe for the Jews in every <span class="interior space">level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I and all the other slaves for the <span

place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1688">By then it was a big <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the <span class="building">brigade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1690">And while they were there, they were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers, for the <span class="building">Ghettowache</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1691">The, the chef of the <span class="interior

head of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1694">The chef was somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And he was the direct boss of Luba and Esther, and direct my boss. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I continued with the same duties of cleaning the <span class="interior space">toilets</span>, cleaning the <span class="interior space">rooms</span>, peeling potatoes, peeling beans for the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, and all other manual labor work. </sentence><sentence id="1697">In addition to that, Wagner was one of the, of the <span class="building">PX</span> managers. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And he had a <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, and he constantly instructed me to clean his <span class="spatial

class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Well, about 15 blocks further was the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span>, the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And it was the low, lower <span class="dlf">gate</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1702">The <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> had two <span class="dlf">entrances</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1703">By then, they built a second <span class="dlf">entrance</span> which was closer to the <span class="building">school</span> where the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span> was located. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And there, there was a constant guard standing with a rifle on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> of the, of the walking <span class="dlf">entrance</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And any time Goecke was about to arrive about one o'clock in the afternoon, that guard was giving signals that Goecke is arriving. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And with those signals, even high ranking officers of the SS attempted, if they could, to shy away from the premises, because nobody wanted to stumble into <span class="populated place">Goecke</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1707">The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to the, to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span> was Unter-- Oberscharfiihrer Blaufuchs, the head of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, because he was putting food in his

anything. </sentence><sentence id="1711">I didn't want to go out and, and, and do business on the <span class="building">black market</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1712">As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin-- Jewish Judenrat(r) -- they're coming to the <span class="populated place">Wache</span> to, to beg and to buy themselves food. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Because every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the <span class="building">airport</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1714">And a lot of people who worked on the <span class="building">airport</span> get passes to go to the other work brigades, in order to be able to get themselves food; because the <span class="building">airport</span> slave labor was the real slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And the whole existence of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> depended on the <span class="dlf">airports</span>. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1720">And I walked out outside of the <span class="dlf">gates</span>, outside of the premises, in the next <span class="building">gentile house</span>, <span

I never did, but to do somebody a very important favor, I did walk out. </sentence><sentence id="1721">The premises of the, of the, of the, of the <span class="building">school</span> was that on the

</sentence><sentence id="1722">And the <span class="dlf">gate</span> was constantly open to <span class="dlf">driving entrance</span>, because there was a danger the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1724">So it was constantly open. </sentence><sentence id="1725">I walked out to that <span class="building">house</span> next to, close enough to the <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1731">I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the inside. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And I run to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1733">I pushed with my foot. </sentence><sentence id="1734">I start running. </sentence><sentence id="1735">They shoot at me, but they didn't got me. </sentence><sentence

with the child. </sentence><sentence id="1766">They were taking children. </sentence><sentence id="1767">The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the three big <span class="building">brick buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1768">They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian murderers were going up to the <span class="interior space">third floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1769">It was a <span class="building">three story building</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1770">They were finding children on the <span class="interior space">top floor</span>, and dropping them down through the <span class="dlf">window</span> to the Ukrainian or Lithuanian guard who was standing downstairs on the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And he picked them up and knocked his head on the <span class="dlf">wall</span>, choking up, until the child was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1772">The German Wachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman was find in a <span class="spatial object">toilet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1773">The <span class="interior space">toilets</span> were <span class="building">wooden house</span>, wooden bungalows-like. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And she was hiding, and it was almost all over. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it is all over and the Gestapo man saw her. </sentence><sentence id="1776">They were walking with big sticks exactly for that purpose, with wide, with wide handles. </sentence><sentence id="1777">My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick had special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that. </sentence><sentence id="1778">So the Wachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the stick on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> until she was dead before she was thrown in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1779">When I came back after, when they started to liquidate the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and brought me back in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, my sister told me that that old lady was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1780">That's the way she was, she was taken out. </sentence><sentence id="1781">At the start of the liquidation of <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, the last few days Goecke, personally, and, and, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him. </sentence><sentence id="1782">In the book their whole names, but it's not important for us. </sentence><sentence id="1783">They, personally, they're driving around the <span class="region">areas</span> where groups of young people they're trying to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Everybody knew it's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And they caught them and shot them on the <span class="dlf">streets</span>, on the <span class="dlf">field</span> -- wherever they caught them -- without any mercy. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Immediately, they murdered them. </sentence><sentence id="1787">I was brought in in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, back in <span class="populated place">KZ Kovno</span>, back to be prepared for the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1788">But then they sent in a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service. </sentence><sentence id="1789">They needed to prepare straw, <span class="spatial object">straw mattresses</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="1790">And I was called in with the other former workers  2 to prepare the <span class="spatial object">sacks</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="1791">In those days they were <span class="building">building</span> -- there was a <span class="building">barn</span> where the <span class="env feature">wood</span> was located, and all the tools. </sentence><sentence id="1792">It was old rotten wood. </sentence><sentence id="1793">They were building new <span class="building">barracks</span> up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out and, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through. </sentence><sentence id="1794">So I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days before the liquidation of our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, attempted to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1795">We attempted to dig out in the <span class="region">side</span> that was still rotten. </sentence><sentence id="1796">You pull it out from under the <span class="env feature">earth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1797">You dug out the <span class="env feature">earth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And there was a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1799">He had already his family outside, and he had prepared his place for himself outside. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And when he noticed that, he came to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and informed on us. </sentence><sentence id="1801">So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and Wagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who would see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1802">It was not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1803">There was a guard, <span class="building">Schmittus</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1804">One of the guards was a man by the name of Schmittus. </sentence><sentence id="1805">I was told that he was a Ger--a, a, a, Ger, a Volksdeutsche"" in <span class="populated

the Nazis recognized Volksdeutsche as Deutsche(tm)(r). </sentence><sentence id="1808">Some of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people -- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Probably amongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. </sentence><sentence id="1810">Schmittus tried, made so many efforts to help me. </sentence><sentence id="1811">Schmittus was constantly arguing with <span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> against the treatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1812">But he was arguing with the wrong person, because <span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. </sentence><sentence id="1813">The day before we were liqui-- before we were taken back to <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, and few days before the total liquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. </sentence><sentence id="1814">His <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> was standing in the front of the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1815">The <span class="dlf">entrance</span> of the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> was here, and the open <span class="dlf">gates</span> to drive in was here. </sentence><sentence id="1816">And Goecke, when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the other <span class="dlf">wall</span>, turn around, faced his <span class="spatial object">car</span> to get out, and walked to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1817">So Wagner told me to clean his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="1818">It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect Goecke to come to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1819">He had his own <span class="building">headquarters</span> in, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and he had his own <span class="building">headquarters</span> in the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1820">He used to come to that, to the <span class="building">guard unit</span> only for dinner, for, for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And it was about 11 o'clock in the morning, or 11:30, when nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come. </sentence><sentence id="1822">The guard who was constantly stationed on the, on the front of the main <span class="dlf">street</span> with the <span class="dlf">sidewalk entrance</span> was a, a, a, a -- also a <span class="building">Volksdeutsche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1823">A little confused human being, you know, but a very decent person. </sentence><sentence id="1824">We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer -- he should knock on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> with the rifle and shout twice, "Yaveh (ph) v'yavo""." </sentence><sentence id="1825"> 3 That's the Hebrew words: "He comes, he's here." </sentence><sentence id="1826">And when he shout, he couldn't pronounce both words, but "Yahveh" he remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="1827">But when he shouted, "Yahveh!" </sentence><sentence id="1828">everything disappeared from the, from the <span class="region">front area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1829">That day he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1830">Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And Wagner told me to clean his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars of David on the front and the back in order not to make dirty, and I took the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1833">I was walking with the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> from the <span class="region">area</span> where Wagner gave it to me towards the, towards the <span class="building">barn</span>, where I had my tools. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And I passed by the <span

</sentence><sentence id="1836">Gets out of the <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1837">Walks over to me. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Pulls out a gun. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And he was ready to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And I, and I stood up like a military person. </sentence><sentence id="1841">I clicked my feet. </sentence><sentence id="1842">I was wearing <span class="spatial object">galoshes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1843">In July, I was wearing <span class="spatial object">galoshes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1844">But I made movement like I'm clicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, "Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke! </sentence><sentence id="1845">Das ist nicht mein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine <span class="spatial object">Star of David</span> habe. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Der Wagner verlangte ich soll sein <span class="spatial object">Fahrrad</span> saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe Stern ... hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem <span class="spatial object">Fahrrad</span> zu der <span class="spatial

within, in, in that moment, <span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> was already near him. </sentence><sentence id="1849">That's the only person whom he'll listen to. </sentence><sentence id="1850">Wagner was on the other side, and other high ranking SS officers. </sentence><sentence id="1851">There was a new man who came a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="1852">He probably was the head of the transportation. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was not attempting to escape with the <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I was just going to the other <span class="region">area</span> to clean it. </sentence><sentence id="1855">It, it took minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, "Verschwinden!" </sentence><sentence id="1856">And I immediately "verschwind." </sentence><sentence id="1857">You know what ""verschwind" is -- disappear. </sentence><sentence id="1858">And I disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1859">He went to have lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1860">He walked out from his lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1861"><span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> was right behind him. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And he shouted, "Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!"""*" </sentence><sentence id="1863">And I immediately was there standing, like, like, like "Attention!" </sentence><sentence id="1864">And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the "Blaue Jacke ist beschlagnahmt."" </sentence><sentence id="1865">It's confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="1866">And again shouted to me, "Andreten!"*? </sentence><sentence id="1867">And I walked away, and he drove away. </sentence><sentence id="1868">And the same day, we were taken back to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and it started the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1869"> 4 I arrived Saturday night back in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, never to go back to the, to the <span class="building">Ghettowache</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1870">I slept over the night. </sentence><sentence id="1871">I, I had my niece then. </sentence><sentence id="1872">My mother and the baby, Alenke was already murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1873">By the way, people told me when <span class="building">IJ</span> arrived in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that that was the day when Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total of six, seven people per group. </sentence><sentence id="1874">About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And that's when they permitted me to be saved from <span class="populated place">Goecke</span>, in a situation like that. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Couldn't happen in a million years anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1877">And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch us and to put us in a <span class="interior space">cage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1878">Shortly before I left the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, two or three weeks before, to to and never came to come back to work for the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span>, I noticed that Jewish were <span class="building">building</span> near the <span class="dlf">Kaisergasse</span> (ph), a <span class="dlf">gate</span> --a, a, a <span class="dlf">fence</span>, a fenced a, a, a <span class="dlf">wire fence</span>, a wire bu-- a <span class="dlf">wire partition</span> like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the <span class="dlf">field</span> in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the new guards. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And -- no, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be happened, and my niece to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="1883">But she got permission to go in a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> which one of the most prominent Jewish people build. </sentence><sentence id="1884">She was a friend of the man's wife, and they permitted her to stay until. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And we figured it's only for three or four days, and in three or four days Russians were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name -- came out from the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> and invited me, too. </sentence><sentence id="1888">I am a, I am a breathing difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I was then, and I am today. </sentence><sentence id="1890">So after being there for a couple of seconds, the <span class="building">bunker</span> was built for maybe 12, 14 people. </sentence><sentence id="1891">By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already -- I was already the 67th or the 68th. </sentence><sentence id="1892">It was burning hot in July. </sentence><sentence id="1893">It was the first week in July, so how long could I have stayed in that place? </sentence><sentence id="1894">After a few seconds, I started to cough and I got out. </sentence><sentence id="1895">I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1896">Somehow, she listened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And we were captured right away on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and put in the enclosed <span class="dlf">wire fence</span> that was fenced. </sentence><sentence id="1898">We were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="1899">People were stepping on each other already. </sentence><sentence id="1900">We were laying there for three days and three nights. </sentence><sentence id="1901">On the second day, the transportation of the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> took place in three groups. </sentence><sentence id="1902">The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. </sentence><sentence id="1903">They went out, and they were taken to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The second group was my <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1905">But the Jewish that they find on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they lined them up and safely under the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1906">But they were going with Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from <span class="building">building</span>, <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>, fish out the people in the hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And there, the woman were laying nude just in a <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and the men were practically nude, and brought them all to the to the <span class="building">encampment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1908">So from an <span class="region">area</span> that it could house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people concentrated. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And it became a tremendous situation. </sentence><sentence id="1910">You had to do your bowel movements right there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And the stink from the smell from the <span class="interior space">bowels</span> was not to be believed. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I think we were laying there for three, four days or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to go to the, to the <span class="spatial object">train</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person  5 over the people to look for "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1914">I am "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1915">I am David. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And when he find, "Who would know is "the <span class="building">David</span>"?" </sentence><sentence id="1917">Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they called "the David." </sentence><sentence id="1918">There must have been fifty Davids there. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Who would know? </sentence><sentence id="1920">He finally find me. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they wake us all up to march out. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And at that time, I should try to be the very last <span class="dlf">line</span>, and I instructed my niece to be the very one with me. </sentence><sentence id="1923">And other people who were near me, I instructed them the same way. </sentence><sentence id="1924">He said, by being the very last <span class="dlf">line</span>, he and Wagner and two other additional people will close up the <span class="dlf">line</span> of guards. </sentence><sentence id="1925">They will be the last guards. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And as soon as they get out from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, I should escape. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at me. </sentence><sentence id="1928">But they wouldn't shoot at me. </sentence><sentence id="1929">I should keep running. </sentence><sentence id="1930">I instructed my sister, my niece to do that, too. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I was ready to two eventualities. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I wanted to escape anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1933">I was ready, I hoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1934">Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee; or while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. </sentence><sentence id="1935">Without pain, I'll be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1936">I happened to walk out Sunday morning in a clean, bright shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And while laying the few days in the <span class="dlf">field</span>, I find the brother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And I exchanged with him. </sentence><sentence id="1939">I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I, I, I had a silly logic that if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="1941">The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I had a <span class="spatial object">German bag</span>, a <span class="spatial object">bread bag</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1943">It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of bread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1944">I was ready to escape, to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1945">That's all I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1946">I felt I'll never wind up in <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1947">And I instructed my niece to do that, too. </sentence><sentence id="1948">When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early in the morning, I tried to be the last <span class="dlf">line</span>, and I was about in the last <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1949">I was about the closest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private <span class="building">house</span> garden. </sentence><sentence id="1950">It was through a little <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1951">I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not the one to decide in the first place where he would stay. </sentence><sentence id="1952">And all he did is tried to sell me a bill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And with that, I may, I may survive. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1955">As soon as we walked out, Christa Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think it was Christa Kartigas. </sentence><sentence id="1956">We walked out maybe twenty steps from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1957">I saw an open <span class="dlf">gate</span>, that little pri-- that little <span class="dlf">gateway</span> to a private <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1958">You, you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I ran in, and I ran through the <span class="interior space">garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And a Lithuanian was working in the <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and he followed me and he caught me. </sentence><sentence id="1961">And I loosened myself, and he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be "beschlagnahmt" and the sleeves of the shirt, in his hands. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And I was already away from him. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And I kept running and running and running, until I came to a big <span class="dlf">fence</span> that was -- the, the Lithuanian government had had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="1964">A, a--to, to, to cure animals. </sentence><sentence id="1965">Oh, my God. </sentence><sentence id="1966">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1967">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1968"> 6

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2343">Q: Oh, like an <span class="building">animal treatment center</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: Ok, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And it was a huge tall <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in my height. </sentence><sentence id="2348">It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself. </sentence><sentence id="2349">I climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2350">And halfway on my -- halfway to the <span class="building">building</span>, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2351">So I ran back, climbed over -- from the inside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top plank. </sentence><sentence id="2352">It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. </sentence><sentence id="2353">I walked all day long. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And a tremendous rain storm broke out. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And I hid in the <span class="env feature">corn</span> to hide myself from the rain. </sentence><sentence id="2356">How much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2357">But I, I was, I was like a animal, really. </sentence><sentence id="2358">My mind was like a animal. </sentence><sentence id="2359">And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and, and when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And I, I slept the night over in a, in a, in a, in a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And the next morning, I continued. </sentence><sentence id="2362">By then I was hungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which <span class="building">house</span> I should attempt to go in and ask for something. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And I noticed a big looking <span class="building">house</span>, a big <span class="building">building</span>, and I thought maybe, maybe, maybe a owner of <span class="dlf">property</span> -- they call it pomeshchik,"* in that time -- and most of them were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2364">They, they're land owners. </sentence><sentence id="2365">The rich land owners were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me some food. </sentence><sentence id="2367">So I started to go to that <span class="building">house</span>, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man, because it's a bigger <span class="building">house</span> than the average. </sentence><sentence id="2368">When I came close enough, I noticed it's the <span class="building">Ninth Fortification</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And I went back, and I started again walking. </sentence><sentence id="2370">About noontime, I fall asleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. </sentence><sentence id="2371">And while I fall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, "Zydu*! </sentence><sentence id="2372"><span class="building">Zydu</span>! </sentence><sentence id="2373">Ectu (ph) Gestapo!" -- " </sentence><sentence id="2374">Run to <span class="building">Gestapo</span>!" </sentence><sentence id="2375">So I got up, and I went away. </sentence><sentence id="2376">I, I, L, I just didn't had enough strength to continue from hunger and thirst. </sentence><sentence id="2377">So I walked in, in a <span class="dlf">yard</span> of another <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2378">I took the next best <span class="building">house</span> which to walk in, and I walked in. </sentence><sentence id="2379">It just so happened that the <span class="building">house</span> was up front, and the <span class="building">barn</span> was all the way in the back. </sentence><sentence id="2380">So it took me a distant to go to the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And halfway to the <span class="building">barn</span>, the whole <span class="building">barn</span> was full with German soldiers retreating from the army down the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2382">And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And he saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and embraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him. </sentence><sentence id="2384">Pushed me out from the <span class="region">area</span>, walked in the <span class="building">house</span>, gave me a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2385">And I continued walking. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I walked for quite a distance. </sentence><sentence id="2387">Then I came to a <span class="dlf">highway</span> where a lot of Lithuanians were escaping from the war. </sentence><sentence id="2388">The war was coming nearer, closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="2389">And I lined up and I and I lined myself up with the horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave me something to eat and let me walk with him. </sentence><sentence id="2390">But he told me if the Germans should come and look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that I am a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2391">So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the upper hill of  7 the, of the <span class="dlf">forest-like highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2392">It was no <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2393">It was little <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And towards late at night, again it started to rain, and I was terribly wet. </sentence><sentence id="2395">I walked in, in a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2396">It was a man and two women -- brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2397">They gave me milk and bread. </sentence><sentence id="2398">I, I ate fancy foods all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="2399">Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk. </sentence><sentence id="2400">They took me to the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2401">They dug out a, a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> full of hay which they had prepared from the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2402">They put me in the, in the hay, and they covered it back up. </sentence><sentence id="2403">I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued to walking. </sentence><sentence id="2404">I walked all day, practical all day. </sentence><sentence id="2405">Again hungry, without any food. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And suddenly I'm facing three <span class="dlf">roads</span>: one, two, three. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And what do I do? </sentence><sentence id="2408">Where do you go? </sentence><sentence id="2409">So I pick a <span class="env feature">grass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2410">You know when you were a child, a <span class="env feature">grass</span> -- "You love me, you don't love me." </sentence><sentence id="2411">And I pulled the <span class="env feature">grass</span>, and I designated this one is this <span class="env feature">grass</span>, this one is this one. </sentence><sentence id="2412">And it fall on the one I went. </sentence><sentence id="2413">I went originally to the straight one. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And I continued. </sentence><sentence id="2415">Late in the evening, I came to a <span class="building">house</span> and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in the <span class="env

of a <span class="dlf">field</span> with Jewish men and Jewish women and children. </sentence><sentence id="2423">Was a group of maybe 20, 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And they had dug out a, a, a <span class="dlf">hole</span> and covered with, with, with <span class="env feature">grass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And anytime there was a danger, everybody walked down in
