up. </sentence><sentence id="650">By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the <span class="dlf">routes</span> were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="651">So the family, the family from <span class="populated place">Grodno</span> to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="652">And it took us several days. </sentence><sentence id="653">And we arrived in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="654">Shortly before we came to the proper <span class="populated place">city</span> in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the traffic. </sentence><sentence

kept us for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="657">And since the whole family was in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, resident family, they let them all go -- including me. </sentence><sentence id="658">So I stayed for a few days with that family. </sentence><sentence id="659">Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. </sentence><sentence id="660">And then I -- they told me -- I spoke no Polish. </sentence><sentence id="661">So the family with whom I was staying discovered that there are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German

place">Druskininkai</span>, the <span class="region">resort area</span> where I was, was a <span class="region">resort area</span> only for, for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="663">There were dozens of <span class="building">hotels</span> only for vacationers. </sentence><sentence id="664">And there were many other <span class="building">resort hotels</span> in that <span

</sentence><sentence id="666">And they all lined up in <span class="populated place">Grodno</span>, in the front of the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span> to get passes to go <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="667">And I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="668">The procedure was: there was a big <span class="dlf">street</span>, no traffic, it was blocked off; across the <span class="dlf">street</span> of the <span class="building">building</span> of the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>, the thousands of people were staying and waiting in <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="669">There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the people. </sentence><sentence id="670">And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the <span class="building">Kommandantur</span>, that means they took care of their business. </sentence><sentence id="671">The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to go in. </sentence><sentence id="672">Since thousands of people were waiting on the other side and the guard doesn't designate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. </sentence><sentence id="673">So the guards "(c) "Are You a Jew?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1054">A: The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1056">She was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. </sentence><sentence id="1057">I didn't want my mother to be by herself. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one daughter to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And the first stop she made was in <span class="populated

good will come out from the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And she grabbed Dinah's (ph) hand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and closer to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1064">They were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the <span class="populated place">ravinas</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1065">Ravina, that's a English word? </sentence><sentence id="1066">Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1067">A woman who couldn't read and write, never went to a <span class="building">school</span>, never know what a map means, managed to go from <span class="populated place">Janova</span> to <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1068">And that's how they arrived in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1069">They were hiding during the day, because they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And if there weren't any partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and called over a murderer. </sentence><sentence id="1071">So they arrived in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1072">So I had already a built-in family of my sister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in <span class="populated place">Slobodka</span>, with her little girl, Raisele

</sentence><sentence id="1078">After a while, the rule came out to go into <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother- in-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days before my arrival. </sentence><sentence id="1080">Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. </sentence><sentence id="1081">It was on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I decided to walk to the <span class="building">criminal police headquarters</span> to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal police, Mr. Pomatitis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1083">My relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called *I <span class="building">Ninth Fort  8</span> manager of the new <span class="building">Christian office

on the invoice "office products" to be sent to his <span class="building">home</span>, it was a personal relationship between him and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Since I wasn't some several times for business, and when I became the employee of the <span class="building">government store</span> <span class="building">retail outlet</span>, after the, the Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the <span class="building">store</span> to buy school supplies for the children. </sentence><sentence id="1085">So she told me that he was imprisoned in the <span class="building">Kovno prison</span>, and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1086">So I gave her money to buy the <span class="building">school</span> supplies. </sentence><sentence id="1087">I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf? -- </sentence><sentence id="1088">help -- to her <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1089">My logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from <span class="building">prison</span> from the Communists, and became again the chief of the <span class="building">police headquarters</span> in <span class="populated place">Kovno</span>, my logic was that she would have told him what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1090">He knew who I am. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see him, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in that <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1092">And that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1093">In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through <span class="populated place">Kovno</span> for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I had a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original Lithuanian Army. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button on his--. </sentence><sentence id="1095">With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to

of the <span class="building">police headquarters</span>, within two seconds the assistant of the police, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him. </sentence><sentence id="1100">He went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the opportunity to come and speak to me. </sentence><sentence id="1101">But he'll do

</sentence><sentence id="1374">The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that every Jew who meets a German executive --

going on a, a <span class="building">business</span> like a regular <span class="building">business</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from

</sentence><sentence id="1440">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. </sentence><sentence id="1441">You know what saccharine is? </sentence><sentence id="1442">Sweeteners. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Or sugar or fat or butter. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="1445">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian

ghetto</span> was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> after a day's work. </sentence><sentence id="1448">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the <span class="building">black marketeers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1449">I had a contract in the <span

man. </sentence><sentence id="1451">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to bring in in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And at the <span class="dlf">entrance</span> , by then a lot of people who were brought in some food were already starving. </sentence><sentence id="1453">So by then it was already seven,

id="1455">And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the <span class="building">black marketeers</span> to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. </sentence><sentence id="1457">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. </sentence><sentence id="1458">He didn't bother you. </sentence><sentence id="1459">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you.

<span class="spatial object">units</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1840">When he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the people, the old people. </sentence><sentence id="1841">Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling, kneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child. </sentence><sentence id="1842">So they killed the mother with the child. </sentence><sentence id="1843">They were taking children. </sentence><sentence id="1844">The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the three big <span

was dead before she was thrown in the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1856">When I came back after, when they started to liquidate the <span class="populated

</sentence><sentence id="1863">Immediately, they murdered them. </sentence><sentence id="1864">I was brought in in <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, back in <span class="populated place">KZ Kovno</span>, back to be prepared for the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1865">But then they sent in a new group of guards, and that new group of guards needed service. </sentence><sentence id="1866">They needed to prepare straw, <span class="spatial object">straw mattresses</span> for them. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And I was called in with the other former

old rotten wood. </sentence><sentence id="1871">They were building new <span class="building">barracks</span> up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out and, and -- because the wood was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through. </sentence><sentence id="1872">So I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days before the liquidation of our <span class="populated place">camp</span>, attempted to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1873">We attempted to dig out in the <span

<span class="env feature">earth</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1876">And there was a religious Jew by the name of Portnoy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1877">He had already his family outside, and he had prepared his place for himself outside. </sentence><sentence id="1878">And when he noticed that, he came to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and informed on us. </sentence><sentence id="1879">So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and Wagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who would see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1880">It was not smooth. </sentence><sentence id="1881">There was a guard, <span

class="building">Volksdeutsche</span> is? </sentence><sentence id="1885">And the Nazis recognized Volksdeutsche as Deutsche(tm)(r). </sentence><sentence id="1886">Some of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people -- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Probably amongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Schmittus tried, made so many efforts to help me. </sentence><sentence id="1889">Schmittus was constantly arguing with <span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> against the treatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1890">But he was arguing with the wrong person, because <span class="populated place">Blaufuchs</span> didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. </sentence><sentence id="1891">The day before we were liqui-- before we were taken back to <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, and few days before the total liquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. </sentence><sentence id="1892">His <span class="spatial

when he was driving in, was driving in to, to the other <span class="dlf">wall</span>, turn around, faced his <span class="spatial object">car</span> to get out, and walked to the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1895">So Wagner told me to clean his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span> suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="1896">It was the hour in the day when nobody would expect Goecke to come to the <span class="interior space">dining room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1897">He had his own <span class="building">headquarters</span> in, in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, and he had his own <span class="building">headquarters</span> in the <span class="building">Gestapo headquarters</span>. </sentence><sentence

when nobody would ever suspect or dream that he would come. </sentence><sentence id="1900">The guard who was constantly stationed on the, on the front of the main <span class="dlf">street</span> with the <span class="dlf">sidewalk entrance</span> was a, a, a, a -- also a <span class="building">Volksdeutsche</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1901">A little confused human being, you know, but a very

</sentence><sentence id="1910">That day he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1911">Somebody else -- a stranger who was not under our influence. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And Wagner told me to clean his <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And I removed my beautiful blue jacket with the stars of David on the front and the back in order not to make

</sentence><sentence id="1923">I was wearing <span class="spatial object">galoshes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1924">In July, I was wearing <span class="spatial object">galoshes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1925">But I made movement like I'm clicking my feet, and I shouted loud and clear, "Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke! </sentence><sentence id="1926">Das ist nicht mein Schuld --

</sentence><sentence id="1936">It, it took minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, "Verschwinden!" </sentence><sentence id="1937">And I immediately "verschwind." </sentence><sentence id="1938">You

way, people told me when <span class="building">IJ</span> arrived in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> that that was the day when Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total of six, seven people per group. </sentence><sentence id="1955">About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. </sentence><sentence id="1956">And that's when they permitted me to be saved from <span class="populated place">Goecke</span>, in a situation like that. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Couldn't happen in a million years anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch us and to put us in a <span class="interior space">cage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1959">Shortly before I left the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span>, two or three weeks before, to to and never came to come back to work for the <span class="populated place">Ghettowache</span>, I noticed that Jewish were <span class="building">building</span> near the <span class="dlf">Kaisergasse</span> (ph), a <span class="dlf">gate</span> --a, a, a <span class="dlf">fence</span>, a fenced a, a, a

class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1960">And somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1961">Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the new guards. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And -- no, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1963">I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be happened, and my niece to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="1964">But she got permission to go in a <span class="interior space">bunker</span> which one of the most prominent Jewish people build. </sentence><sentence id="1965">She was a friend of the man's wife, and they permitted her to stay until. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And we figured it's only for three or four days, and in three or four days Russians were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1967">And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in. </sentence><sentence id="1968">And while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name -- came out from the <span class="interior space">bunker</span> and invited me, too. </sentence><sentence id="1969">I am a, I am a breathing difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I was then, and I am today. </sentence><sentence id="1971">So after being there for a couple of seconds, the <span class="building">bunker</span> was built for maybe 12, 14 people. </sentence><sentence id="1972">By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already -- I was already the 67th or the 68th. </sentence><sentence id="1973">It was burning hot in July. </sentence><sentence id="1974">It was the first week in July, so how long could I have stayed in that place? </sentence><sentence id="1975">After a few seconds, I started to cough and I got out. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1977">Somehow, she listened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1978">And we were captured right away on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, and put in the enclosed <span class="dlf">wire fence</span> that was fenced. </sentence><sentence id="1979">We were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of them. </sentence><sentence id="1980">People were stepping on each other already. </sentence><sentence id="1981">We were laying there for three days and three nights. </sentence><sentence id="1982">On the second day, the transportation of the <span class="populated place">Kovno ghetto</span> took place in three groups. </sentence><sentence id="1983">The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. </sentence><sentence id="1984">They went out, and they were taken to <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The second group was my <span class="spatial object">transportation</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1986">But the Jewish that they find on the <span class="dlf">street</span>, they lined them up and safely under the <span class="dlf">fence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1987">But they were going with Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from <span class="building">building</span>, <span class="building">house</span> to <span class="building">house</span>, fish out the people in the hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And there, the woman were laying nude just in a <span class="interior space">garden</span>, and the men were practically nude, and brought them all to the to the <span

concentrated. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And it became a tremendous situation. </sentence><sentence id="1991">You had to do your bowel movements right there and then on the premises because you couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1992">And the stink from the smell from the <span class="interior space">bowels</span> was not to be believed. </sentence><sentence id="1993">I think we were laying there for three, four days or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, to go to the, to the <span class="spatial

for two things may happen while I'm escaping. </sentence><sentence id="2015">Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee; or while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Without

out, about four o'clock in the, early in the morning, I tried to be the last <span class="dlf">line</span>, and I was about in the last <span class="dlf">line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2030">I was about the closest to the right side to be able to run in a, in a, in a private <span class="building">house</span> garden. </sentence><sentence id="2031">It was through a little <span

</sentence><sentence id="2033">And all he did is tried to sell me a bill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. </sentence><sentence id="2034">And with that, I may, I may survive. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2036">As soon as we walked out, Christa Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think it was Christa

</sentence><sentence id="2040">I ran in, and I ran through the <span class="interior space">garden</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2041">And a Lithuanian was working in the <span class="interior

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2436">Q: Oh, like an <span class="building">animal treatment center</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2438">A: Ok, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And it was a huge tall <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in my height. </sentence><sentence id="2441">It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself. </sentence><sentence id="2442">I climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2443">And halfway on my -- halfway to the <span class="building">building</span>, I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2444">So I ran back, climbed over -- from the inside, it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top plank. </sentence><sentence id="2445">It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. </sentence><sentence id="2446">I walked all day long. </sentence><sentence id="2447">And a tremendous rain storm broke out. </sentence><sentence id="2448">And I hid in the <span class="env feature">corn</span> to hide myself from the rain. </sentence><sentence id="2449">How much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2450">But I, I was, I was like a animal, really. </sentence><sentence id="2451">My mind was like a animal. </sentence><sentence id="2452">And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and, and when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. </sentence><sentence id="2453">And I, I slept the night over in a, in a, in a, in a <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2454">And the next morning, I continued. </sentence><sentence id="2455">By then I was hungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which <span class="building">house</span> I should attempt to go in and ask for something. </sentence><sentence id="2456">And I noticed a big looking <span class="building">house</span>, a big <span class="building">building</span>, and I thought maybe, maybe, maybe a owner of <span class="dlf">property</span> -- they call it pomeshchik,"* in that time -- and most of them were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2457">They, they're land owners. </sentence><sentence id="2458">The rich land owners were Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2459">And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me some food. </sentence><sentence id="2460">So I started to go to that <span class="building">house</span>, because I thought it's the owner of a rich man, because it's a bigger <span class="building">house</span> than the average. </sentence><sentence id="2461">When I came close enough, I noticed it's the <span class="building">Ninth Fortification</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And I went back, and I started again walking. </sentence><sentence id="2463">About noontime, I fall asleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. </sentence><sentence id="2464">And while I fall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, "Zydu*! </sentence><sentence id="2465"><span class="building">Zydu</span>! </sentence><sentence id="2466">Ectu (ph) Gestapo!" -- " </sentence><sentence id="2467">Run to <span class="building">Gestapo</span>!" </sentence><sentence id="2468">So I got up, and I went away. </sentence><sentence id="2469">I, I, L, I just didn't had enough strength to continue from hunger and thirst. </sentence><sentence id="2470">So I walked in, in a <span class="dlf">yard</span> of another <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2471">I took the next best <span class="building">house</span> which to walk in, and I walked in. </sentence><sentence id="2472">It just so happened that the <span class="building">house</span> was up front, and the <span class="building">barn</span> was all the way in the back. </sentence><sentence id="2473">So it took me a distant to go to the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2474">And halfway to the <span class="building">barn</span>, the whole <span class="building">barn</span> was full with German soldiers retreating from the army down the <span class="dlf">hill</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2475">And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian. </sentence><sentence id="2476">And he saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and embraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him. </sentence><sentence id="2477">Pushed me out from the <span class="region">area</span>, walked in the <span class="building">house</span>, gave me a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2478">And I continued walking. </sentence><sentence id="2479">I walked for quite a distance. </sentence><sentence id="2480">Then I came to a <span class="dlf">highway</span> where a lot of Lithuanians were escaping from the war. </sentence><sentence id="2481">The war was coming nearer, closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And I lined up and I and I lined myself up with the horse and <span class="spatial object">buggy</span> of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave me something to eat and let me walk with him. </sentence><sentence id="2483">But he told me if the Germans should come and look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that I am a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2484">So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the upper <span class="dlf">hill</span> of " Landowner (Russian) (r) Jew (Lithuanian)  7 the, of the <span class="dlf">forest-like highway</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2485">It was no <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2486">It was little <span class="env feature">trees</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2487">And towards late at night, again it started to rain, and I was terribly wet. </sentence><sentence id="2488">I walked in, in a <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2489">It was a man and two women -- brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2490">They gave me milk and bread. </sentence><sentence id="2491">I, I ate fancy foods all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="2492">Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk. </sentence><sentence id="2493">They took me to the <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2494">They dug out a, a <span class="spatial object">wagon</span> full of hay which they had prepared from the <span class="dlf">field</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2495">They put me in the, in the hay, and they covered it back up. </sentence><sentence id="2496">I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued to walking. </sentence><sentence id="2497">I walked all day, practical all day. </sentence><sentence id="2498">Again hungry, without any food. </sentence><sentence id="2499">And suddenly I'm facing three <span class="dlf">roads</span>: one, two, three. </sentence><sentence id="2500">And what do I do? </sentence><sentence id="2501">Where do you go? </sentence><sentence id="2502">So I pick a <span class="env feature">grass</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2503">You know when you were a child, a <span class="env feature">grass</span> -- "You love me, you don't love me." </sentence><sentence id="2504">And I pulled the <span class="env feature">grass</span>, and I designated this one is this <span class="env feature">grass</span>, this one is this one. </sentence><sentence id="2505">And it fall on the one I went. </sentence><sentence id="2506">I went originally to the straight one. </sentence><sentence id="2507">And I continued. </sentence><sentence id="2508">Late in the evening, I came to a <span class="building">house</span> and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and I should. </sentence><sentence id="2509">After she gave me to eat, she, she sent me upstairs in the <span
