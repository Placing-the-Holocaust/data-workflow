<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: My father came before the war, so his experience was growing up in <span class="country">America</span> from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed out from <span class="country">Germany</span> before the war. </sentence><sentence id="15">And they all had international experiences, some went to <span class="region">South America</span>, some went to <span class="country">Palestine</span>, some -- I mean, every brother and sister was sent to a different relative around the world. </sentence><sentence id="16">His parents both died before I got to know them, his mother outlived his father, and was alive when I was born, but also died when I was quite young. </sentence><sentence id="17">My mother's side of the family only came through me -- to me verbally, because there were no -- no pictorial histories or scrapbooks, or mementos handed down. </sentence><sentence id="18">So it was only her stories and my imagination that gave them any kind of reality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: How would she talk about them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="26"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="27"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin , March 15, 2001 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: She talked about holidays that she remembered when she was growing up, what her family life was like. </sentence><sentence id="29">The talents of the various people. </sentence><sentence id="30">The intellectual capabilities, the accomplishments. </sentence><sentence id="31">Her family was very accomplished in many different <span class="dlf">fields</span>. </sentence><sentence id="32">Sh -- and I think that's why she had great hopes that I would be a pianist like one of her cousins who was world renowned. </sentence><sentence id="33">That didn't do t -- I didn't do too well there. </sentence><sentence id="34">Maybe a dancer. </sentence><sentence id="35">The Russian -- the Russian ballet instructor told my mother, save your money. </sentence><sentence id="36">So th -- so -- so there were -- there were quite a few talents that I did not pick up from her fa -- <span class="region">family side</span>, but reading and education were certainly something that she impressed upon me and I developed my own curiosity in pursuing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of your mother's experience during the war, when you realized she was a Holocaust survivor, although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: No, the dawning was gradual, but the visual indicator was always there. </sentence><sentence id="49">My mother was always physically very different than other mothers. </sentence><sentence id="50">Her physical disabilities worsened as I grew up, and it was because her condition was becoming much more visible and apparent to the <span class="region">outside world</span> that then I came to understand This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin deg March 15, 2001 that she had been born perfectly normal, but because of the beatings that she received in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: How did -- how did you learn about that, though? </sentence><sentence id="60">Did you ask her questions, or did she under certain condi -- circumstances talk about that? </sentence><sentence id="61">Ho-How did you learn about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: There was never a special day that I remember, that was set aside to say this is what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="66">It was, I think, always part of my consciousness. </sentence><sentence id="67">I think -- I remember one thing, one day I remembered seeing one of my friend's parents who had a number on their arm, and I asked my mother why she didn't have a number on her arm. </sentence><sentence id="68">So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friend's parents had been in <span class="populated place">camps</span>, and my mother had been in <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but there was a difference. </sentence><sentence id="69">And I think that started the storytelling a bit more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: I was an only child. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her family, and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child, that her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child. </sentence><sentence id="135">So no matter what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing me, but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a family, and that was me, but there was only just me. </sentence><sentence id="136">So I didn't have any brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="137">I didn't have any grandparents or cousins, or people from her side that she could relate to. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="138">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="139">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="140"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin deg March 15, 2001 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: When you look back, what kind of a child do you think you were? </sentence><sentence id="143">How do you see yourself as a -- as a -- as a younger child? </sentence><sentence id="144">I don't want to lead you, just how did you see yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: My mother will probably say that I was spoiled, and I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="146">My -- I was -- I was -- I will admit that my parents were extraordinarily generous of their time and the amount of input that they put into my cultural awareness. </sentence><sentence id="147">I grew up in the <span class="building">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span>, I tell everybody that I did. </sentence><sentence id="148">I -- I spent more time going to <span class="dlf">botanical gardens</span> and <span class="building">zoos</span> and <span class="building">Radio City Music Hall</span>, and shows when I was young. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I turned around and did the same thing for my daughter because my -- my life -- my childhood was so full of extraordinary outings, that I couldn't wait to turn around and do that when I had a child, so I -- my -- my social activities with my parents were extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="150">Maybe that was to make up for lack of family affairs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: I take it from your -- from what you just said, that you did not experience that necessarily as -- as a pressure, but more as an opportunity, or was it also sometimes a -- a -- a pressure behind this to -- to -- having to fulfill certain expectations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
