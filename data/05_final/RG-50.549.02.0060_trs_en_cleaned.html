<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know. </sentence><sentence id="266">That -- that would have been because they said they were going to close the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> in <span class="populated place">Lodz</span> in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="267">So we just took off before the closing of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are closed in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, we wouldn't be able to get out. </sentence><sentence id="268">So that's what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
