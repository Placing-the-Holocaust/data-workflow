<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: 1939? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: 1939, right. </sentence><sentence id="126">Everything was interrupted the hostilities were in that particular <span class="region">area</span> because not very far the Russians crossed the <span class="dlf">Polish border</span> on the 17th of September and of course, we never expected something like that. </sentence><sentence id="127">We were not prepared for that. </sentence><sentence id="128">We understood that we had one enemy. </sentence><sentence id="129">That was <span class="country">Germany</span>, and that they were going to invade us and probably destroy as much as possible, but all of a sudden, at that time, we didn't know what actually was in that agreement, and that was the story, to participate to divide <span class="country">Poland</span> into two spheres of interest. </sentence><sentence id="130">Then everything stopped, so the <span class="spatial object">Polish units</span>, some of them were able to go <span class="region">south</span> to <span class="country">Hungary</span> or <span class="country">Romania</span>. </sentence><sentence id="131">You know, they were taken there as not exactly prisoners or war, but they were isolated and kept. </sentence><sentence id="132">Eventually they let them go <span class="building">home</span>, but in my case I decided to return <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="133">Unfortunately, of course, there was a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was taken prisoner by Germans and I stayed. </sentence><sentence id="135">I was in a <span class="populated place">prison camp</span> for a couple of hours and I decided not to stay there any longer so I took advantage of a guard that was not paying attention to what was going on, so I escaped. </sentence><sentence id="136">I returned <span class="building">home</span> to to my parent's place at the beginning of October. </sentence><sentence id="137">That was my end of the  They used to work on <span class="dlf">farms</span> or in <span class="building">factories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">As far as Jews are concerned, they were very restricted. </sentence><sentence id="139">They couldn't change their place of <span class="building">residence</span>. </sentence><sentence id="140">They couldn't move, they couldn't communicate, letters or stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="141">They would have to be controlled by the German officials. </sentence><sentence id="142">Every little thing you have to apply to the <span class="populated place">County</span> which was, of course, in charge by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="143">The Germans were in charge. </sentence><sentence id="144">You had to get permission for everything, for food, for everything. </sentence><sentence id="145">For clothing, there was a shortage of clothing, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="146">There was a shortage of food. </sentence><sentence id="147">And, of course, from time to time they demanded from Jewish people to surrender some valuable things in an official or unofficial way, like bribes, you know, trying to get a permit for something, so it cost in the form of gold or something valuable. </sentence><sentence id="148">Those restrictions, they couldn't move from one place to another. </sentence><sentence id="149">In that situation, many young people, Jewish people, people say 20 and up, they knew what was going to happen, so they decided to run away from that situation. </sentence><sentence id="150">The Polish partisans started organizing so they joined them in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, or they simply moved to another place with false identification documents. </sentence><sentence id="151">The one case I remember, the next <span class="dlf">door</span> people his name Shpinrot(ph) had a daughter about 18 years old, Mauka Spinrot, she actually was a friend of one of my brothers, so we talked her into accepting a forged 1.d. </sentence><sentence id="152">card, like a passport. </sentence><sentence id="153">I mean, it had more value than just an ordinary i.d. </sentence><sentence id="154">card. </sentence><sentence id="155">It was like a passport, showing all the details, names the date of birth, religion, her age, and something like that. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, we issued the card for Makur (ph) I believe, a Polish name, and of course, Roman Catholic and everything. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, she took that. </sentence><sentence id="158">They were very grateful for this and she volunteered for the <span class="populated place">forced labor camp</span> in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, this way the Germans treated as one of Poles and no questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="160">I'm not sure because I wasn't there, but I'm sure that she survived. </sentence><sentence id="161">This was the first case I remember. </sentence><sentence id="162">After that, we started doing this more often. </sentence><sentence id="163">Of course, my people, I belonged to the <span class="building">underground organization</span>. </sentence><sentence id="164">That was the organization before , and of course they  were very well trained soldiers, intelligent guys, so I think we were doing very well there with Polish partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: You had a lot of Jewish friends, your family did, but did the other Roman Catholics in the <span class="populated place">town</span> try to help the Jews too? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: How did that affect the <span class="populated place">town</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: It was a terrible thing, because we had a taste of things to come. </sentence><sentence id="242">They used to say, "Oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="243">Today they are taking care of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="244">Tomorrow they will come to pick up and start the same thing with us." </sentence><sentence id="245">Everyone was convinced that this was going to happen like. </sentence><sentence id="246">Young people, as a rule left the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">They were no longer with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="248">I left the <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="249">I was not in my parent's <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="250">I used to sleep two <span class="dlf">blocks</span> away in a different place. </sentence><sentence id="251">Every young fellow at that time, just after this, there was no <span class="interior space">room</span>, no place for young people. </sentence><sentence id="252">Many of them moved to another <span class="populated place">city</span>. </sentence><sentence id="253">Some of them they joined the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="254">What good was that? </sentence><sentence id="255">I was there because I was told to stay there because of the organization. </sentence><sentence id="256">I was responsible for a number of things, and of course, I was hiding but acting. </sentence><sentence id="257">Gradually things were quieting down, gradually, so I got a job. </sentence><sentence id="258">There was some of the <span class="building">stores</span>, old, formerly owned by Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were opened, but that was the government's property, but they still need people to service. </sentence><sentence id="260">In addition, there was a system of distribution of food that especially applied to farmers, the compulsory reporting of agricultural production, what each farmer produced, corn or potatoes or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="261">So, he had to report this, and he had a certain portion, actually the majority of what he produced had to give to the Germans because they need food for them. </sentence><sentence id="262">As a bonus for this, they used to give coupons to buy some hardware on a <span class="dlf">farm</span>, stuff like that, ordinary nails, anything, some food stuff, or clothing. </sentence><sentence id="263">So, they distribute for the produce delivered to the Germans, grain or potatoes or anything, they used to get those coupons so they could get the clothing or anything. </sentence><sentence id="264">It was something like extra -- of course the prices, they paid very little for it. </sentence><sentence id="265">The official price was something unbelievable, low. </sentence><sentence id="266">On the <span class="building">Black Market</span> the price of meat or bread was much higher than what you could get officially. </sentence><sentence id="267">The official price was low. </sentence><sentence id="268">So, to compensate for this, they issued those coupons to make them more willing to deliver that food stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: While you worked in the <span class="building">shoe store</span> you were still part of the <span class="interior space">underground</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: Well, the organization was the smallest unit, was I don't know how it was equivalent to a <span class="spatial object">post</span> which would be corresponding to a small <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Several <span class="spatial object">posts</span> would be a <span class="populated place">county</span>, more or less corresponding to a <span class="populated place">county</span> and several <span class="region">counties</span> again, would be like a <span class="populated place">district</span> and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1124">On our level, it was the smallest <span class="spatial object">unit</span> in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Of course, we had a division of activities was first of all the military activities which included training and preparation for a specific assignments. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Collecting of weapons, ammunition, maintenance, and that will be the military part, as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Then would be a part like a diversion of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Sabotage would have to perform certain tasks, disruption of communication in general or in particular cases according to the situation, according to the needs. </sentence><sentence id="1129">It would be run, usually by soldiers, former soldiers who used to be on active duty in Polish Army, because they used to be most of the time Junior Officers. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Then there would be the political side of it which would be the distribution of <span class="spatial object">press</span> or preparation of future needs of future administration, organizing of future councils which would be planning supply in case of uprising, would be in charge of preparation of food, supplies of food or medications, <span class="building">hospitals</span>, but there was a <span class="interior space">unit</span> also that took care of unfriendly acts of some people who were cooperating with the German authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1131">It could be done in various ways, the most common in situation would be to report some experiences some SS acts, some facts to Gestapo as an act of well loyalty I would say to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1132">For some stupid reason he would discover that he was loyal to the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1133">He started to cooperate with them and he would be reporting all kinds of trespassers like , with the collection of food by farmers, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1134">He would be sabotaging deliveries, so this is -- he would be reporting to Germans all kinds of irregular activities in that <span class="region">area</span>, engaged in which actually were in the interest of Polish population, so these people were not too friendly to Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So, I remember two or three cases that one case was a policeman of Polish nationality who was too eager to please German police, and he hurt so much Polish people, that he was reported to higher authorities, the underground Polish authorities, and the accusations were collected and facts were collected and he was executed in due course. </sentence><sentence id="1136">A similar situation was with another Pole that also was cooperating with German authorities, but not on a more or less on an economical level, like smuggling, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Smuggling was an important part, because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough. </sentence><sentence id="1138">In certain circumstances you have to smuggle, or in many cases they were doing this for gain, but it was a necessary fact, necessary activity for the benefit of Polish population in general. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So if somebody was trying to disrupt this or report some activities of smugglers to German police, the act was unfriendly and if it continued for a number of occasions, so the guy deserved a penalty and in that particular case that I remember, that guy was executed. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Of course, a due course of law was applied to that situation. </sentence><sentence id="1141">There were certain underground jurist, lawyers, judges, of course not  3 employed by the current German administration, but they were original members of Polish jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So, they were knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1143">They knew the law and they were able to issue a proper decision based on their experience and knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1144">One case I know also, a third case, a Jew who was very friendly with the German police also reporting all kinds of activities to German police and he was I understand the story, he was warned several times not to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1145">He was even warned by some Jewish -- as a matter of fact, his family were telling him to stop that nonsense, but of course he was hoping that this way he will be able to survive, and his family, and so he was also killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
