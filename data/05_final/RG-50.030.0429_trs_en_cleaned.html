<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: It is May 6, 1996. </sentence><sentence id="2">This is an interview with Gisela Feldman, a survivor of the SS St. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3"><span class="populated place">Louis</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4">Now first what I would like to ask you is if you would state your name, your date of birth, and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Yes, well. </sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Gisela Feldman and my maiden name was Klapl, K-L-A-P-L, and I was born on the 18th of September, 1923, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> at that time and about your schooling and your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="12">My parents originally came from <span class="country">Poland</span>, the <span class="region">Austrian-Hungarian empire</span> of <span class="country">Poland</span>, at the age of 15, so by the time I was born, they had been in <span class="country">Germany</span> for about twenty years. </sentence><sentence id="13">During the first 10 years, what I can remember is people still had housing shortages and that was a result of the first world war, and it was very difficult to get a decent <span class="interior space">flat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="14">But that affected everybody, it wasn't something that we felt we were singled out for that. </sentence><sentence id="15">But when it got to some of 1932, I was nine then, I became aware of the fact, there was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists. </sentence><sentence id="16">I remember marches in the <span class="dlf">street</span> where people beat each other up. </sentence><sentence id="17">And in the <span class="interior space">block of flats</span> where I lived, a person was even shot because they were demonstrating against the Nazi Party. </sentence><sentence id="18">So that in a nine year old, aroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What was it like at <span class="building">school</span>? </sentence><sentence id="28">Did you feel very well acclimated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes I did. </sentence><sentence id="32">In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish children in the <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="33">And during the sort of beginnings of the Nazi party I had a very good teacher and he kept telling all the children that I was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very well and all that. </sentence><sentence id="34">But that didn't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="35">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="36"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection go on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a <span class="building">secondary school</span>, I had to go to a <span class="building">Jewish school</span> because it was very difficult to stay on in a <span class="building">state school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: You had many friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Yes, I had a, I used to play with the children in the <span class="dlf">street</span> and I didn't feel too discriminated against playing with the other children in the <span class="dlf">street</span>, but I was always blonde and blue-eyed and so I suppose that made a difference too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Was your family particularly religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child, I wouldn't ride on a sharbot(ph) and I wouldn't switch the light on. </sentence><sentence id="51">However my father kept his <span class="building">shop</span> open after going to a service in the morning, he came back because we lived in such a <span class="populated place">Christian neighborhood</span> that, you know, we had to keep the <span class="building">shop</span> open on a Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="52">And our customers really didn't stay away from us until an SS man stood guard outside the <span class="building">shop</span> and told people not to buy from Jews. </sentence><sentence id="53">And even then, some of them were very brave they came in and we had one particular customer across the <span class="dlf">road</span> from us, a Catholic baker, and they also weren't very fond of the Nazis, and you know bakers have to get up very early to bake their bread, and they found somebody dobbing(ph) their <span class="dlf">shop windows</span>, friends of the Jews, and so they just poured buckets of water from the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> over them. </sentence><sentence id="54">So that was really a very brave act in the climate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Do you have a sense of how your parents felt at this time and what did your father do? </sentence><sentence id="61">What kind of <span class="building">shop</span> was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: We had a <span class="building">grocery store</span>. </sentence><sentence id="65">Well, once or twice my father was beaten up in the dark when he came <span class="building">home</span> from the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">And then things got a little difficult. </sentence><sentence id="67">But you see, when you're sort of 12, 13, you don't quite realize the dangers that were going on. </sentence><sentence id="68">But we did know of people whose fathers disappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people's <span class="building">houses</span>, so when the party came to pick This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="69">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="70"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection them up they wouldn't be at <span class="building">home</span>, they couldn't be found. </sentence><sentence id="71">So yes, things were getting very sort of disturbing. </sentence><sentence id="72">But you know, people always say to me, "Why did people not leave early on?," </sentence><sentence id="73">and the only theory I can have is, if you are very poor you can go because you've got nothing to lose, and if you were rich, you know at the beginning you were allowed to take your money out with you, but if you are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security. </sentence><sentence id="74">So that's the only explanation I have because we didn't leave until 39 which was the last moment almost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: So they didn't talk to you much about what they were thinking or about possibly immigrating sooner? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: No, my parents really I think protected us quite a lot. </sentence><sentence id="90">They didn't show their fears a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="91">And our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="92">I don't know whether you know that. </sentence><sentence id="93">My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Poles said that anybody who hadn't returned to <span class="country">Poland</span> for a number of years was going to lose their passports, and I think the Nazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left with all these people with Polish nationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I think that's when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do something, although we had to shut our <span class="building">shop</span> before that so when my father was deported he didn't have any income anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Tell me, just going back just a little bit, when they closed the <span class="building">shop</span>, when was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: That was sort of the beginning of 38. </sentence><sentence id="104">And they also made me leave <span class="building">school</span> because it was then decided education wasn't going to be much use to you if you had to go into a <span class="country">country</span> where you didn't speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="105">So people got their children to learn a trade. </sentence><sentence id="106">I went to <span class="building">dress-making school</span>, people became plumbers, and and so on because you felt if you had a trade in your hands you didn't need to know the language. </sentence><sentence id="107">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="108">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="109"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: And what was your mother. </sentence><sentence id="118">Was your mother a full-time housekeeper? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: No, she worked with my father in the <span class="building">shop</span>. </sentence><sentence id="122">And we had a maid. </sentence><sentence id="123">Which of course I don't remember which year 34, 35, you weren't allowed to have anyone anymore unless they were over 50. </sentence><sentence id="124">Because you know there was this word rusenshen(ph), I don't know if you've come across it. </sentence><sentence id="125">But that's why you're not allowed to have anybody under 50. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: Tell me a little bit about when your father was deported and how that came about and how you first found out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Well, that was obviously something, a very well kept secret because in October, the 28th of October I think, during the night there is a ring at the <span class="dlf">door</span> and two men came in civilian clothes actually, and they said to my father , "Pack your bag, get your passport" . </sentence><sentence id="134">And you know that was a very frightening experience and my sister panicked, she's three years younger than I, and she started shouting at them and they said , "Well if you don't keep quiet we will take you away as well." </sentence><sentence id="135">I must have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandwiches for my father for him to take the sandwiches. </sentence><sentence id="136">But we didn't know why or what or where they were going to go, they didn't tell us, and while they were watching my father I rushed out down the <span class="dlf">street</span> to go to a <span class="spatial object">phone</span> and phone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> so we knew they had also got them. </sentence><sentence id="137">And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the <span class="building">railway stations</span>, and then all the women rushed to the <span class="building">railway station</span> to see if they could still see their husbands or fathers, but we didn't see our father, but eventually we heard from him that he was in <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="138">And they had apparently there was some sort of tug-of-war between the Germans and the Poles because the Poles didn't want to take them, the Germans wouldn't let them back, and there was a <span class="populated place">camp</span> where they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in <span class="country">Poland</span> so he and his two brothers went to the family. </sentence><sentence id="139">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="140">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="141"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: So after he arrived in <span class="country">Poland</span> you were able to correspond with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: We were going to speak to with him on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>, we were able to speak to him on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span>. </sentence><sentence id="154">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="155">Well it wasn't war time yet, you see, it was 38, it was just before Crystal Night actually that they were deported. </sentence><sentence id="156">The 28th of October, Crystal Night was in November so it wasn't very far apart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: So tell me a little bit about Crystal Night and that evening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Well, I really got up, we got up the next morning, and you see not living in a <span class="region">Jewish area</span> we weren't so aware as to what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="164">Our <span class="building">shop</span> had gone so really there wasn't much <span class="dlf">Jewish property</span> for them to destroy. </sentence><sentence id="165">But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt's <span class="building">house</span> and yes, you were walking through glass. </sentence><sentence id="166">You know once you neared <span class="building">Jewish shops</span> and the <span class="building">synagogue</span> and so on then you could see what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="167">That's why it's called Crystal Night, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="168">We were walking on glass. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: In between the time that your father was deported and the time that you were attempting to leave did things get progressively worse? </sentence><sentence id="176">What was it like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: First of all we were asked to leave our <span class="interior space">flat</span>, for a German couple, and strangely enough my mother went to <span class="building">court</span> and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know, that he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we moved in with my aunt after that whose husband had also been deported. </sentence><sentence id="180">And then my mother started seriously to look around for some place for us to go. </sentence><sentence id="181">Because we had no income. </sentence><sentence id="182">There was no safety anymore. </sentence><sentence id="183">We children couldn't go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="184">So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave, because you see even the lot of the German people I think didn't believe that our friends anyway that he could stay in power. </sentence><sentence id="185">And a lot of the Jewish people who had become so much part of the <span class="country">country</span> and the professional people who held jobs in <span class="building">hospitals</span> and everywhere, nobody could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="186">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="187"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection believe that an intelligent <span class="country">nation</span> could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn't imposed on them, because Hindenburg supported him and he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that such a tyranny could go on but they are, that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="188">And so then my mother started looking around and by that time it was very difficult to get a visa to go to any <span class="country">country</span>, and so people took any visa they could get. </sentence><sentence id="189">I know friends of ours went to <span class="country">China</span> and eventually these Cuban visas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currency, which really meant you had to smuggle money out of <span class="country">Germany</span> in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my mother did, she smuggled money out, and she didn't even know who it was going to, it was some sort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a child. </sentence><sentence id="190">And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to be perfectly legal. </sentence><sentence id="191">And then my mother had to arrange a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> to take us across and she got four <span class="dlf">passages</span> on the <span class="spatial object">boat</span> called the <span class="spatial object">St. Louis</span> which was meant to sail from <span class="populated place">Hamburg</span> on May the 13th, which it did. </sentence><sentence id="192">And the Germans allowed people to come back into <span class="country">Germany</span> providing they were leaving again. </sentence><sentence id="193">It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them. </sentence><sentence id="194">My father applied to come back and the Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="195">And so my father phoned up in tears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined woman because she said "I have to take the children out." </sentence><sentence id="196">In any case, there was another <span class="spatial object">boat</span> leaving after ours, the <span class="spatial object">Orinoco</span> and she couldn't get four <span class="dlf">passages</span> on the next <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, but one she could get, so she was determined to take up three of the <span class="dlf">passages</span> and my father was going to join us afterwards on the next <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: You had how many siblings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: [had a sister, I have a sister still, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: So at the time you had your mother, you and your sister, the three of you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="222">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="223">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="224"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Three of us were going yes. </sentence><sentence id="226">And actually the finalization of the visas didn't happen until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="227">We were to leave on a Saturday and Friday morning we still hadn't heard that everything was finalized, so my mother rushed off to sort things out, then she called me on the <span class="spatial object">phone</span> and I went with her, and then on the Friday afternoon we got everything finalized, and we phoned my 12 year-old sister and she did all the packing and we left on the Friday night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Do you know much more about how she obtained... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: The visa? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: No, I'm afraid I don't. </sentence><sentence id="238">I just know that she had to pay with it for it with foreign currency and I think they were bought abroad, paid for abroad in the <span class="building">Cuban embassy</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: So your father never made it out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Never made it out, no? </sentence><sentence id="244">You know, if you know the story of the St. Louis, when we got to <span class="populated place">Havana</span>, they wouldn't allow us to land, and the next <span class="spatial object">boat</span> was leaving two weeks later, and when the captain heard that we couldn't land I think they got as far as <span class="populated place">Antwerp</span>, they turned back but they didn't tell the passengers they were turning back, and they ended up back in <span class="country">Germany</span> and then my father had to go back to <span class="country">Poland</span> and we never saw him again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: So he did manage the next <span class="spatial object">boat</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: He managed the next <span class="spatial object">boat</span> but he went back to <span class="country">Germany</span> and then eventually to <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: So tell me a little bit about the <span class="dlf">passage</span>, initially you were on the <span class="spatial object">SS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="252"><span class="populated place">St. Louis</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes, well we left on May the 13th, and if you manage to get a hold of the documentary, you will see how efficient the Germans are because they found all the old footage of us getting on, and they even found me as a 15 year old amongst all that crowd getting onto the <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="256">But we left on May the 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a <span class="spatial object">luxury liner</span>, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="257">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="258"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the captain was a wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="259">He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="260">We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really saw anything into that because we all felt the <span class="spatial object">ship</span> was going to come back empty and it was only fair that they were paid for this. </sentence><sentence id="261">And it was an experience to be on a <span class="spatial object">liner</span> where you had a <span class="building">cinema</span> and a <span class="interior space">ballroom</span> and a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span>, and all the usual games you have on a <span class="spatial object">boat</span>. </sentence><sentence id="262">Obviously very few of us had ever been on a <span class="spatial object">cruise</span> so it was exciting for us youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="263">But my mother never took part in anything. </sentence><sentence id="264">She didn't worry us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="265">And it must have been an awful thing to leave your place where you've lived, and leave a husband behind who didn't want you to go. </sentence><sentence id="266">My mother had ten marks, which I don't know how much it would have been then, perhaps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we were allowed to take out. </sentence><sentence id="267">So she must have been terribly worried about the future, you know two children, twenty dollars, no job, nothing to go back to. </sentence><sentence id="268">And so, but she never worried us at all. </sentence><sentence id="269">And during the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began to go wrong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: What was the feeling within the passengers with you as a teenager could get a sense of anywhere along the <span class="dlf">line</span> between the...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads. </sentence><sentence id="289">And it appears then, we sort of found out they were people let out of <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, they had to sign papers to say they would never return to <span class="country">Germany</span>, they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take part in the festivities that were going on, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="290">We had our Friday night services, we had a portrait of Hitler in the <span class="interior space">ballroom</span>, but the captain allowed us take it off during the services and then it had to be put back after the service. </sentence><sentence id="291">It's very difficult for me now to say what I remember as a teenager and what I've read since, of course, it's very difficult to separate these things. </sentence><sentence id="292">Because there was also a book written about it, called "The Voyage of the Damned," but unfortunately I feel This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="293">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="294"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection it's a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too. </sentence><sentence id="295">And so I don't know if I know it from the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us. </sentence><sentence id="296">The only thing I know is my mother had a <span class="interior space">cabin</span> on her own and one night she woke up and found somebody searching through things and walking around the <span class="building">cabin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="297">And after that she never slept alone again. </sentence><sentence id="298">So I don't know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Did you know before you hit <span class="populated place">Havana</span> at all that the visas, the transit passes was canceled? </sentence></p></dialogue>
