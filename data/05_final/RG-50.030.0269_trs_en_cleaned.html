<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: And where were you educated prior to <span class="building">law school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Well when we came as immigrants to the <span class="country">United States</span> I was raised in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="54">I went through the typical type of <span class="populated place">New York</span> immigrant lower <span class="region">East Side</span> beginning, and then my father got a job as a janitor -- they didn't call them "supers" in those days -- in an <span class="building">apartment house</span> in <span class="interior space">Hell's Kitchen</span>, over on <span class="dlf">56th Street</span> and <span class="dlf">Tenth Avenue</span>. </sentence><sentence id="55">And there's where my earliest recollections begin. </sentence><sentence id="56">From there I went to the <span class="building">New York school system</span>, the <span class="building">public schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="57">My parents were divorced when I was six, so I went out to live with an aunt who lived in <span class="populated place">Brooklyn</span> and that's where I actually started <span class="building">school</span>, because I was too small and I couldn't speak English, so they wouldn't take me at the <span class="building">school</span> until I was seven. </sentence><sentence id="58">So I was off to a slow start, I was a slow starter. </sentence><sentence id="59">But my education was primarily in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="60">I caught up with my education by going to <span class="building">Townsend Harris High School</span>, which was a <span class="building">school</span> for-- with accelerated curriculum. </sentence><sentence id="61">From there I went into <span class="building">City College</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span> and from there to <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: What did you major in at <span class="building">City College</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: At <span class="building">City College</span> I majored in sociology. </sentence><sentence id="74">And interestingly enough, I was always interested in crime prevention. </sentence><sentence id="75">Maybe that related to my early recollection in a highly dense <span class="region">crime area</span>, <span class="interior space">Hell's Kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="76">If you look at a map of crimes in the <span class="country">U.S.</span>, that was black because there were more crimes committed there than in any place else and that may have stimulated my interest in crime prevention, because there but for the Grace of might have gone I.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Were you an only child? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="101">When the parents were divorced they had to find their own way and fortunately both remarried and they both lived happily ever after and we all lived happily ever after. </sentence><sentence id="102">My mother and father were related, they were cousins, second cousins who were assigned to marriage at birth and it didn't work out but their subsequent marriages worked out very well and then we all became good friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: What made you go to <span class="building">law school</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: I always wanted to be a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="109">I don't know where it came from, and I don't know why, because I didn't know any lawyers but somehow I always wanted to be a lawyer and that's why I went to <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Was there any particular interest in the law? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Yes, I was interested in crime prevention and I had no interest whatsoever in taxation. </sentence><sentence id="115">I thought "I'm never going to have any money, and I'm not going to defend anybody on a tax matter, I have no interest in corporate law." </sentence><sentence id="116">And so I was immediately involved in criminal law, and did very well. </sentence><sentence id="117">I won a scholarship on that at my first exam at <span class="building">Harvard</span>, and then I The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="118">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="119">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="121">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="122">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="123"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection went to work under one of these student aid programs for a professor of criminal law and criminal administration, Professor Sheldon Glueck at <span class="building">Harvard</span>, who was the leading authority in the field of juvenile crime. </sentence><sentence id="124">And that had an important influence on my later career. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: When you were in <span class="building">college</span>, the War had started? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: No, the War started when I was in <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="141">I recall the December 7th when <span class="populated place">Pearl Harbor</span> I'm talking about the <span class="country">United States</span> involvement in the War. </sentence><sentence id="142">The War was on in Europe, but the <span class="country">United States</span> involvement began when I was at <span class="building">Harvard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="143">And I remember the day when everybody went down to--to enlist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Were you conscious of National Socialism, what it was doing in <span class="country">Germany</span> prior to going to <span class="building">Harvard</span> while you in <span class="building">college</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Oh yes I was, very much so, but there was then a large movement to stay out of the War during the early years, an anti-War protest movement. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I think I was more inclined to be sympathetic to that movement than to anything else. </sentence><sentence id="152">There was a general awareness of the persecution of the Jews, for example, and I remember a protest rally which took place in <span class="building">Madison Square Garden</span> -- I think my parents went down there -- to protest and call for a boycott against <span class="country">Germany</span> for the persecution of the Jews, so we were aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="153">But it was only when I got into <span class="building">Harvard</span> that this Professor Gluck began to receive reports of the atrocities in <span class="country">Poland</span>, because he had been invited by what was then called the United Nations War Crimes Commission, had nothing to do with the United Nations as we know it today, to be the American member of that. </sentence><sentence id="154">And he funnelled all of those reports to me so I was very The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="155">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="156">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="157">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="158">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="159">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="160"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection much aware of what had been happening to the Jews [in] <span class="country">Poland</span>, beginning in 1939, because we got those reports in 1940-41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: And these are very detailed reports? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: They were quite detailed in terms of the size of the massacres. </sentence><sentence id="177">We didn't have, you know, such details as pulling out gold teeth and making <span class="spatial object">mattresses</span> out of the hair but we knew that the Jews were being rounded up and sent to <span class="populated place">camps</span> where they were being exterminated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Were you an <span class="building">Einsatzgruppen</span> reports? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="183">I never heard the word "<span class="building">Einsatzgruppen</span>" until many years later, so we didn't have the characterization of the nature or the specific units involved in the massacres. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: When did you enlist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: There's another story there. </sentence><sentence id="189">I assumed that I would go into the <span class="building">Army</span> immediately when the War broke out, and I tried to get into different <span class="building">branches</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">I first applied for military intelligence, I knew French, and I thought I would be helpful and I knew other languages I knew some Hungarian and Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="191">But my parents hadn't been citizens for 15 years, and so I was disqualified. </sentence><sentence id="192">And then I tried to get into the <span class="building">Air Force</span>. </sentence><sentence id="193">First, I was too short to be a pilot, and then I tried to be a navigator and then they changed the rules they were altered a bit and then I reapplied and then I failed on my eyes -- missed two letters on the <span class="dlf">20/20 line</span>. </sentence><sentence id="194">And then I tried to take training exercises. </sentence><sentence id="195">And while all this was going on I was still in <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">There's a very strange story; that my wife tells--there's somebody watching over me. </sentence><sentence id="197">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="198">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="199">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="200">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="201">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="202">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="203"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection To make a long story short, I tried to get in every branch of service without success, until I got out of <span class="building">law school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">I then went back to my <span class="spatial object">draft board</span> and I was very concerned that something had happened. </sentence><sentence id="205">And the clerk of the <span class="building">draft board</span> came up to see me and I told him I hadn't been called up. " </sentence><sentence id="206">What's going on here?" </sentence><sentence id="207">And he had received a letter from the Dean, I think it was Dean Landis, in the middle of my first year, saying that it would take another month or two before I finished the first year and they should give me deferment until the end of the year so I wouldn't have a complete disruption. </sentence><sentence id="208">They had granted that and I thought then I could then go in. </sentence><sentence id="209">But they ah this member of the draft board came up to me afterwards and said, "How did you do in <span class="building">law school</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="210">and I was very puzzled by that question, and he told me he had been a student at the <span class="building">Yale Law School</span> in the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="211">And he had been wounded and had never been able to go back to <span class="building">law school</span> and his life had been ruined; and he just wanted to protect me from that kind of an experience. </sentence><sentence id="212">So it was a strange fluke -- I never saw the man before and never saw him again, but he reached his hand out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Why did you want to go. . </sentence><sentence id="241">.why did you want to enlist so badly when prior to this you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, I thought -- I could have stayed out of the War. </sentence><sentence id="245">In fact, one of the first doctors who examined me, you know, I just about made the height requirement and I was having trouble with my stomach -- I always had a nervous stomach -- and he said, "Well, you won't qualify" and I said, "Why not?" </sentence><sentence id="246">and he said, "Because we can't meet your dietary needs" and so on. </sentence><sentence id="247">But I always felt that I didn't want to ask anybody else to go and die for me. </sentence><sentence id="248">So I was trying to get in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Where were you first assigned? </sentence><sentence id="255">Where did you first go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="258"> The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="259">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="260">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="261">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="262"> The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="263">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="264"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, the <span class="building">Army</span> of course immediately recognized my talent. </sentence><sentence id="266">I was fresh out of the <span class="building">Harvard Law School</span> so they made me a buck private in the artillery and I was in the <span class="interior space">supply room</span> as a typist; I couldn't type, of course. </sentence><sentence id="267">And as a matter of fact, they really did recognize my talent: Within 30 days they made me a Private First Class. </sentence><sentence id="268">So I figured out at that rate in 18 months I'd be a General. </sentence><sentence id="269">Well, of course three years later I was still a corporal. </sentence><sentence id="270">Leave it to the <span class="building">Amny</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">I didn't like the <span class="building">Army</span> at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: I hated the regimentation always. </sentence><sentence id="282">I felt the Army, all armies, it was nothing particularly directed against the American, or the German Army for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="283">I think my hatred of the American Army may have equalled that of mine for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="284">I didn't know the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="285">But it's the dehumanizing process that takes place in an <span class="building">Army</span> where as part of the training the first thing you do is take human beings and make <span class="spatial object">robots</span> out of them. </sentence><sentence id="286">And I refused to become a <span class="spatial object">robot</span> and that caused me endless grief in the Army because I was always being reprimanded and sent on KP and I refused to march. </sentence><sentence id="287">And I said that was the dumbest thing I ever heard of. </sentence><sentence id="288">I explained to my first sargeant that the reason people march is that it went back to Roman times when the soldiers had to carry their shields on the right side or the left side or over their head and march in formation because they were being attacked by spears from the <span class="env feature">hills</span>. </sentence><sentence id="289">And if they didn't move in formation the <span class="spatial object">spears</span> could penetrate, and kill them, and therefore it was very important that they moved as a unit, and I said that was very important. </sentence><sentence id="290">I said, "If we are going to attack any Romans with spears on a <span class="dlf">hill</span> then that's the way we should march. </sentence><sentence id="291">But if we are facing a guy with a machine gun, and you march in formation, he'll kill you all. </sentence><sentence id="292">So what you have to do is not march in formation, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="293">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="294">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="295">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="296">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="297">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="298"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you have to run, to dig a <span class="dlf">hole</span> and run in opposite directions." " </sentence><sentence id="299">OK, wiseguy, in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>." </sentence><sentence id="300">So off I went to the <span class="dlf">slop pits</span> and I cleaned more <span class="building">latrines</span> and more <span class="dlf">slop pits</span> than anybody else in the Army, which is very good training for later life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: It didn't change you one bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: No, it made my resentment greater. </sentence><sentence id="325">I think I hate all armies, and I am absolutely anti- militaristic, and I think the notion of training a human being to push a button which will result in killing a million people, or a hundred thousand people, and thinking nothing about it, is a horrendous thing to do, and incidentally that's exactly what the Germans did to the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> inmates. </sentence><sentence id="326">The first thing they did was dehumanize them -- shave off their hair; give them a number on their arm; lose their identity as people, and that's how you break the human spirit, and it works. </sentence><sentence id="327">But it didn't work with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: How long did you stay in this...where were you assigned first? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, first we went to basic training in <span class="region">Carolina</span>, which is great, you know, because you march around, march all day, march up and down again, and you do all those absolutely ridiculous things that you do. </sentence><sentence id="335">And I kept on saying "There's a war going on, don't you, is there nothing more important that I can do than just march up and down here, you know, clean out the <span class="interior space">slop pits</span>?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1269">A: Well, there are so many memories it's hard to know where to begin, but one thing that comes to mind which struck me particularly at the time was the May First, the May Day celebration in one of the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, I think it was Ebensee(r), where the inmates were celebrating their liberation and the May Day. </sentence><sentence id="1270">It was organized by the Communists who were in charge of most of the <span class="populated place">camps</span> immediately after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1271">They were the best organized. </sentence><sentence id="1272">There was a big <span class="interior space">tribune</span> with Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill and there were going to be big speeches, but first there was going to be a parade of the inmates and they were broken down in national groups. </sentence><sentence id="1273">The Russians marched with a red banner, and the French and the Italians and the Yugoslavs and the Romanians and the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And then there was a group marching along, a bedraggled group, and they had no flag. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And I asked one of the inmates, "Who are they?" </sentence><sentence id="1276">And they said, "Oh, those are the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1277">I said, "Why don't they march with you?" </sentence><sentence id="1278">And he said, "No, no, the Jews, they're separate, that's not us, those are the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1279">So there was the antisemitism still in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> after liberation as a reflection, you know, of the ethnic hostility which we see today in many parts of the world still, And another event which strikes me as perhaps noteworthy is that as the <span class="populated place">camps</span> were about to be liberated, the Germans tried to move the inmates out, those who were still able to walk or to work. </sentence><sentence id="1280">They left those behind to be killed or to die who were too sick. </sentence><sentence id="1281">But they marched them out, and they were marching I think it was from <span class="populated place">Flossenbiirg</span> to march to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> or one of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1282">They took them through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and they marched at night, 8 A subcamp of <span class="populated place">Mauthausen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1283">The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="1284">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="1285">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1286">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="1287">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="1289"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 and if anybody faltered on the way they were immediately shot; if anybody paused to try to pick up a potato or to eat a root or something they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="1290">I was able to follow this <span class="dlf">trail</span> through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> of <span class="dlf">mass graves</span> -- 10, 20, 30, 50 killed, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1291">And I would get the nearest farmer to say, "Dig them up." </sentence><sentence id="1292">They would say, "Oh yes, we heard firing there last night, there was shooting going on," "Where was it?"

Nazis money could buy, and they were very good. </sentence><sentence id="2101">I decided that I was going to prosecute the case, without calling a single witness. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And the reason I did that was because the documentary evidence spoke for itself; it was absolutely reliable. </sentence><sentence id="2103">It was their reports from the front. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2626">A: The <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> judges had no rules of procedure when they began. </sentence><sentence id="2627">The charter of the <span class="building">international military tribunal</span> defined the crimes, and the jurisdiction of the <span class="building">court</span>, but left it to the <span class="building">court</span> themselves to lay down their rules. </sentence><sentence id="2628">But since the judges were all distinguished jurists, the British presiding judge, for example, they knew the rules of evidence, they knew what was a fair trial. </sentence><sentence id="2629">And they had to merge different judicial systems; the French system, for example, is quite different from the American and the British. </sentence><sentence id="2630">The Russian is also quite different. </sentence><sentence id="2631">So, it was necessary for them to come up with rules of fairness, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="2632">They did very well. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> we had the benefit of their rulings to guide us, and in addition we developed our own tules as we went along, all of which were then si -- published in a big volume, volume 15 of the green series, by the United States government. </sentence><sentence id="2634">So that this information is available for use in The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="2635">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="2636">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2637">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="2638">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="2639">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="2640"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 <span class="country">Yugoslavia</span>, or the <span class="building">courts</span> in the future, if there are any such <span class="building">courts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And the fact that the rules didn't exist in advance, didn't mean that the decisions were unfair to the defendants. </sentence><sentence id="2642">I felt they were unfair to the prosecution. </sentence><sentence id="2643">But after all, the defendant is a guy on trial, so I didn't really mind it too much, although I was most annoyed. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Would never have gotten away in a -- in an American or a <span class="building">New York court</span> with the things which were admitted in evidence in the Einsatzgruppen trial. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2687">Q: Ben, I wanted to ask you something about what seems to be a controversy over the nature of the three indictment categories: Crimes Against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes Against Humanity. </sentence><sentence id="2688">Can you comment on what became emphasized and what became de-emphasized at these trials, and why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2691">A: It's not so much a matter of emphasizing one against the other. </sentence><sentence id="2692">The first category that you mention, Crimes Against Peace, or otherwise known as Aggression, that has been perceived for a long time as being, as the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> said in this case in the IMT" trial, the greatest of all crimes because it encompasses all the other crimes. </sentence><sentence id="2693">When you commmit a Crime Against Peace, an act of aggression, the war that follows invariably involves killing large numbers of people and the rape and the devastation and the destruction and every crime that you can imagine take place in a war. </sentence><sentence id="2694">So, commmitting a war of aggression is the most serious crime that any head of state can commit. </sentence><sentence id="2695">This was known after the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="2696">And efforts were made at that time to bring the Kaiser to trial for aggression against little <span class="country">Belgium</span>, for example. </sentence><sentence id="2697">And this was hotly debated by international lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="2698">The Kaiser himself had fled to the <span class="populated place">town</span> of <span class="populated place">Doorn</span> in <span class="country">Holland</span> where he was known as "the Woodchopper of <span class="populated place">Doorn</span>" -- the Dutch refused to extradite him because there was no precedent for trying a head of state for the crime of aggression. </sentence><sentence id="2699">And the international lawyers who were dealing with it, including the American and Japanese, who were then on our side, felt that -- well, all right, in order not to have retroactive justice, they will not try him for the crime of aggression, because it had never been declared to be an international crime. </sentence><sentence id="2700">They would charge him, in the Treaty of Versailles, of "crimes against the dictates of human conscience," which had been referred to 4 The <span class="building">International Military Tribunal</span>.

for further information about this collection 9 in the Hague Agreements of 1899. </sentence><sentence id="2708">But that wasn't good enough, because a head of state had never been tried. </sentence><sentence id="2709">So the Dutch still refused to turn him over and he never was put on trial. </sentence><sentence id="2710">However, when we got to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, Justice Jackson, who was a first-class jurist, said, "Look, the time has come for the law to take a step forward." </sentence><sentence id="2711">The principle of non- retroactive activity is a principle of equity, you don't charge a person of a crime when he didn't know it was a crime at the time it was commmitted. </sentence><sentence id="2712">However, did not Hitler know that invading a <span class="region">state</span>... a friendly <span class="region">neighboring state</span> is a crime? </sentence><sentence id="2713">Did not everybody in the world know that? </sentence><sentence id="2714">So to declare that a crime does not violate any equitable principle, particularly in the light of all the precedents that we have. </sentence><sentence id="2715">We had the Hague Agreements in 1898, of 1907, we had the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928 saying that war is outlawed. </sentence><sentence id="2716">These pacts all had loopholes written into them, and then Jackson was certainly aware of that, but he said, "Look, the time has come and there's nothing unfair about trying these guys for the crime against peace, of committing aggressive war, even though "aggression" was not defined." </sentence><sentence id="2717">And Jackson dealt with that in his opening statement -- he said, Look: aggression has not yet been defined in legal terms but whatever it was, this is it, 1 know an elephant when I see one. </sentence><sentence id="2718">So he was deliberately takiing the law a step forward to do...to keep up with the common sense of mankind. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And it was based upon the long tradition which had already been established that the medieval notion of warfare, where the king goes out and kills, doesn't apply in modern times. </sentence><sentence id="2720">So that was the first and the most important principle out of the Nuremberg Charter. </sentence><sentence id="2721">Incidentally, all of these principles were then affirmed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly, and they were also affirmed by the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> which examined the thing, and I will tell you in connection with the Crimes Against Humanity, they interpreted it in a very restricted way. </sentence><sentence id="2722">The second one was the Crimes Against Humanity. </sentence><sentence id="2723">That connotation had never existed before and the theory behind it was: when crimes reach a certain magnitude, they shock the conscience of humankind. </sentence><sentence id="2724">They are crime The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="2725">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence

about this collection 0 not merely against the state, which happens if somebody murders somebody in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, it's the <span class="region">State of New York</span> against so-and-so defendant. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But it's a crime against all of humanity, and therefore humanity as the injured party has the right to be the plaintiff and can bring the charges for that crime. </sentence><sentence id="2732">That also was a step forward, but it was not an unfair step forward, it was a necessary step forward if you were going to have a civilized international society. </sentence><sentence id="2733">And in medieval notions, which were perfectly okay perhaps when a king lived behind a <span class="dlf">castle wall</span>, didn't apply. </sentence><sentence id="2734">So Crimes Against Humanity was another step forward. </sentence><sentence id="2735">The third category, War Crimes, that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had defined what's permissible in warfare, what's not, any violation and devastation beyond the needs of military necessity, rape, plunder, poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well established crimes, they presented no problem. </sentence><sentence id="2736">Now there was a restriction put on by the <span class="building">International Military Tribunal</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2737">The <span class="building">Tribunal</span> itself, in reviewing its own jurisdiction, said, Look: we have the right as international lawyers of great repute -- they were key people from all the <span class="country">countries</span> -- to examine the Charter and see whether the Charter is an exercise in creating new law or whether it is a legal instrument which we are bound by. </sentence><sentence id="2738">They said it's a legal instrument we are bound by because it enunciates principles which would be binding, and which are, binding law. </sentence><sentence id="2739">But, they said, because of the wording of the statute -- and it was an accident, really, for someone put a semicolon in, I won't go into the detail -- in order for there to be a Crime Against Humanity, it must also be linked with one of the other crimes, Crimes Against Peace. </sentence><sentence id="2740">And that meant that the killing of large numbers of people without a war would not be a Crime Against Humanity, would not be within the jurisdiction of the <span class="building">Court</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2741">And that's what they held. </sentence><sentence id="2742">Some of us who'd been involved were shocked at that interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="2743">We said, "That's wrong! </sentence><sentence id="2744">We didn't have that in mind. </sentence><sentence id="2745">You mean to tell me that Hitler kills all his Jews and he's not at war with anybody else, that is not a punishable offense?" </sentence><sentence id="2746">That's what the <span class="building">Tribunal</span> said: under this Charter we cannot act. </sentence><sentence id="2747">So we changed The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

</sentence><sentence id="2753"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 that. </sentence><sentence id="2754">We changed that very specifically by a Control Counsel law -- the governing agency of all of <span class="country">Germany</span> at that time was the <span class="building">Control Counsel</span> consisting of the four Powers -- <span class="country">Soviet Union</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, the <span class="country">U.S.</span>, and the --which did I leave out? -- </sentence><sentence id="2755">the <span class="country">U.K.</span> And this <span class="building">Control Counsel</span> enacted Control Counsel Law No. </sentence><sentence id="2756">10 which corrected that and said very specifically: Crimes Against Humanity are not linked to any other crimes, and that meant that if you killed your own nationals and the crimes were of such magnitude that they shocked the conscience -- that was not more clearly defined -- then it becomes a Crime Against Humanity, which is a different international criminal offense. </sentence><sentence id="2757">And that was then confirmed in the <span class="building">Einsatzgruppen</span> case while I was pushing on that one and in one other case in the subsequent trials. </sentence><sentence id="2758">So that today, despite the confusion which exists among many international lawyers who write big books on the subject, the fact is that it is the legal right of nations to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity, and I think it is a legal duty on their part to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity. </sentence><sentence id="2759">And that has tremendous consequence for the development of peaceful and law-abiding international society. </sentence><sentence id="2760">Quick lecture. </sentence><sentence id="2761">Sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2860">There were about 15 or 16 death sentences pending; over 13 came out of my Einsatzgruppen Trial. </sentence><sentence id="2861">When John McCloy came in as High

Court</span>, they couldn't act until that was settled. </sentence><sentence id="2862">The appeal was rejected by the <span class="building">Supreme Court</span> of the <span class="country">United States</span> and the <span class="dlf">lot</span> fell to McCloy. </sentence><sentence id="2863">McCloy had been the Assistant Secretary of War during World War II. </sentence><sentence id="2864">He was a very distinguished establishment lawyer from <span class="populated place">New York</span>, originally been from <span class="populated place">Philadelphia</span>, and he knew nothing, really,

was Assistant Secretary of War. </sentence><sentence id="2865">So he had his <span class="building">legal department</span> study all of these records. </sentence><sentence id="2866">And he did something else: he appointed a three-member panel, a Clemency Board, to review the cases and make recommendations as to what should be done. </sentence><sentence id="2867">The principal officer was

tried 22 of them, because of the number of <span class="spatial object">seats</span> we had in the <span class="interior space">court room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3342">But what about the rest? </sentence><sentence id="3343">We had records. </sentence><sentence id="3344">We knew who they were. </sentence><sentence id="3345">We knew where they had been, and there was material not only in that case, but all of the other 12 subsequent trials had many residual fall outs. </sentence><sentence id="3346">So, we set up at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> what we called a

published. </sentence><sentence id="3359">So, I was doing this wrapping up thing, and looking forward to going back and resuming a normal life and starting a <span class="building">law practice</span> in <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3360">That was my intention. </sentence><sentence id="3361">One day I had a visit from a man who was the General Counselor to the <span class="building">American Joint Distribution Committee</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3362">This is the Jewish organization which was the most active, and the leading one --the only one-- at the time in assisting the <span class="building">D.P.s</span> in the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, providing assistance to Jews, throughout the world, not in the <span class="country">United States</span>, at that time it was all in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3363">And their <span class="building">headquarters</span> were in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and their director was a man by the name of Doctor Joseph Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And their counsel said, would I come to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3365">They would like to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="3366">And I came to <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, and they said, "Look, we have a problem, and we'd like you to help us with that problem." </sentence><sentence id="3367">And that problem is this: that the Jewish organization had succeeded in persuading the U.S. Government to enact a law providing for the restitution of property which had been stolen, confiscated, or taken by duress by the Jews or from others, because the restitutional laws covered not only Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3368">And one provision of that law was that the heirless property, or the unclaimed property which had been taken from those who were no longer there to file a claim should also be restored. </sentence><sentence id="3369">Now, normally, if a person dies heirless in the state of <span class="populated place">New York</span> or anyplace else, the <span class="dlf">property</span> is escheat, they call it, or passes to the state. </sentence><sentence id="3370">But there's a principal law which says that they may not be the beneficiary of any unlawful act. </sentence><sentence id="3371">If you murder your wife, you cannot inherit her <span class="dlf">property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3372">If you murder the Jews, the state which is responsible can hardly be the proper recipient of the heirless property. </sentence><sentence id="3373">So, military government as a matter of military law, don't forget <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: I was hired for that job in August 1948 and we had an immediate major crisis. </sentence><sentence id="3492">The law required that all claims be submitted by the end of that year, the end of December "48. </sentence><sentence id="3493">That was we had about three months, four months, in which to find staff, find funding, train staff, locate the <span class="dlf">property</span>, submit the claims on long forms, because this was the first step in a long Judicial process. </sentence><sentence id="3494">Well, the first thing I did was to recognize that that was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3495">So, as soon as I agreed to undertake the job, I resigned from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, and I went to see the Commanding General who was General Lucius Clay, who was the Commanding General for all U.S. Forces in <span class="country">Germany</span> and stationed in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3496">I had known General Clay from before because I had been head of the branch in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> that had been collecting the evidence for the trials, and I went up to see him and I said "I've got this problem and I need an extension of the law." </sentence><sentence id="3497">I said, "I can't locate all the confiscated Jewish properties, hundreds of thousands of properties of all kinds all over <span class="country">Germany</span> in three months time with no staff, no money, no nothing, and we discussed the problem and he said, "No, I don't want to extend the law, because the sooner we get this problem over with the better off we're going to be. </sentence><sentence id="3498">This will be a thorn in <span class="country">Germany</span>'s side and I don't want to extend the restitution law." </sentence><sentence id="3499">I said, "All right, I'll tell you what we'll do. </sentence><sentence id="3500">I'll make a deal with you. </sentence><sentence id="3501">I will try to get it done, and I will only come back to you if it's impossible, but I will try. </sentence><sentence id="3502">But in order to get it done, I need money. </sentence><sentence id="3503">First of all, I need staff." " </sentence><sentence id="3504">Well," he said, "Didn't the organization know that when they wanted to get this written into the law that it would cost money to do that?" </sentence><sentence id="3505">I said, "You can't ask the Jewish organization which are now spending every penny they can raise to save the lives of these D.P.s to move them out of here and to rescue them to put money The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. </sentence><sentence id="3506">The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. </sentence><sentence id="3507">It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3508">This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview. </sentence><sentence id="3509">The interview is part of the United States <span class="building">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>'s collection of oral testimonies. </sentence><sentence id="3510">Information about access and usage rights can be found in the catalog record. </sentence><sentence id="3511"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 into trying to get restitution of <span class="dlf">Jewish property</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3512">I said, "I think we can take the money out of occupation funds." </sentence><sentence id="3513">The United States Army was running on occupation funds, which meant the <span class="building">German treasury</span> printed the money, and we used the money to pay for whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="3514">He said, "You know I can't get occupation funds because that requires Quadripartite approval. </sentence><sentence id="3515">The Russians are going to have to agree. </sentence><sentence id="3516">They'll never agree to using their money for private property claims. </sentence><sentence id="3517">I don't think the French will agree and I don't think the British will even agree. </sentence><sentence id="3518">And I can't do it on my own." </sentence><sentence id="3519">So I said, "Well, I have another proposition. </sentence><sentence id="3520">Let me borrow the money from the <span class="region">American segment</span> of the occupation funds, and when I get restitution I'll repay the money." </sentence><sentence id="3521">He said, "Can I do that legally?" </sentence><sentence id="3522">I said, "I have a memorandum here which says you can." </sentence><sentence id="3523">He said, "Well, okay, if you say it's legal and I can do it, go down and talk to my finance man and tell him that's it okay and that whatever money you need to get going, but get going because I want to get this program over with." </sentence><sentence id="3524">So, I went down and I talked to a guy in charge of finance and I said, "I just came from the General and we're setting up a big restitution program here and we got a big rush job and I need enough funds to get this thing going," and he said "How much do you need?" </sentence><sentence id="3525">And I said, " A million marks." " </sentence><sentence id="3526">Okay, sign here." </sentence><sentence id="3527">A million marks was a hell of a lot of money and I signed here. </sentence><sentence id="3528">I was always ready to sign. </sentence><sentence id="3529">I signed promising to repay. </sentence><sentence id="3530">With that money I immediately went out and hired a tremendous staff of German investigators.

</sentence><sentence id="3543">Many of them and the Estonians and were very busy killing Jews before they retreated with the Germans and were captured by the Americans and then used by the Americans.

could file an appeal to the appellate branch of the judicial system in <span class="country">Germany</span>, <span class="building">German courts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3590">And then there

very early on. </sentence><sentence id="3609">Let me just make two or three to show you how history might have been quite different with a few wrong decisions. </sentence><sentence id="3610">The first key issue we had was at what rate of exchange do you have to repay. </sentence><sentence id="3611">The principle of the law is simple. </sentence><sentence id="3612">Ifa person enters into a contract under duress, when that duress is removed, he has the option of undoing the contract, but he has to give back what he got, and he gets back what he gave. </sentence><sentence id="3613">These are the principles of law that I learned at <span class="building">Harvard</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3614">They are principles of equity and they're not something invented by military government. </sentence><sentence id="3615">They should be applicable, and they are applicable in one way or another in all civilized societies. </sentence><sentence id="3616">But what happened was, when the <span class="dlf">property</span> was transferred in 1937 or "38, let's assume the Jewish owner received 100,000 Reichsmark coins, by 1949 or "50 the Reichsmark no longer existed. </sentence><sentence id="3617">It was a <span class="country">Deutschmark</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3618">And the <span class="country">Deutschmark</span> was converted at a ratio of ten to one. </sentence><sentence id="3619">So he received a 100,000RM and he was giving back 10,000DM and the Germans said, Wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="3620">I gave you 100,000 marks. </sentence><sentence id="3621">You're now giving me back 10,000 marks." </sentence><sentence id="3622">If the Jewish owner had been required to give back 100,000 marks he would have said the <span

id="3625">It would be completely different. </sentence><sentence id="3626">I had a lot of problems with this. </sentence><sentence id="3627">I took this case to the <span class="building">Court of

of them, having been forced to survive using all kinds of means were less than the most honorable or credible people. </sentence><sentence id="3659">To put it bluntly, some of them were a bunch of crooks as confirmed by their being arrested from time to time on various charges. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And they said, we are the owners. </sentence><sentence id="3661">For example, in <span

made the argument that those who are entitled are scattered everywhere and we couldn't give the assets to a small self-proclaimed group who were not subject to any kinds of controls, which we were of

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4466">Q: Ben, tell me something about the cultural restitution of <span class="spatial object">cultural objects</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4468">A: Since the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, JRSO, or as the Germans called it, JRSO"", was authorized to claim all unclaimed or heirless Jewish property. </sentence><sentence id="4469">It also recovered thousands, many thousands of <span class="spatial object">Jewish cultural objects</span>, which had been assembled by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4470">For example, the Germans collected Torah scrolls. </sentence><sentence id="4471">A <span class="building">warehouse</span> full of <span class="spatial object">Torah scrolls</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4472">Tons of Jewish ceremonial objects taken from all the <span class="region">occupied territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4473">It was in <span class="building">Einsatzstab Rosenberg Special Unit</span>, Alfred Rosenberg was the Nazi ideologue and it was named in his honor which had that as their assignment to go and seize all <span class="spatial object">Jewish cultural objects</span> and hold them. </sentence><sentence id="4474">The Nazis had various plans for them. </sentence><sentence id="4475">These were eventually assembled in a big <span class="building">warehouse</span> in <span class="populated place">Wiesbaden</span> in the custody of the United States Army, and they in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was the director. </sentence><sentence id="4476">Now, thereto, out first goal was to try to locate the owners if there was a Kiddush plate or something that had the name "This is the family of so-and-so of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>" we tried to find out where the man was. </sentence><sentence id="4477">If it came from the congregation that still existed we tried to send it there. </sentence><sentence id="4478">We did the same incidentally with individual properties of restitution. </sentence><sentence id="4479">If the owner showed up later and said, I didn't file a claim on time or it was too short, but I'm really the owner, I'm really the heir, we worked out what we called an equity procedure of giving the <span class="dlf">property</span> back to the real owners, subject to a very modest 10 percent I think it was service charge for the expense in getting it back. </sentence><sentence id="4480">So, here our first goal was to restore it to the rightful owners. </sentence><sentence id="4481">But usually you couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="4482">So, the next goal was try to distribute them wherever they were needed for Jewish reconstruction, the reconstruction of Jewish life. </sentence><sentence id="4483">7 Pronouned "Ear-so." </sentence><sentence id="4484">The following transcript is the

by the Jewish organizations to do that called Jewish cultural reconstruction. </sentence><sentence id="4491">And Professor Salo Baron of <span class="building">Columbia University</span> was a member of our board of directors was in charge of that and Hannah Arendt was one of the persons who first came to <span class="country">Germany</span> to help guide us with what to do with these things. </sentence><sentence id="4492">Because I really -- I was a young fellow, I didn't really know anything about Jewish cultural life in <span class="country">Germany</span> and particularly the religious life. </sentence><sentence id="4493">So, we set up this Jewish cultural reconstruction, and we had staff. </sentence><sentence id="4494">We were still in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4495">This was the very early days, to come in to help us with that. </sentence><sentence id="4496">Hannah Arendt was one and then we brought in experts from <span class="country">Israel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4497">There was a gentleman by the name Narcus, another Shanomi who came from the <span class="building">Museum</span> in <span class="country">Israel</span> to help us with the Kiddush cups and with the pointers and the Torah crowns and all of the objects. </sentence><sentence id="4498">We also had people restoring them. </sentence><sentence id="4499">We had, for example, a <span class="building">school of scribes</span> working in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, to restore Torah scrolls, and I learned that a scroll can be repaired except if the word "Shaddai," or God, is injured in which case you cannot -- if that's been damaged you cannot restore that. </sentence><sentence id="4500">The Torah scroll has to buried in <span class="country">Israel</span>, following a certain religious ritual. </sentence><sentence id="4501">All of which we followed very precisely. </sentence><sentence id="4502">I was very insistent on that. </sentence><sentence id="4503">I said "Look we take the law as laid down by the <span class="building">Rabbinical Council</span>, and we don't vary that in any way and that is absolutely strictly to be observed." </sentence><sentence id="4504">And it was. </sentence><sentence id="4505">The <span class="building">School of Scribes</span> sat in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> under the control of the JDC and they repaired those Torahs that could be saved, and the Rabbinical Council would advise where they were needed. </sentence><sentence id="4506">New congregations in <span class="country">Israel</span>, big recipients. </sentence><sentence id="4507">Congregations in other <span class="region">parts of the world</span> where they needed some sent as remembrance scrolls to different <span class="populated place">communities</span> throughout the world. </sentence><sentence id="4508">And we did the same with the <span class="spatial object">ceremonial objects</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4509">Where we could find the owner, we restored them. </sentence><sentence id="4510">Where we couldn't, we returned them. </sentence><sentence id="4511">Where it was damaged, we restored them, we then distributed wherever it was needed, and at the end we still had tons of broken silver. </sentence><sentence id="4512">Knives, forks, dishes, plates. </sentence><sentence id="4513">All kinds of little bits and scraps. </sentence><sentence id="4514">And the question was what do we do with

</sentence><sentence id="4521">And I, being very careful, found a Jewish silversmith, <span class="building">Goldsmith Brothers</span> in <span class="populated place">London</span>, and I said, all right we'll send it to them. </sentence><sentence id="4522">They cannot be repaired. </sentence><sentence id="4523">We cannot trace the owners. </sentence><sentence id="4524">They are just scraps. </sentence><sentence id="4525">Nothing can be done with it. </sentence><sentence id="4526">We'll smelt it down and we'll use the proceeds then for Jewish charity. </sentence><sentence id="4527">I thought that was being very clever. </sentence><sentence id="4528">And I went to the board of directors in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, where we had our annual meetings and I reported on the great care that we exercised in disposing of all these things and I was feeling very cocky and very proud of myself and I said and now we have received $50,000 for these silver scraps which we sent off to the silversmith Goldsmith Brothers in <span class="populated place">London</span>, and they smelted them and they sent us the proceeds and this is now available for distribution by the charitable organizations. </sentence><sentence id="4529">Whereupon the first person to raise his hand a member of the board of directors. </sentence><sentence id="4530">A very distinguished elderly gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="4531">He is now and was less elderly then, he is still living, Isaac Lewin who was the Chairman of Augudat Israel world organization, and he said "Mr. Ferencz, do my ears believe me? </sentence><sentence id="4532">You took these holy objects and you sent them to a <span class="building">crematorium</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="4533">Boy, I knew from that question that I was cooked, and I tried to explain the best I could that it was not really a <span class="building">crematorium</span> it was just our way of trying to carry out our

forget in the drama of the <span class="building">courtroom</span>, they think ah, the criminals are punished; it's over. </sentence><sentence id="4952">It's not over. </sentence><sentence id="4953">The victims are more important than the criminals. </sentence><sentence id="4954">Criminals can be punished or killed. </sentence><sentence id="4955">It doesn't make a big difference unless it's a deterrent to the repetition of the crimes. </sentence><sentence id="4956">But what do you do about those who survived? </sentence><sentence id="4957">And this was a problem which was not addressed by military government except in the very crudest way of seeking compensation for time spent in a <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>, but it's much more complicated than

us in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, a former Jewish Berlin lawyer by the name of Herbert Schoenfeld who was a bachelor and a very charming man. </sentence><sentence id="5367">And he said, "What shall I do in <span class="populated place">Bonn</span>?" </sentence><sentence id="5368">I took him out, he was head of the <span class="building">JRSO Stuttgart office</span> and I said "You make friends. </sentence><sentence id="5369">All you have to do is make friends." </sentence><sentence id="5370">And I gave him a big <span class="spatial object">American car</span>, which cost nothing because I got it from the Army and we had free gasoline and free logistic support, and I said, "I want to know what the Germans are thinking before they think it." </sentence><sentence

be six billion marks or nine billion marks and the Germans said oh no it's going to be 12 billion marks and we can't afford that. </sentence><sentence id="5392">By the time this program is over, it will cost the Germans well over a 100 billion marks. </sentence><sentence id="5393">They already passed the 100 billion mark figure. </sentence><sentence id="5394">That, in today's dollar, at seventy cents a mark, a hundred billion marks would be about 70 billion dollars is what it would cost the west German government, now the reunited German government, to meet these claims. </sentence><sentence

don't how many are still alive, but the last time I looked at the count, a few years ago perhaps, there were over a hundred thousand Nazi victim survivors, Jewish Nazi victim survivors, who were

</sentence><sentence id="5405">That was not easy because for years they denied that there could be any mental disability caused if it did not appear immediately on liberation. </sentence><sentence

to prove that their grandfather had not had a nervous breakdown at some point. </sentence><sentence id="5415">And the German doctors were hostile. </sentence><sentence id="5416">I must say they were hostile. </sentence><sentence id="5417">And the German agencies that we had to deal with this were very often hostile. </sentence><sentence id="5418">It depended upon the <span

</sentence><sentence id="5426">And they couldn't understand that every case was different. </sentence><sentence id="5427">They'd say my sister got the same, and my friend, it was the exact, why did they get more than I did? </sentence><sentence id="5428">Well, there was always a reason. </sentence><sentence id="5429">Sometimes it wasn't a good reason, but to have them understand that was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="5430">So, this entire program, which expanded as we went along, it was originally intended to be over by ten years, I knew it would never be over in ten years, the
