Oh, I went out into the <span class="dlf">court yard</span> and...uh...he told me to quickly go into the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>, didn't even have time to take any of my belongings and so forth, and we went on with...to my <span class="building">house</span> and he...uh...put...put hay, and he covered me with hay and potatoes and turnips and all kinds of vegetables he had and he told me that if I...if... he will tell me when to hide with the sacks over because there's going to be some sentries who are going to be...uh...checking the <span class="spatial object">wagon</span>. </sentence><sentence id="88">And...uh...we came to his <span class="building">house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="89">He locked me up in the <span class="interior space">basement</span> of his <span class="building">house</span>, and the next morning we arrived at my <span class="building">house</span> and my mother was in hysterics because she heard all the Jewish children were taken out into the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and shot and she heard somebody who had escaped. </sentence><sentence id="90">So when I arrived I keeped asking, "Why are they doing it." </sentence><sentence id="91">And my mother said, "Just because we are Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="92">And...uh...that same evening, I'll...I'll never forget the scene. </sentence><sentence id="93">My mother...uh... proclamation came out that we have to bring all our valuables to special, to a <span class="building">gymnasium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="94">And my mother just said she's not going to bring...bring some of her valuables that she had because it was really not something you go out and buy. </sentence><sentence id="95">It was handed down from grandmother to granddaughter and sort of, so she decided to bury it outside...uh...in...uh...in the <span class="interior space">courtyard</span> and...where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="96">And...uh...like 2 days after...uh...we...uh...heard ...uh...shouting and screaming and broken glass and they were out at our <span class="dlf">door steps</span> and the neighbors cheering and...uh...throwing all kinds of things and calling us and...uh... we were taken into a distance. </sentence><sentence id="97">And all I can remember as a child you look around what's happening, and all you see is people carrying pillows. </sentence><sentence id="98">And I could just always in my mind, you know, just looking and see people were taking the <span class="spatial object">pillows</span>. </sentence><sentence id="99">And we were taken into <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and...uh...we drove a distance and then we were told to get off the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we saw some <span class="building">houses</span> and everybody started running to...to...uh...find... They told us to get off and get into the <span class="building">houses</span>, and then there was shooting and some people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="100">And...uh...in a situation like that, you see the best of people and you see the worst of people. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we got back into the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and we drove on, and then we came to a place with <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and it became the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> which was known under several. </sentence><sentence id="102">.the <span class="populated place">Kovnick Ghetto</span> but we really knew as <span class="populated place">Slebotka Ghetto</span>, the ghetto of <span class="populated place">Slebotka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">And there we stayed and food became very, very scarce and...uh...uh...there was a...uh...man by the name of Motka. </sentence><sentence id="104">And to this days, I wish I had any kind of connection with those people. </sentence><sentence id="105">I don't know whatever happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="106">Uh...He taught...he picked certain children who were blue-eyed, blond and decided we didn't look Jewish, like people thought Jews should look, and...and he told us if we are to survive we are to smuggle food into the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="107">So people gave me some valuables and he opened up a <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span>...uh...with his pliers he showed how to open up the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and escape through it from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and then tell us where we could go and get food. </sentence><sentence id="108">I can remember carrying butter and bread in my underwear to bring back to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> and to going through the <span class="building">sentry</span> and being afraid that when I remember one time (sign) it was so bad and this was after a while that I, with another boy, I decided we would stay out and we would not go back to the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>, but we missed our family so much. </sentence><sentence id="109">We were taken out every, practically if we could, to...uh...to the <span class="dlf">fields</span> to work the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and farming, and I can remember going to a place and making boots that the Germans took out and...uh...everyone said that we were next of the children. </sentence><sentence id="110">They were taking more and more  children and older people and men and they never came back and we found out that they were taking them at <span class="building">fort 9</span> and <span class="building">fort 7</span> and...uh...we...that became...we never even knew there were other places. </sentence><sentence id="111">We thought that was the only two places, and we were the only ones Lithuanian. </sentence><sentence id="112">I mean we didn't know know if there were other places Jews were being in the same kind of danger although we heard about <span class="country">Poland</span>. </sentence><sentence id="113">And...uh...and life went on. </sentence><sentence id="114">Everyday we saw nothing but bodies and..uh...uh... For me, as a child, the most horrible memories was to see my mother... uh...suffering to see us as children being so deprived of any kind of humanity, of anything. </sentence><sentence id="115">And...uh...when I think of it, what my mother went through was even worse than me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="116">Because as a child, you can fantasize with certain things. </sentence><sentence id="117">I remember...I now one thing. </sentence><sentence id="118">When we lived on the <span class="dlf">farm</span>, one of my favorite flowers and living now in <span class="region">California</span>, I try to grow it and I have a hard time, is <span class="building">Nostortum</span>. </sentence><sentence id="119">And it has a wonderful scent although here it doesn't have the same scent as back then. </sentence><sentence id="120">And I could put myself in a trance to smell that Nostortum in the..in the midst of death or anything, just to...just to experience some life. </sentence><sentence id="121">It was a wonderful feeling even if | felt any kind of pain when I would cut myself and so forth to know that I am alive because as a child, I felt I wasn't alive. </sentence><sentence id="122">I was just walking around in the midst of all the death...of death. </sentence><sentence id="123">And...uh...it's a miracle that one can live so few... few years that the few years...it was a quite a few years and the months and the days and hoping the next day something will be better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: What most stands out in your mind from the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: From the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Is (sigh) (long pause) The things that stands out most of the <span class="populated place">Ghetto</span> is the helplessness of the people. </sentence><sentence id="194">And the good in the people. </sentence><sentence id="195">And some of it the bad in the people. </sentence><sentence id="196">I feel the heroism that there were for caring for one another in the midst of death, and I also can remember the bad of people against each other because of this situation. </sentence><sentence id="197">That's why I say in a situations like this, you get the best and you get the worst. </sentence><sentence id="198">And the most outstanding, the most memorable thing that I have and the most horrifying thing is when we had to go and to be to stand in appell and you see they would have proclamation and they would say this and this <span class="region">section</span> have to go to this and this <span class="dlf">field</span>, and we never knew which <span class="dlf">line</span> would come back. </sentence><sentence id="199">It would be one would say left, one right, and it became apparent that if one family stood together very rarely would they take the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="200">They may just leave one member or two and now as an adult, I could see what was so easy to break the will to live. </sentence><sentence id="201">Because when you are in situation where they take your mother or your brother or your sister, how do you feel? </sentence><sentence id="202">I mean the kind of psychologically what you're going through in your mind and how you feel about, you don't almost care what happens to you. </sentence><sentence id="203">You want to be with that person. </sentence><sentence id="204">And...uh...so it became apparent how to outsmart them is to separate, not to stand together as a family and...uh... and that was something that I will never forget when...uh...we had...we finally were separated. </sentence><sentence id="205">My brother was taken and sent to <span class="populated place">Dachau</span>, and we were taken in...into <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and... uh...we were shipped...we were going...we were standing up like sardines in the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> and not...and they always seemed to be doing it on the worst raining or dreary or  snowy days...uh...hot days...uh...and those are the kinds that ...that stands out. </sentence><sentence id="206">The other thing that stands out in my mind, I remember when we...we stayed in the <span class="building">house</span> where we lived in...uh...there was one <span class="interior space">room</span> and we had to share with about nine families in this <span class="interior space">room</span>, and there was hardly any kind of <span class="interior space">room</span>, and this one person who was...uh...with the...uh... with the Jewish police and...uh...he gave, evidently, my name to be taken instead of his child...uh...and...uh... two other children and I happened not to be in the <span class="building">house</span> when they came to take me, and they took his child instead of me, and he came back and he started throwing things and hitting me and screaming at my mother and that I was supposed to go instead of his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="207">So incidents like that and...uh... never leaves your mind, you know, and...uh...you feel helpless, and you're constantly in a state of helplessness. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="226">Uh...My cousins and my aunts and uncles all lived in <span class="populated place">Josvani</span> and some lived in <span class="populated place">Kiddon</span> and they were all massacred. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...When I was in <span class="country">Israel</span> I found out that about 147 members of my family were taken out to a flield and they were all shot. </sentence><sentence id="228">And how I know is a cousin who was with them who...uh...thought that he was...they thought that he was killed...he was shot...was shot and was able to crawl out from wherever he was on the <span class="dlf">field</span>, and crawl and practically on his belly and he collapsed. </sentence><sentence id="229">Uh...They...in a <span class="building">farm house</span>, and the people took pity on him and he stayed there all through the war in <span class="country">Lithuania</span>, and then went back to <span class="populated place">Kaunas</span> and he got married and my brother brought them to <span class="country">Israel</span> and he just died about 2 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="230">And he told me. </sentence><sentence id="231">That's how I knew that the whole family... The first thing after we survived, we looked for all the family, and there was hardly any, except a distant cousin in <span class="country">Israel</span> and this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: How long did you consider...Were you as a child smuggling food in and out all this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="242">Quite...quite a bit, and...uh...a number of times and...uh...my mother did not know in the very beginning and my brother tells me stories that he was asked to join the Partisans and he had a chance to escape, but he wanted my older sister to go with him and she wouldn't go and leave my mother and me, and so they stayed. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh...It's that kind of heroism and unselfishness that you want to, you know, to hold on to one's family whatever was...was left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Can you describe the appell that you were in when your brother was taken and tell us what happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Well, we were asked to...it was very early. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was...uh...very early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="251">Uh ..We had to assembly out there to... They said to bring just whatever we can carry and we didn't have very much, and we came to this place. </sentence><sentence id="252">It was <span class="dlf">hugh field</span>, and it was in...uh...the time...you know you lose time whether it's the months and the days and so forth, but I know one thing that the <span class="dlf">field</span> was already...the vegetation of the <span class="dlf">field</span> was gone, so it had to be like in the late fall. </sentence><sentence id="253">And we were told to stand there, and what we were doing, we didn't know and we stood and we waited and we waited and...uh...towards...uh...the evening, like around...was already getting dark, towards dark, around dust, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span> came and they went left  right and they took my brother away. </sentence><sentence id="254">They took, in fact, they took ...uh...all the men away, and all the men were taken away, and we stood there and after awhile, we were put into <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="255">And (sigh) it was just no place even to breath and we...we drove through <span class="populated place">towns</span> after <span class="populated place">towns</span> and...uh...they brought us to <span class="populated place">Stutthof</span> and...uh...
