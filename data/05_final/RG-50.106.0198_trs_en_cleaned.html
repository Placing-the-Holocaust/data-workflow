id="182"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 7 August 9, 2012 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="184">And while we're hiding in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he escapes from <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and manages to get across a <span class="dlf">railroad track</span> just as a <span class="spatial object">Nazi munitions train</span> was going. </sentence><sentence id="185">So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they shot him in the hand and shot his finger. </sentence><sentence id="186">And he started running away as the <span class="spatial object">train</span> was coming by. </sentence><sentence id="187">And of course they did not dare fire at that <span class="spatial object">train</span> because there would be a massive explosion. </sentence><sentence id="188">Ok. </sentence><sentence id="189">Then while he was running this was in a <span class="env feature">woods</span>, a very deep <span class="env feature">woods</span> in <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="190">And he met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. </sentence><sentence id="191">And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather's diary. </sentence><sentence id="192">Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was a very big man and no shoes could fit him. </sentence><sentence id="193">So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and had him sleep in the <span class="building">barn</span> and gave him three breads. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">And my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. </sentence><sentence id="195">He said well I'll just leave my <span class="dlf">barn door</span> open. </sentence><sentence id="196">Then if I get asked, I could say I don't know who sleeps in my <span class="building">barn</span>. </sentence><sentence id="197">So my grandfather did that and the next day he left. </sentence><sentence id="198">And when he was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, oh and he was given a shovel. </sentence><sentence id="199">And in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, he was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="200">And suddenly he heard two or three men speaking Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="201">And they had escaped an aktion, very near this <span class="env feature">woods</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">And one of them had a gun. </sentence><sentence id="203">And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess because he looked good on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="204">The Polish cavalry. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">He did. </sentence><sentence id="206">And I think that's why they took him. </sentence><sentence id="207">But anyway, so he was -- they made him the leader. </sentence><sentence id="208">They dug this <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> and that's the one that I called the <span class="building">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="209">Ok, it's a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> in this <span class="env feature">woods</span>, yes. </sentence><sentence id="210">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: How far from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Quite a ways I think. </sentence><sentence id="213">Because this was in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> -- now, I'Il describe the <span class="building">bunker</span> in just a moment. </sentence><sentence id="214">But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two things. </sentence><sentence id="215">One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki's son had been killed by the Nazis. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">Because he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. </sentence><sentence id="217">Now but before then he had told his father that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> very soon. </sentence><sentence id="218">So my grandfather knew that it was just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Ok. </sentence><sentence id="220">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you about the <span class="building">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="221"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="222"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 8 August 9, 2012 The <span class="interior space">bunker</span> to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. </sentence><sentence id="223">And there was a <span class="dlf">ladder</span> to go in and as I remember it, it seemed very tall. </sentence><sentence id="224">Probably it was no more than six feet. </sentence><sentence id="225">And as you walked around, you felt this cold, wet <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="226">And at one side, here was the <span class="dlf">entrance</span>. </sentence><sentence id="227">Then there was this cold wet <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="228">And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a <span class="spatial object">table</span>, like the kind that electric wire comes on, those <span class="spatial object">spool tables</span>. </sentence><sentence id="229">And I just, I remember it feeling splintery. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="230">And I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="231">And then again some more wet <span class="env feature">mud</span>. </sentence><sentence id="232">Then like an <span class="dlf">archway</span> out of <span class="env feature">mud</span> again and a separate <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="233">On the, as you walked into that <span class="interior space">room</span>, on the left were things that I later found out were guns. </sentence><sentence id="234">And rifles. </sentence><sentence id="235">What I, and how [I I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather smacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. </sentence><sentence id="236">And that's when I realized those were dangerous. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="237">I don't remember the people in the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">Eventually there were 37 people in the <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="240">But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men volunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="241">Well I have to tell you that how they lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid <span class="spatial object">Nazi trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="242">They would raise, they would kill the drivers and take -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: They were escaped from the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: They were not in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="245">They were in this <span class="env feature">woods</span>, in the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>. </sentence><sentence id="246">And they would go out on raids where they would raid <span class="spatial object">Nazi munitions</span>, <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>, <span class="building">outposts</span>. </sentence><sentence id="247">Take whatever, food, clothing, everything. </sentence><sentence id="248">Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this <span class="env feature">woods</span> and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep trying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="249">So the Nazis thought that these Jews who were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. </sentence><sentence id="250">But they were not. </sentence><sentence id="251">Now the Banderovski didn't like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews were doctors. </sentence><sentence id="252">Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. </sentence><sentence id="253">We'll stay out of your way kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="254">We'll leave you alone. </sentence><sentence id="255">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="256">Well my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son, the Nazis were going to burn the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> so he got the two volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="257">They all dressed in Nazi  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 9 August 9, 2012 uniforms, had commandeered a <span class="spatial object">Nazi jeep</span> and drove to the outskirts of the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> at night. </sentence><sentence id="258">The two men stayed. </sentence><sentence id="259">My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span>, got my mother, my father, my baby sister and me out. </sentence><sentence id="260">Put us in this <span class="spatial object">jeep</span> and brought us to the <span class="building">home</span> of Mr. Borecki. </sentence><sentence id="261">Because my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother and the two girls" lives and he said of course. </sentence><sentence id="262">And so we came in the middle of the night and we were at Mr. Borecki's <span class="building">house</span> and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. </sentence><sentence id="263">I will not. </sentence><sentence id="264">I've already lost my mother. </sentence><sentence id="265">I'm not going to lose you. </sentence><sentence id="266">So they had no choice but all of us now went to the <span class="building">bunker</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: This is 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Do you know what month or what season? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A:I- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: That's all right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: It probably was still winter. </sentence><sentence id="300">Because there was snow and the <span class="building">bunker</span> was still relatively safe because the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="301">So it was winter, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: End of <span class="populated place">43</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Yes, mm hm. </sentence><sentence id="308">Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. </sentence><sentence id="309">Then apparently and this I hear from my grandfather, my baby sister. </sentence><sentence id="310">Oh there were 37 people in that <span class="dlf">tunnel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="311">My mother and my father and us. </sentence><sentence id="312">My grandfather's son, my uncle, his wife. </sentence><sentence id="313">And I think their two boys. </sentence><sentence id="314">They had two boys. </sentence><sentence id="315">My sister and I were the youngest, by far. </sentence><sentence id="316">And I guess we cried and got lice and people were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="317">And my grandfather felt that he just could not do that. </sentence><sentence id="318">That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live. </sentence><sentence id="319"> https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="320"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 10 August 9, 2012 So he decided to take us. </sentence><sentence id="321">He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. </sentence><sentence id="322">He dressed himself as a Polish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. </sentence><sentence id="323">I guess according to my grandfather, I had blond hair and dark eyes. </sentence><sentence id="324">My sister had light hair and gray eyes. </sentence><sentence id="325">And he took us both and he went to the <span class="building">local market</span>, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. </sentence><sentence id="326">Dr. Gruen was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="327">I think he was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an <span class="building">orphanage</span> for Catholic children. </sentence><sentence id="328">And he looked for, but he couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="329">And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn't find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was ready, he was ready to leave us in the <span class="building">market</span>, thinking somebody would find us and keep us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="331">And keep us alive during the war. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="332">But just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. </sentence><sentence id="333">A Polish Catholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. </sentence><sentence id="334">And my grandfather had helped her with her horse and <span class="spatial object">carriage</span> business. </sentence><sentence id="335">So she saw him and recognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. </sentence><sentence id="336">And of course she said she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and he couldn't find Dr. Gruen. </sentence><sentence id="337">And at that point, he said could you take them. </sentence><sentence id="338">And my grandmother had had to sell her <span class="building">house</span> because the people she had working for her were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="339">And they were all in the <span class="populated place">ghetto</span> and so she couldn't make a living. </sentence><sentence id="340">So she started working as a cook for a retired engineer and his wife, the Szwarezynskis, somewhere in the <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="341">It must have been near <span class="populated place">Lvov</span>. </sentence><sentence id="342">And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were her sister's children. </sentence><sentence id="343">Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the <span class="country">Ukraine</span> and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to <span class="country">Ukraine</span> and left their babies with her. </sentence><sentence id="344">And then she asked Mrs. Szwarezynski could she, could grandma take both. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="345">And Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. </sentence><sentence id="346">But she couldn't take a six month old baby. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="347">So my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this <span class="building">orphanage</span>. </sentence><sentence id="348">And apparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the <span

id="373">I remember that we picked <span class="env feature">dandelions</span> together. </sentence><sentence id="374">And she made me a wreath out of <span class="env feature">dandelions</span>. </sentence><sentence id="375">And I remember putting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. </sentence><sentence id="376">And this I was told later. </sentence><sentence id="377">That grandma had gone <span class="building">home</span>, thinking that I had probably gone <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="378">And when she didn't find me there, she was standing outside waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="379">And ready to go look for me with Mrs. Szwarczynski. </sentence><sentence id="380">And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="381">And so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told her to stay calm. </sentence><sentence id="382">And the soldier came and at that point I can't, I don't know but I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="383">And so grandma was just unbelievably relieved. </sentence><sentence id="384">And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he found me there. </sentence><sentence id="385">And I reminded him of his children back <span class="building">home</span> and so he was bringing me to the closest <span class="building">house</span> because he was sure that's where I lived. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="386">So some kind of way later he had the picture

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 12 August 9, 2012 Well anyway then we were still there with the <span

outdoors and fed with a long stick. </sentence><sentence id="395">And one day, again this I was told. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="396">One day the dog was outside and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to scream again. </sentence><sentence id="397">And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and petted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies. </sentence><sentence id="398">Now what I do remember is that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the <span class="spatial object">table</span> with the dog. </sentence><sentence id="399">Now one possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn't remove the Nazi's leg because he had bitten a Nazi before. </sentence><sentence id="400">The other possibility, although it's fairly remote is that they suspected I was a Jewish child. </sentence><sentence id="401">But I think that's fairly remote because they were a bit anti- Semitic also. </sentence><sentence id="402">And my, there was a woman on the <span class="dlf">street</span> near where the Szwarczynskis lived who had told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child. </sentence><sentence id="403">So the Nazis came and took her and she was imprisoned. </sentence><sentence id="404">And tortured. </sentence><sentence id="405">And my grandfather of course found out about that and he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="406">We have to get my wife out. </sentence><sentence id="407">And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="408">Szwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look you know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don't know what we're going to do because we need her. </sentence><sentence id="409">And she certainly is not hiding any Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="410">And the commandant's wife talked to her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from <span class="building">prison</span> and told not to talk about it to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="411">And she was released and came back. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="412">Now what I remember I had -- I was in kind of a <span class="spatial
