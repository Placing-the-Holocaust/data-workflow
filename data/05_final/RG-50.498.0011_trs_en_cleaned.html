<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A" As | said, | spoke to him for the first time and that made my historical education, knowing what happened in <span class="country">Germany</span> so but influenced | do not know, | did not influenced him because | explained my mother-in-law when | met her, | think | met her a year later, after we met and she was a person looking not what a person as a social function but what is a person itself. </sentence><sentence id="2">She loved me very much; but this is both things together, she is Jewish, | am German whose Father was in the German Army, the fact that we took part in the political life that was an opportunity that in <span class="country">Germany</span> Kurt Kiesinger a propagandist and member of the Party was elected as German Chancellor, so all together we had prepared and | had been informed by him what was <span class="country">Nazi Germany</span>, he knowing that German Youth was not guilty, he always said : you know as you are German you have to take your responsibility, because <span class="country">Germany</span> is not all bad they have a heritage of marvelous musicians and writers, there are men of good and bad, and this pushed me very much and | think | took my responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="3">| gave him what he hoped, | was somebody German who decided to act. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: | think he believed that when 2 people meet there is a 2 way influence, | don't think one influences the other, it works both ways. </sentence><sentence id="9">That is why | askthe question but | don't know my answer. </sentence><sentence id="10">When you started to work on your Kiesinger case were you in the <span class="building">Youth German Office</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: Yes, | learned in <span class="country">France</span> that the <span class="building">German Youth Office</span> opened in <span class="populated place">Paris</span> | sent my cv and | was taken as a secretary, nothing else, so | belonged to the founding members of this <span class="building">French German Youth Office</span>, my work was not such an interesting one, my day as a German what was of interest to me was to work in an <span class="building">Institution</span> where there was Youth of both <span class="country">countries</span>, to learn and at this time in 1966 when Kiesinger was elected. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="15"> Q Would you be so kind to trll us the story of the Kiesinger case. </sentence><sentence id="16">How did it start from your point of view, how it developed and of course the story of your involvement. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: When | saw in the newspapers in <span class="country">Germany</span> that the new Chancellor was a member of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="18"> the Nazi Party and adjoined to the Hitler propaganda for <span class="country">foreign countries</span> , Serge said to me Beata there are some moments you can do something and he wrote for me a "<span class="spatial object">tribune</span>" in French and | brought these free <span class="spatial object">tribunes</span> to a <span class="building">French newspaper</span> at this yime called Combat, it was a left newspaper, and so | was embarrassing to the Chief that | was a German who took the opportunity to let us know in a French newspaper that there was somebody in <span class="country">France</span> who could not allow this man to represent the German news and will be the representative for the German government, so they published 3 <span class="spatial object">tribunes</span> and stated the German news can recognize a man, Willie Brandt, who was a freedom fighter but never a man like Kiesinger who is a danger to democracy in <span class="country">Germany</span> and in one of the articles | said | was fired from my <span class="building">German-French news office</span> as | had signed with my name not as belonging to the <span class="building">German-French news office</span>, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="19"> There was no reason for them to fire me, besides that they were against what | said and | was fired from one day to the other, this was finally the moment for me to decide if we are going ahead. </sentence><sentence id="20">The letter we received said if you take back what you said in the  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="21"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection article you can continue to work in our <span class="building">Institution</span>, and we said NO. </sentence><sentence id="22">Then Serge remembered when his Father was deported he had a friend who came back who told my Mother-in-law when the Kapo was beating him my Father-in-law defended him and he was sent to the <span class="dlf">coal mines</span> in retaliation and we said if my Father-in-law could in a situation where he was in danger of death resist to the Germans in a <span class="populated place">camp,</span> an <span class="populated place">Democratic Partyextermination camp</span>, how can we not resist and continue our campaign against Kiesinger, and so this was our decision, my husband was working at this time having a salary, | was fired and he helped me not only with advises but also with money and we started a campaign. </sentence><sentence id="23">| went to <span class="country">Germany</span> to see members of the <span class="building">Parliament</span> and Journalists, students, in order to say you know the situation where you have to protest, it is the first time after the war that the German Government is ruled by a Nazi and there is not a lot of involvement, Answers stated that he had been elected democratically and let's go. </sentence><sentence id="24">This was finally the decision that Serge and myself reached, so in order to say we can not do anything legally thn we have to change and discuss what to do. </sentence><sentence id="25">First interruptions in the <span class="building">Parliament</span> when Kiesinger spoke, and | was arrested and there were news in the newspapers and they had to tell why | was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="26">The second attack was when we learned that there was going to be a Congress of the Christian Democratic Party in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, very controversial because the students had protested stating that this Party will never have a meeting in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="27">Will not take place At this time another lie, big demonstrations took place about that this Congress will not take place, so we decided something can be done in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> at the International Congress of the Party; so | left <span class="populated place">Paris</span> without preparation besides having a photograph of somebody who promised to pick me and take me to the <span class="building">Congress Hall</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="28">So | arrived, not knowing what to do as we had forwarded all the documents against Kiesinger and distributed all over, so | was known as the woman attacking Kiesinger for being the German Chancellor and that is all, you learn in experimenting and it took about 4-5 days, so | had to go to Press meetings, to Conference Public meetings; | was unable to approach Kiesinger close enough to slap him, the action we had we had prepared to place the young generation against the older generation and slap somebody is not so easy, | did not want to do it in a <span class="interior space">hotel hall</span> where you only face each other; we had to have the support of the public and the media and so the last day of the Congress, at closing and when Kiesinger had to deliver his last speech | had the chance with the card of a journalist to enter the <span class="building">Hall</span> and to be in a situation across the <span class="building">Hall</span> finding myself behind him and so when all these possibilities are given | took my courage and yelled " Nazi go out" and slap him, he turn back to me and it was dangerous for me because in the first raw he had his bodyguards, but with him standing behind me they could not shoot, he had no idea of what happened to him, who | was because as | said it was not the first time that | brought his Nazi past, | was arrested , then there was a discussion: " let her go because | was sexually not satisfied", a crazy woman, but it could not take because | was known with all my documents ,so he was obliged to suit me and | was put in <span class="building">jail</span>, condemned the same day to 1 year in <span class="building">jail</span> without suspension, and as | said before, it was in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> the <span class="populated place">City</span> ruled by the Allies, | was a French Citizen, |  https://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="29"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection am German and French, and if arrested | could claim my French Citizenship and ask to see the French Commander of <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to be transferred in front of a <span class="building">French Court</span> and this was the argument told when | was condemned and | told my lawyer, who was a lawyer of the opposition at this time and his name was ?? </sentence><sentence id="30"><span class="region">Mar</span>,,? </sentence><sentence id="31">| told him to go tomorrow to see the French Commander, | think that because of the embarrassing situation he asked for " interruption ". </sentence><sentence id="32">| called <span class="building">home</span> and said | will be released because they announced it immediately that this was the decision, the next step would be the trial and we had prepared documents, as at this time we did not want a trial of the slap but the trial of Keisinger. </sentence><sentence id="33">| went to the <span class="building">Center of Jewish Documentation</span> in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, there in the <span class="interior space">history section</span> worked Joseph Billick?? </sentence><sentence id="34">Who had done Russian studies in <span class="country">Germany</span>, Philosophy and Mathematics, was a historian in the <span class="building">Center</span> and | asked: was | right to slap Kiesinger for his past? </sentence><sentence id="35">And he said YES, and he came with us to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> to be a moral witnwss, the Doctors were so afraid that now as a historian he would be allowed to talk about the Nazi Party, so they cancelled for the time being stating that it would take a couple of months, then W. Brandt came to power and | was amnestied, but | continued to work against Kiesinger because he was running for President of the <span class="building">Legislative body</span> in 69, | slap him in 68 on November 7, and | joined the Leftist Party, the Communist Student Peace Movement and | said | will be in the spot that Kiesinger was running for in the <span class="building">Parliament</span> and | was an official candidate able to follow him in the National campaign and where he came to speak | was there with my friends and we started shouting Kiesinger a Nazi and he had to resign and finally his party lost, he had to leave and W, Brandt replaced him. </sentence><sentence id="36">Even then not only my slap but my <span class="env feature">campaigh</span>, and at this timel had not succeeded before to mobilize the German Youth, the slap was a big thing because, in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, at the end of the Congress, the Youngs had not succeeded on the issue that the Congress should not take place and for them the slap was a satisfaction, | had a lot of students of the left behind me and at the meetings he could not speak because the shouts and rumors of the student's opposition and | guess it had made an impression on the German public. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="37"> Q | believe your article from Combat in which you praised W.Brandt was somehow premonitory because what he did later in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span> show you were right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Yes, certainly, and at the time W. Brandt was already out and had tried several times to become Chancellor and had a lot of problems and | was leading a campaign for him in <span class="country">France</span>, for W </sentence></p><p><sentence id="39"> Q | would like to go back for 1 second to the moment of the slap, were you afraid? </sentence><sentence id="40">It was an act of courage. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Much more afraid to succeed, in the time before | was able to??,,? </sentence><sentence id="42">Must act in the moment, | was not sure I'll have the courage, not courage the reflex to slap, because if you are in front of a big <span class="interior space">room</span>, a lot of people and you have to slap a man because at this time for me he was a Nazi, but if you slap a man before you, so, but in the moment you  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection have to act we never failed because it is the whole preparation, at the beginning we were completely alone and now we had a group around us, sons and daughters of the deported Jews from <span class="country">France</span>, but we always were alone and had to prepare the <span class="spatial object">files</span>, do research, tie our leaflets, we never had a Press Attache who said Mrs. Karsfeld you have to go to this spot, it was always by ourselves, you have as they say in French " <span class="spatial object">debrouiller</span>" an this was so. </sentence><sentence id="43">END OF FIRST TAPE. </sentence><sentence id="44">RG50-498-0011-02-05 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: So you can say Kiesinger was your first case? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Yes, it was it was my first case and the most spectacular and certainly the most important for me as a German because it was the slap given by all the Germans who fought with me against him and it was the slap against the Nazi generation, and as | always say even killing Kiesinger would not had the impact on public opinion as a slap, because it was in relation to thos who had voted for him who had decided to vote for him as a Premier Minister, and | think it is something | never accomplished again and it was a decision of the moment, it succeeded and for that I'll certainly end up in German history and though the German Politicians of today generation are very much opposed, even today, to the gesture; but | also became known in <span class="country">Israel</span> and among the <span class="region">Jewish world</span>, was proposed for a Nobel Peace Prize, | think that this gesture in <span class="country">Germany</span> has shown that there is a new generation as W. Brandt and | could not have prepared myself for this from books, but could prepare with " civil courage" as they say in <span class="country">Germany</span> and | succeeded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: It was very symbolic! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Yes, it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Am | correct to say that the next case was the Achenbacker case blocking the nomination of Achenbacker to the Economic European Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Can you describe for us this case, please. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: As we had worked out the documents, we saw that Achenbacker was in the <span class="building">German Rmbassy</span>, in the <span class="building">Political service</span> and had been sending Telexes concerning the deportation of French Jews and Foreign Jews, and had signed telegrams, so we had known, we met the name of Achenbacker in the <span class="spatial object">archives</span> together with the search about Kiesinger and then we learned after W. Brandt becme Chancellor and was part of the Liberal Party in the <span class="building">Parliament</span> and Achenbacker was a member of the Liberal Party, he had to make some processes in order to  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection have a big coalition, so we said a man like Achenbacker cannot be in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> together with all those from <span class="country">countries</span> which had been ruled by German occupiers and it has to be a morality and we cannot take as a German Commissioner a man like Achenbacker, and | collected all the documents concerning Achenbacker and | went to see 6 members of the German Economic Unit and | went to see them in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> and <span class="country">France</span> and said you know we have to take a decision and finally under the scandal the Germans said Mr. Achenbacker is replaced by Mr. Arendorf who became, up io ioday the Ambassador to <span class="populated place">London</span>. </sentence><sentence id="66">So again, it was our decision to do something in order to avoid that a Nazi could be in <span class="populated place">Brussels</span> to change the spirit of the European Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: If my recollection is correct you were not arrested in the Achenbacker case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: No, | took my son Arno, at that time he was small. </sentence><sentence id="73">When | was in <span class="country">Germany</span> where | had my meetings, campaigning against Kiesinger, my Mother-in- Law was often in charge of Arno when | was away, so | decided to take him with me, he was with me against Kiesinger. </sentence><sentence id="74">| remember there was a picture in the German newspapers, the 3 more important candidates, it was Kiesinger, Klafster and Brandt, and <span class="populated place">Karsfeld</span> was Arno. </sentence><sentence id="75">Even when we followed Kiesinger in the campaign, the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> of journalists following his <span class="spatial object">Mercedes</span> and | with some of my group in 1 or 2 <span class="spatial object">cars</span>, and the journalists said : " you know why Mrs. Karsfeld had to follow, we could take her in the <span class="spatial object">bus</span> with the media which could be a good gesture, but | am afraid that Arno could bite me." </sentence></p><p><sentence id="76"> Q It was nice historically, if | may say so, to name your son after your Father-in-Law who perished in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: This is Jewish law and my daughter is named after an aunt, sister of my mother-in-law who also died in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="78">When my daughter was born she was called Lidia but the diminutive was Lida and my daughter is called Lida. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: The Lischka case was about his high responsibility for the fate of the Jews of <span class="country">France</span>, the German who had helped with the Vichy government had decided the arrest and deportation of the Jews from <span class="country">France</span>, 76,000 were deported, and after the Achenbacker case we learned that Brandt was signing a new treaty with <span class="country">France</span> in order to obtain the possibility to dash the discriminaters of the 200 sentences after the war by the <span class="building">military courts</span>, but there were no ways to sentence them because as German citizens in <span class="country">France</span> they asked to extradite them, but as German citizens they were not expelled to <span class="country">France</span>, at this time the <span class="building">French Military Courts</span> could still sentence them, and the French after the war had in a first review asked the German not to take care of them because they were afraid that sentencing them, in <span class="country">Germany</span> in <span class="building">military courts</span> in absentia, to life in <span class="building">prison</span> or to death, but never caught, but <span class="country">Germany</span> sentencing them to life, so there was a kind of blocking therefore no sentences in <span class="country">France</span> or <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="103">We had to find a solution. </sentence><sentence id="104">The treaty between both <span class="country">countries</span> was signed and now needed the ratification by the <span class="building">German Parliament</span> and who was blocking this ratification our friend Achenbacker leader of our Party, lobbying to stop all persecutions of these criminals, so we started a campaign to, with slightly illegal actions, we showed the big scandal and we started to assemble around us militants, Jews, fighters, deportees, and our action was to oblige first the <span class="building">German Parliament</span> to ratify the treaty and the needs then went to <span class="country">Germany</span> to demonstrate in front of the <span class="building">office</span> stating that Lischka was the former Chief of Police in <span class="country">France</span>, he was already the Chief of the Gestapo in <span class="country">Germany</span>; in order to obtain the ratification, friends, young Jews in <span class="country">Germany</span> demonstrated about the real criminals, ex-criminals to be put in <span class="building">German jails</span> or expelled whatever but nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="105">The public opinion and the press at this time was much more  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection favorable to us stating that the situation was not supportable, <span class="country">France</span> also said how is it possible that <span class="country">Germany</span> lets the criminals free and and in <span class="country">Israel</span> you can imgine the <span class="building">Press</span>, and we had a couple of years to fight and finally the treaty was ratified, Mr. Achenbacker was expelled from his position as President of Commission of Foreigh Affairs and then we had to struggle again with the German Justice yo obtain the trial of Lischka who was a former Chief with <span class="populated place">Eichman</span> and ?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: You are certainly right saying that the Bousquet case was highly symbolic because it exposed one of the important institutions of the Vichy Government the Police, and the same was probably the case of Paul Touvier who represented the Militia and in this case too you were involved and your husband. </sentence><sentence id="272">Can you say a few words about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: It was my son who took over to represent most of the associated plaintiffs in the case of Paul Touvier, but | remember it was about 20 years ago, he was still hiding with a group of (???) </sentence><sentence id="276">International League against ??? </sentence><sentence id="277">anti Semitic, he was still living near <span class="populated place">Chambery</span> we were demonstrating in front of his <span class="building">house</span> but he had already left because he was hiding among the ? </sentence><sentence id="278">integrus? </sentence><sentence id="279"><span class="building">Catholic Church</span>, they were harboring him, he had already at this time to protest???????and he was amnestied by President Pompidoul at this time as you remember President Mitterand also had said in different cases no more trials against French Collaborators, of French High Officials in order not to embarrass the Civil Peace in <span class="country">France</span>, that was the explanation given, not to divide the French population pro and anti <span class="populated place">Vichy</span> and so we started at this time and ha was arrested and even though when arrested in the <span class="region">South part</span> of <span class="country">France</span> and the Police from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> came over because the Police of the <span class="region">Cote D'Azur</span> did not want yo act, there was information going around , because the Police told us the KLARSFELD GANG will come and kidnap him, so the Police in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, so our fame, but the most important | think is the trial when my son defended most of the associated plaintiffs. </sentence><sentence id="280">It was stated that: In the case he decided to execute the Jews because they were Jewish and in this case he did not act under the Germans but took this direction himself and this was a big struggle for the defending <span class="dlf">line</span> of Paul Touvier who was sentenced to life imprisonment. </sentence><sentence id="281"> </sentence></p></dialogue>
