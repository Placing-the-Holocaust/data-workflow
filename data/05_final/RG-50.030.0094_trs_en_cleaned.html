<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: Yes, my grandparents were living. </sentence><sentence id="2">That is to say uh I I got to know and meet one from each side of the family. </sentence><sentence id="3">Uh I knew my grandmother Dana (ph) who was my father's mother, and even better I knew my mother's father, whose name was Jacob Kramer and uh he lived with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Could you tell me what your early childhood was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, my early childhood was not unusual for an immigrant family. </sentence><sentence id="10">Even though I was born in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, I was barely born in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>. </sentence><sentence id="11">My parents escaped from <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> earlier the same year that I was born which was 1933.And uh they settled in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> at at for them a very bad time. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was the midst of a de...depression and uh they could barely escape with what little possessions they had. </sentence><sentence id="13">They were relatively young married couple so they had a hard time economically and as I say they they worked together pretty well. </sentence><sentence id="14">And my father stitched together little bit of this and a little bit of that so that they could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="15">And so actually I was raised more by my grandfather in in that period of my life than by either parents and I liked my grandfather a whole lot better for that reason because since my father worked out of the <span class="building">home</span>, why it was always shush here and shush there and don't touch and and make scarce. </sentence><sentence id="16">And grandfather, Opa (ph) I called him, Opa Kramer, uh he took time. </sentence><sentence id="17">He had the time. </sentence><sentence id="18">He was retired so uh he dragged him around with him and really had more of an influence probably on my early education, <span class="building">preschool</span>, than my parents. </sentence><sentence id="19">I remember usually in the mornings, he would take me to the <span class="dlf">playground</span> just to get away from being under foot at <span class="building">home</span> and in the afternoon he'd take me to his pinochle game. </sentence><sentence id="20">So the mornings he made like a child and in the afternoon I made like a grandparent and sat very quietly on the <span class="spatial object">chairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="21">I watched the old, old men, all refugees from <span class="country">Germany</span>, play pinochle and drink tea and tell stories and that's how I grew up bilingual, at least bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="22">Uh my father was in a in a very international type of of occupation and there were always people from all over coming to our <span class="building">house</span> because that's, as I said, where my dad conducted his business. </sentence><sentence id="23">Early in the morning already, my mother was an excellent hostess. </sentence><sentence id="24">She made, was well-known for her breakfasts so people who came in on the morning <span class="spatial object">train</span> from <span class="populated place">Paris</span> would come in and sit down at our at our <span class="spatial object">table</span> and and uh talk, chit chat, and talk business. </sentence><sentence id="25">My This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="26">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="27"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection father was an excellent linguist. </sentence><sentence id="28">He was equally at <span class="building">home</span> in German and in French and in Italian and in Dutch, and his English was quite good as well. </sentence><sentence id="29">He has a classical education. </sentence><sentence id="30">He spoke uh uh could could certainly read fluently Latin and Greek, so it it was a very actually lively I would say and international experience that I was exposed to. </sentence><sentence id="31">So even though my father had a very strict rule because he was really upset that uh the <span class="country">country</span> that he loved so dearly, <span class="country">Germany</span>, went for such for such crazy and criminal theories and activities as took place under Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="32">He had a very strict rule. </sentence><sentence id="33">No German. </sentence><sentence id="34">Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="35">They uh, my father went to to the trouble of translating German nursery rhymes and songs, children's songs he didn't know any Dutch ones and I don't why he didn't take the trouble to learn. </sentence><sentence id="36">Maybe that's hard for parents. </sentence><sentence id="37">At any rate uh the way out that he choose was he kept uh the German songs and nursery rhymes and just translated them. </sentence><sentence id="38">And uh made my mother uh sing or recite the translations. </sentence><sentence id="39">Which she did faithfully while he was around but it was much easier for her to do it in the original German, and so I learned them both ways, and of course my grandfather didn't pay any attention to what made my father said about that and uh as soon as we were out of ear shot, that was the language he talked to me. </sentence><sentence id="40">So as I say I was really raised bilingual and bicultural. </sentence><sentence id="41">But that had to be subrosa because we had to hide it from my dad because the the outside effect that we were to give is that we were a Dutch family and uh he wanted to forget about ever having been German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Can you describe the changes in your family life and in the daily routine after the Nazis invaded the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> but efore you left <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="81">Well, of course, things went very much in stages. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think a lot of people who've who've lived through that have have explained it pretty much the same way. </sentence><sentence id="83">Uh the Germans, the Nazis, and it's hard to make that distinction, uh because the Nazis swept everyone along with them, uh the Germans when they invaded the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> uh were an occupying power and in in the beginning made a real effort I think to kind of get the population on their side. </sentence><sentence id="84">So uh our first reaction when we saw that <span class="country">Holland</span> was uh going to be lost from the standpoint of of the fortunes of war, uh my father tried to pack up the family and we went, we jumped in a <span class="spatial object">taxicab</span> that he managed to secure This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="85">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="86"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection somehow, and uh drove across the narrow neck of the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> to the <span class="populated place">harbor city</span> of , where uh we heard that they were sending <span class="spatial object">refugee boats</span> to pick up people, but we came just an hour too late maybe. </sentence><sentence id="87">At that time they were already blowing up the <span class="dlf">harbor installations</span> and one of my earliest recollections is just seeing the whole <span class="region">harbor area</span> of go up in flames. </sentence><sentence id="88">The reason that was so impressive is they had <span class="spatial object">oil storage tanks</span> there and uh of course that burned quite effectively lots of fire, lots of smoke. </sentence><sentence id="89">And uh a Dutch trooper at the edge of turned us back and said it's too late and sent us back to <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>. </sentence><sentence id="90">And then we were really scared because we saw <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> burning too but they were blowing up the <span class="spatial object">oil storage tanks</span> there too in the <span class="dlf">harbor</span> and so uh once we got back things got fairly well back to normal never completely because you know there was an occupying power in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="91">And again some of my earliest recollection is walking to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="92">At the time we we Jewish kids were still going to the regular <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="93">There was no thought of of segregating us. </sentence><sentence id="94">Uh but the Nazis one time just just for fun uh ran one of their uh uh <span class="spatial object">personnel carriers</span> up on the <span class="dlf">sidewalk</span> just to watch the kids scurry. </sentence><sentence id="95">So they they were very much uh an occupying power and then gradually started tightening the screws, obviously first a little tighter on the Jews and and uh but right behind it on the rest of the population until at the very end no one, Jewish or non-Jewish, escaped extreme depravation. </sentence><sentence id="96">I mean the Jews were deported and gassed, but the rest of the people had a very hard time as well. </sentence><sentence id="97">And uh after the war, you know, I I went back to the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> for about a half a year, and one of the interesting, for me, things that I did was I joined a <span class="building">therapy group</span> because I'm having a hard time living all this stuff down. </sentence><sentence id="98">And I figured, in Dutch, on the scene, that might help me quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="99">And there were some people in there my age and when raised that this was an issue for me, the subject completely switched from all the troubles they had at <span class="building">home</span> and the troubles that they had at <span class="building">work</span>, and they were completely there with me, talking about uh the experiences in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, because no one came off free from it. </sentence><sentence id="100">But you know the early experiences that I had for example is that the Nazis, the Germans hard to hard to distinguish as I say built a <span class="dlf">wall</span> down the center of my <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="101">One side for the Jewish kids, one side for the non-Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="102">And uh that was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="103">Usually they picked one <span class="building">school</span> for the Jews and another <span class="building">school</span> for the non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="104">That that's how how it was dramatized that things This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="105">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="106"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection were happening, things that were happening that segregated out the Jews and that I was one of them and that I was in trouble. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the events leading up to your departure from <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="141">Right. </sentence><sentence id="142">Well, uh as I say, tightening the screws was done on my family in a very dramatic way in that uh they first pulled my dad's work permit so that my dad, who was very much in the public eye uh giving lectures at <span class="building">public museums</span>, going to auctions and so forth, couldn't openly do that anymore. </sentence><sentence id="143">So I uh I heard it's hard to know after all I was six, seven years old it's hard to know what I remember and what I'm reconstructing from what people tell me but I think I was very well aware that my father was uh having troubles with his business and where these troubles were coming from, that he had to do double bookkeeping and work out tricks with his friends so they could stay on in business and make it appear that he really was not. </sentence><sentence id="144">Uh they actually came to raid our place several times. </sentence><sentence id="145">First they came for silver and gold and the usual things that uh that they that they liked to steal, which was always done in very formal way, with receipts and stamps and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="146">Uh and uh later on they came by <span class="dlf">stages</span> to steal my dad's art collection which was his stock for for his <span class="building">dealership</span> in in art, and I remember the first time they came around they they sent the <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> police. </sentence><sentence id="147">Those people must have really been in a very you know almost untenable position because they didn't want to do this. </sentence><sentence id="148">But they were made to do it and they had to work somehow and they were the police. </sentence><sentence id="149">They were taken over. </sentence><sentence id="150">So I remember when they came, my dad was out. </sentence><sentence id="151">He wasn't even supposed to be out of the <span class="populated place">city</span> because he wasn't even allowed to ride <span class="spatial object">public transportation</span> anymore in those days. </sentence><sentence id="152">So uh mother made up a story as to where he was, and uh the police did everything they do to to calm her down they said don't worry about it uh, we don't even like to do this job but we have to do it, and they said if there is anything particular you'd like to do before we start our work, that's fine. </sentence><sentence id="153">Now this was a hint to her that if she wanted to make one of those <span class="spatial object">paintings</span> that they knew were were around disappear, they wouldn't mind. </sentence><sentence id="154">But you didn't know who you could trust, so here again I'm telling you part of what I remember, part of what I reconstruct but I still remember my mother taking one of those paintings, a little This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="155">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="156"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection one, and just letting her coat drop over it and see what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they pretended like it wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="158">So gradually every time she'd pass through the <span class="building">house</span> she she pushed that that painting further and further until she finally pushed it into a <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="159">Then they came and listed everything on official forms and sealed it in the <span class="interior space">closet</span>. </sentence><sentence id="160">Put the seal of the city of <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> on our on our <span class="interior space">hall closet</span>, and that was the end of my dad's stock. </sentence><sentence id="161">Most of it they didn't get, but they got four or five good <span class="spatial object">paintings</span> which we've tried to in the interim to get back, unsuccessfully. </sentence><sentence id="162">The stuff that we got back was all saved for us by friends and neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="163">But uh the stuff that was confiscated, including my own <span class="spatial object">bicycle</span>, we never got back. </sentence><sentence id="164">And how people can sit with wellknown pieces of art, because my dad dealt in good stuff, that they know is stolen, this very day is hard to believe. </sentence><sentence id="165">So you know the Holocaust goes on because people did not make restitution, not in a general way. </sentence><sentence id="166">But the your question was what changed? </sentence><sentence id="167">Well, uh what what changed then uh is that the action against property changed to action against people. </sentence><sentence id="168">Now first they called up the the young folks and they told them, I remember I had a uh friend of the family that that played with me quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="169">Uh he was he was called up and he was glad to go because in the beginning it was not at all clear what was happening to people that were being called up for uh work related uh for war related work in <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="170">They told these folks uh, come work for us a half a year and we'll let you go to <span class="country">Palestine</span>. </sentence><sentence id="171">And so the kids were were anxious to go. </sentence><sentence id="172">And they went willingly. </sentence><sentence id="173">Sent letters back, sent letters back on a regular basis. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when the letters stopped coming my parents knew. </sentence><sentence id="175">They knew even though nobody ever really said this out loud. </sentence><sentence id="176">So it was still a surprise the first day when they started picking up people in the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="177">And my father ran into one of those uh <span class="dlf">street</span> raids but fortunately he had a lot of friends and uh one of the <span class="building">stores</span> that he was dealing with, one of the <span class="building">neighborhood stores</span>, the storekeeper pulled him off the <span class="dlf">street</span> and says you don't want to go there. </sentence><sentence id="178">They're loading up Jews. </sentence><sentence id="179">So he had he hid him behind the <span class="spatial object">counter</span> and then after after curfew the Germans set an eight o'clock curfew on Jews in those days uh he slipped <span class="building">home</span> and thought that that things were at least in the short run going to be better when they made a night raid on our <span class="dlf">block</span>. </sentence><sentence id="180">And uh my dad was trapped, because uh it was very clear that they were coming at us from all sides, and uh that there was, that you couldn't just walk away from it. </sentence><sentence id="181">So my dad decided to go out over the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and you know one of one of the real uh high grabbing experiences that that I have to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="182">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="183"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection deal with is that I heard him discuss what some of the options were. </sentence><sentence id="184">His friends came over because they were worried. </sentence><sentence id="185">People took took risks. </sentence><sentence id="186">They, Dutch people supported their Jewish friends, discussed what the options were, decided to go up over the <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="187">I had been told over and over again, don't go on the <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="188">And, but I knew just how to climb out the <span class="dlf">window</span> and get on the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and I knew he was going to do that and try to escape over the <span class="dlf">roof</span> and I was really worried. </sentence><sentence id="189">Nobody said word one to me, except they suddenly noticed I was standing there. </sentence><sentence id="190">Somebody grabbed me, pushed me in <span class="spatial object">bed</span>, pulled the covers over me even though I was protesting that I didn't put on my pajamas yet, and said you be quiet and you act like you're asleep. </sentence><sentence id="191">And uh just about that time I heard the uh raiding parties stomp up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>. </sentence><sentence id="192">They, they the the real Nazis did everything they did loud, so you could always tell when they were Nazis and Nazi sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="193">They would "Hail Hitler" real loud, and they had that opportunity cause we, unfortunately, had downstairs neighbors that were Nazi sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="194">When theysaw those raiders coming in, they opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> and spent a lot of time hailing and and shouting at each other in the <span class="interior space">hall</span>, which was good cause it gave my dad extra time to get out. </sentence><sentence id="195">Finally they stomped up the <span class="dlf">stairs</span>, stomped on the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="196">Finally one of my dad's friends let them in and quite innocently asked what they wanted, and although they screamed real loudly that they were looking for my dad and where was he and uh you know I heard my mother try to explain that she didn't know, maybe he had been picked up in the <span class="dlf">streets</span> she didn't know where my dad was. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I heard them get madder and madder at my mom and finally tell her that they were taking her. </sentence><sentence id="198">And uh so they did. </sentence><sentence id="199">They barely gave her a chance to take her <span class="spatial object">purse</span>. </sentence><sentence id="200">And uh they dragged her off and put her in one of their <span class="spatial object">paddy wagons</span> and hauled her off. </sentence><sentence id="201">Well, you said how, how did it happen then that you left <span class="populated place">town</span>. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, uh things were formal and crazy at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="203">There were rules for everything which were frequently broken and were up to the whim of which ever commander was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="204">My mother was taken to a <span class="building">theater</span> which was uh known as the <span class="country">Holland</span> , uh which which later became known as the because they they were no longer doing plays there. </sentence><sentence id="205">They were using this as a concentration point for for people that they picked up, for for you know, for the <span class="spatial object">shipment</span>. </sentence><sentence id="206">And uh while my mother was at this , at this <span class="building">theater</span>, uh she spotted a friend from across the <span class="dlf">street</span> uh whose daughter was quite friendly with uh his name was Fritz Salten (ph), and Fritz was uh working for the Jewish Council to try and and get some This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="207">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="208"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection comfort and and support for the people that had been arrested, detained or whatever word you want to use. </sentence><sentence id="209">And uh my mother called him over and said hey uh Fritz, is there any way we, I I can get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="210">And he said well, he says I know that your dad has done, well, she he would have said of course your husband, uh I know that your husband has done work for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>. </sentence><sentence id="211">They're letting people off sometimes uh that whose relatives worked for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>. </sentence><sentence id="212">Why don't you try that? </sentence><sentence id="213">And so, uh through Fritz we we got a letter in the right format saying that my dad had done work as a teacher for the for the <span class="building">Jewish Council</span>, and uh was the was the famous commander, infamous commander of of that uh particular operation, let my mother go. </sentence><sentence id="214">The only one he let go that day. </sentence><sentence id="215">So that's why I say things were very arbitrary. </sentence><sentence id="216">That day he decided to honor that particular rule. </sentence><sentence id="217">So I mean my parents couldn't have it dramatized very much more uh extremely that it was time to get out of there, but where to go. ( </sentence><sentence id="218">Cough) My my parents had one real close uh couple who were their friends whom they had asked already prelude to that time to kind of scout around a little bit and just find anything that might work to get us out of there. </sentence><sentence id="219">And that was just in the beginning of some negotiation with with with them, very shadowy group uh who had had one front person by the name of drink a moment whom Franz, that's the husband of that couple, had coincidentally just gone to see the very night that uh that they raided our place. </sentence><sentence id="220">They were unaware that we were being raided. </sentence><sentence id="221">So they hurried up these negotiations and uh even though they seemed very haphazarded what apparently it would be is that uh they would, that this group then of adventurers would smuggle us south in a <span class="spatial object">gasoline truck</span> through <span class="country">Belgium</span>, through <span class="country">France</span>, up to a little <span class="populated place">enclave</span> known as <span class="populated place">Free France</span> uh which was kind of in between the uh occupied and nonoccupied areas of Europe, and which functioned as kind of a <span class="dlf">door</span>, a lastminute <span class="dlf">door</span> for people to escape. </sentence><sentence id="222">So in August of "42 when these events happened, uh we we left and went to the <span class="building">house</span> of this Ari Hayward (ph), again to to see you know what what he could arrange to get us away further, so those were the circumstances that led to our leaving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Would you tell me now from there on, the actual leaving and and the events that followed after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="314"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="315">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="316"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: Well, the hardest part I think for my parents in the leaving was that they had to leave my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="318">He was uh getting senile and diabetic and there was no question of making the run with him, so they left him in an <span class="building">oldage home</span> and it was very hard for us to leave him. </sentence><sentence id="319">Of course, they didn't tell me that we that we were going on the run. </sentence><sentence id="320">They told me that we were going on vacation, which was credible since it was August, the big vacation month in <span class="country">Europe</span>, and they said well, we're just going to go on vacation to this new friend of ours, Mr. Hayward, and uh you can play with his kids and uh and we hope we'll have a pretty good time. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh I didn't believe that but I also didn't have the nerve to ask what was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="322">And you know, later on I've I've given a lot of thought to this. </sentence><sentence id="323">Do you tell your kids what goes on if it's if it's tough news? </sentence><sentence id="324">And I've come to the conclusion that you do at least you tell a tenyear old. </sentence><sentence id="325">I was eight then. </sentence><sentence id="326">You tell an eight year old because eight year olds understand a whole lot. </sentence><sentence id="327">You don't need to tell them all the nitty gritty details, but you do need to tell them what's going on, because one of one of the most difficult things for me is the confusion. </sentence><sentence id="328">Hearing one thing and seeing another. </sentence><sentence id="329">Knowing that my parents were telling me stories. </sentence><sentence id="330">Don't want to say lies because they probably thought they were protecting me. </sentence><sentence id="331">Certainly thought that they were protecting me. </sentence><sentence id="332">But it was no protection. </sentence><sentence id="333">It was crazy making. </sentence><sentence id="334">It was crazy making. </sentence><sentence id="335">And we stayed uh with the the <span class="building">Haywards</span> a couple of weeks until the Nazis raided the place, and they lost their nerve, and they didn't have any alternatives ready, so those were very difficult weeks from uh oh from mid-August to uh mid-September when uh we just wandered the <span class="region">countryside</span> from one <span class="building">temporary shelter</span> to another until we finally wound

</sentence><sentence id="345">Suddenly the kid was there, and there was our food and then he would slink away and disappear. </sentence><sentence id="346">Well, this was obviously not anything that could go on. </sentence><sentence id="347">In fact one of the things that I remember is how extremely worried my dad was. </sentence><sentence id="348">We were having beautiful September weather, unusual for the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> nice warm sunny afternoons where we could go swimming. </sentence><sentence id="349">I mean it was great, in the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> right uh we had to go swimming actually cause we at that time had only uh the clothes that that uh that we carried with us on our back because we were on the move so much and uh while Dad and I went swimming uh my mother and the lady in the other couple that was hiding with us, uh did the <span class="spatial object">laundry</span> in the other end of the <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span>. </sentence><sentence id="350">Uh but as I was starting to say, my dad was complaining about the good weather cause he says how long can this weather last. </sentence><sentence id="351">When the cold weather comes, we'll freeze here. </sentence><sentence id="352">There was of course no way to heat the <span class="building">bath house</span> of a of a of a <span class="interior space">swimming pool</span> anda remote <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="353">So you know, when fall weather comes, particularly sunny weather, I find myself getting very uncomfortable and I have to remind myself you know, that that harks back to these times and I'm only recently able to enjoy beautiful fall weather because I keep telling people the bad (ph) winter is going to come. </sentence><sentence id="354">Now the the that is un a very bad position we were in because I, it was quite clear that these adventurers we, we tend to want to see people in terms of good or bad but that doesn't always work. </sentence><sentence id="355">These uh these people that Ari Hayward put us in contact with were good/bad. </sentence><sentence id="356">They probably had some good motivations and uh from most of the stories that I hear about them repeated talk about how much money and when are you going to pay us and so on. </sentence><sentence id="357">They were in it principally for the money. </sentence><sentence id="358">And they were in a bad place because they couldn't deliver. </sentence><sentence id="359">They had gotten their deposit I am now reconstructing uh it's very clear that they had gotten their deposit but uh my father and and his friend uh Heinz Graumann who with also a wife and son was hiding along with us I didn't trust him at all. </sentence><sentence id="360">I didn't give him any more money than he could get away with. </sentence><sentence id="361">I remember those discussions. </sentence><sentence id="362">And uh it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="363">There's a Dutch proverb that says little pictures have big ears. </sentence><sentence id="364">Uh this little picture had very big ears because I tried to find out as much as I could about what was going on because nobody was going to be telling me anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="365">Uh these people there, then these adventurers were in a bad way. </sentence><sentence id="366">What were they going to do with us? </sentence><sentence id="367">And as we know reconstructed, they decided to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="368">It had a number of advantages. </sentence><sentence id="369">First of all they knew This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection that if the Germans got a hold of us they would do more, they would do worse than kill us, and secondly since they had already figured out where Heinz and my dad were were keeping their money, they could get paid instantly and not have to take any more risks with us. </sentence><sentence id="372">So uh at the at that very time however the regular <span class="interior space">Dutch underground</span> was starting to make some contact with that nebulous group of adventurers, and uh while they were exploring ways to get rid of us, they also explored a way of handing us over to the regular <span class="interior space">Dutch underground</span> in that particular <span class="region">area</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> which was the <span class="region">southeastern corner</span>, east of &gt;&gt; And uh.....END OF TAPE -..so the story that they told us was that they had some people that maybe could help them and uh one by one they would they would uh which would which would be safer than herding a whole group of six people through the <span class="env feature">woods</span> one by one they would deliver us to these people, whereas at least a good portion of, at least two of these people were definitely decided on the <span class="dlf">murder route</span>. </sentence><sentence id="373">They uh took Michael, the the other boy that was hiding with us uh he was considerably older than I, I was I was eight and he was probably around fifteen or sixteen at the time they took him first and they did in fact kill him. </sentence><sentence id="374">And uh later on uh I was told they found <span class="dlf">graves</span> that, shallow <span class="dlf">graves</span>, that they had pre-dug for all us. </sentence><sentence id="375">So they were really serious about doing us in. </sentence><sentence id="376">But uh killing is hard. </sentence><sentence id="377">People uh that talk about killing say uh your first killing really is the hardest. </sentence><sentence id="378">When you see a a vibrant young boy that had just been laughing and joking with you and you suddenly split open his skull and you see his blood that does something to people. </sentence><sentence id="379">And from the testimony that uh came out in the trial afterwards, the person that uh swung the <span class="spatial object">shovel</span> that kill...killed Michael, came to trial after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="380">It was clear that uh that the gruesomeness of of actually having done the act uh helped deter them from killing the rest of us, and then they tried the route of handing us over to the regular <span class="interior space">underground</span>, which they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="452">After you were handed over to the <span class="interior space">underground</span>, what happened then? </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: Well, at at first we were still split up and uh my parents and I were brought to the <span class="building">house</span> of uh Harry Janssen, Janssen we would say in Dutch, uh a smallscale farmer and professional thrasher who lived in the <span class="region">outback</span> behind uh the <span class="populated place">village</span> of <span class="populated place">Durna</span> (ph) which as I say is east of and uh he was uh loosely connected with the <span class="interior space">underground</span>. </sentence><sentence id="459">The <span class="interior space">underground</span> has to be loosely connected or else it doesn't function in <span class="region">occupied territories</span>. </sentence><sentence id="460">And uh that was an interim placement. </sentence><sentence id="461">They were going to decide what to do next. </sentence><sentence id="462">And uh to our surprise, after a while, the Graumanns showed up there too, because the people that were supposed to have taken them in didn't and the last time we saw the members of this nebulous group of adventurers that I talked about was when they delivered the <span class="building">Graumanns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="463">Said they would come back for them and never did. </sentence><sentence id="464">And uh all the connections that were supposed to have worked for Harry to to get us away or out of the <span class="country">country</span> or whatever, didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="465">So he inherited us. </sentence><sentence id="466">And although he never expected to be hiding five Jews for any length of time, he did. </sentence><sentence id="467">And I think the relationship immediately became quite close because of course in the beginning, no one knew what had become of Michael. </sentence><sentence id="468">And uh Harry could see Elli Graumann, Michael's mother, wilting more and more each day, not knowing what had happened to her son. </sentence><sentence id="469">So he he uh he started the <span class="interior space">underground</span> into a manhunt. </sentence><sentence id="470">And they combed the place till they finally found one of the people of what I have been calling that nebulous group, and they nabbed himand interrogated him till they, till he told the truth, and showed where where Michael was buried. </sentence><sentence id="471">So that dramatized to Harry you know the the type of pickle that we were in, and I guess kind of gradually at first, week by week, he decided to to become the person to to shelter us, take charge of us. </sentence><sentence id="472">And he did that. </sentence><sentence id="473">He did this two years almost to the day till we were liberated, despite raids, despite searches specifically of his place, despite interrogation, this man was a master at dissimilation and withstanding uh interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="474">He could make up stories. </sentence><sentence id="475">He was a natural raconteur. </sentence><sentence id="476">We kids loved him because he could tell us kids stories too. </sentence><sentence id="477">A marvelous storyteller. </sentence><sentence id="478">That came in very handy for him, cause he'd make up some story and it always worked. </sentence><sentence id="479">Like one time I remember there was a search specifically of his place. </sentence><sentence id="480">They came to he he had his contacts and he had been warned uh that there would be a search of his place. </sentence><sentence id="481">And II had the measles. </sentence><sentence id="482">I was really sick. </sentence><sentence id="483">And you know we had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="484">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="485"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection various places that we would hide out when the word came that there'd be a search, but there was no question it would have been inhumane to stick me into one of these places so he stuck two of his kids uh about the same age in <span class="spatial object">bed</span> with me it was obvi...it was quite common in poor uh families for several kids to sleep together, but that was not the usual way that I slept. </sentence><sentence id="486">And the other two kids had the measles too I think, and so they they stuck them, he stuck them, all three of us, in in one of the <span class="interior space">bedrooms</span>, and put a big sign on the <span class="dlf">door</span>, "Quarantined", and so when the search party came through, he says feel free to look anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="487">I've got nothing to hide he says, but don't go in there. </sentence><sentence id="488">I've got some really sick kids in there, and the doctor put a sign on there "quarantined." </sentence><sentence id="489">I don't want you guys to get sick. </sentence><sentence id="490">So well after they made a perfunctory look inside and they say three real sick kids in there, threw the <span class="dlf">door</span> closed, and uh you know, he got us through just by talk. </sentence><sentence id="491">And even though he had some very very good places that he tried at various place, at various times to hide us, the most interesting one was a <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="492">In order to picture how the <span class="dlf">double wall</span> functioned, you have to you have to picture a very primitive <span class="building">farmstead</span>, and the <span class="building">farmsteads</span> in in <span class="country">Holland</span> uh from an earlier era like this one dated from, had the animals and the people under one <span class="dlf">roof</span>. </sentence><sentence id="493">The people would live up front, and the animals would be in the back. </sentence><sentence id="494">Very convenient if you go milking cause you just open up a <span class="dlf">door</span> and you're in the <span class="building">stable</span> and you can milk the cows and bring the milk right into the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="495">In fact that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="496">Well, in this <span class="dlf">wall</span>, they had they had two <span class="dlf">walls</span> then one separating the <span class="building">house</span> from the main part of the <span class="building">stable</span> and then another separation between the cows and the horses. </sentence><sentence id="497">And that's where they built the <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="498">And he had a friend, a uh a bricklayer come in, and duplicate the the <span class="dlf">wall</span> that was already there exactly as it was uh oh about maybe uh a couple of feet away, and uh then to get to that place they would hoist us up to the <span class="dlf">rafters</span> and let us down with a rope so that we'd between the two <span class="dlf">walls</span> and of course there was no <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="499">Uh these raids always came at the worst times. </sentence><sentence id="500">I remember one time my mother, my mother had a severe case of diarrhea when the alarms came and they hoisted her in there with uh with uh a <span class="spatial object">potty</span> and uh can you imagine those poor people that had to sit there for I think twenty-four hours with someone who had an over-flowing <span class="spatial object">potty</span> of diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="501">Ugh. </sentence><sentence id="502">Fortunately they hid me someplace else that time. </sentence><sentence id="503">They hid me in a <span class="spatial object">haystack</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: Tell me a little bit about your daily routine when you were living with the farm family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Well, I think I think everybody was quite aware that in order to go, to keep from going stircrazy, you have to keep people busy. </sentence><sentence id="561">And uh the Janssens increasingly gave us work to do. </sentence><sentence id="562">We peeled all their potatoes, and when I say all, potatoes was a staple and uh the Janssens were sheltering not only Jews but at various times various members of their rather extensive family that had moved to the <span class="populated place">city</span> and were running out of food. </sentence><sentence id="563">So there was uh one other <span class="building">chicken house</span> full of people. </sentence><sentence id="564">Uh Harry used to say how fortunate that the Nazis stole all our chickens. </sentence><sentence id="565">This way we can house the people. </sentence><sentence id="566">We can house the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="567">There's another <span class="building">chicken house</span> full and sometimes some of the other <span class="building">buildings</span>. </sentence><sentence id="568">I had relatives in them too. </sentence><sentence id="569">So we strung the beans and peeled the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="570">Something that uh people find hard to believe we strung tobacco and <span class="country">Holland</span> is not known as a tobacco raising country, but uh you know, we were talking a little earlier how starved people were for for these cigarettes or anything resembling cigarettes, so they found some variety that would grow there and people took tremendous risks smuggling uh seeds for tobacco which we then grew secretly and strung secretly. </sentence><sentence id="571">There was a lot of secret stuff. </sentence><sentence id="572">I still remember Harry did another thing which was strictly illegal. </sentence><sentence id="573">He butchered. </sentence><sentence id="574">Uh he butchered hogs. </sentence><sentence id="575">And we, and people who farmedwere supposed to deliver all uh animals that were ready for <span class="building">market</span>, all produce to the Germans, which they then shipped east. </sentence><sentence id="576">They didn't give hardly anything to the people in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, which is why there was such a famine there. </sentence><sentence id="577">But uh Harry in contravention of all the rules, slaughtered, and we did that right on the <span class="interior space">kitchen floor</span>. </sentence><sentence id="578">Uh can imagine a little Jewish boy... (laughter)...a scene like that. </sentence><sentence id="579">I had no real sense of where meat was coming from and to see then slit the throat of a hog and string it up from the <span class="interior space">ceiling</span> and cut it up into pieces and make sausage out of the guts that was some experience. </sentence><sentence id="580">But uh it was something that the kids all watched with glee and uh I made a real effort to to fit in. </sentence><sentence id="581">It was hard because you know I was uh a city slicker from the <span class="region">north</span> and they were country bumpkins from the <span class="region">south</span> and they, they not only had a completely different culture, they had a different language. </sentence><sentence id="582">They spoke Dutch but it was such a different dialect that uh if they talked among themselves I couldn't understand a word they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="583">And I knew I was I was a native Dutchman. </sentence><sentence id="584">However fortunately This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="585">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="586"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they learned standard Dutch in <span class="building">school</span> so if they wanted to they could include me. </sentence><sentence id="587">And of course in short order I learned the dialect and learned to watch such things as hog slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="588">And it was uh kind of a fun thing in a way because the one thing that uh we kids would get out of it immediately was the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="589">And you will say, what do you do with a <span class="spatial object">hog bladder</span>. </sentence><sentence id="590">Well, what you do is you you try to scrape and wash it clean the best you can, and then you take an old <span class="spatial object">tin can</span> and you tie the top of the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span> to the <span class="spatial object">tin can</span> much as you would make a <span class="spatial object">drum</span>, with one difference. </sentence><sentence id="591">You'd also take a stick and you would tie that to the center of the <span class="spatial object">bladder</span>, centered over the <span class="spatial object">drum</span>, centered over the over the <span class="spatial object">tin can</span>, and then you would tie it taught. </sentence><sentence id="592">Then you would spit into your hands, , and then you would slide it up and down the stick and that was an instrument, an instrument which everybody learned to hate. </sentence><sentence id="593">But uh for uh for uh, what what is this holiday called in English sometimes it's it's hard to translate on the spot uh it's it's a spring holiday just befo...just before the frost (ph) uh, help me, it's fat fat Monday in French. </sentence><sentence id="594">Mardi Gras. </sentence><sentence id="595">OK. </sentence><sentence id="596">Uh on Mardi Gras we would go out and uh and serenade the neighbors which with what we called the , and uh as much to get rid the awful noise as anything else, they would they would give little handouts and then the kids would troop other places. </sentence><sentence id="597">Well, of course I couldn't do this during the occupation but I was there a good while after and uh I remember doing that with the kids and of course I had the fun of of making my own - Well, what else did we do? </sentence><sentence id="598">Well the interesting part is that unschooled and unlettered as the Janssen's were, uh especially the older girls got quite interested in all the literary activity of the Ph. </sentence><sentence id="599">D."s that uh were in hiding with them. </sentence><sentence id="600">Now these Ph.D. uh parental generation of mine was was odd from from my retrospective point of view. </sentence><sentence id="601">They were dressed like you and I are

id="605">That went on first. </sentence><sentence id="606">Uh so that showed the kind of activity you asked activity uh it is amazing the p...these two Ph. </sentence><sentence id="607">D."s had their

</sentence><sentence id="615">Tremendous advertising I would think for that <span class="building">firm</span>. </sentence><sentence id="616">Well, in that <span class="region">outback place</span> they had a <span class="spatial object">typewriter</span>. </sentence><sentence id="617">Uh Heinz who had different interests uh decided to do a history on the life of Millieure (ph), the playwright because to the <span class="interior space">underground</span> he he got uh in contact with a group of monks across the <span class="dlf">border</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, in the <span class="region">southeast corner</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, very close to <span class="country">Belgium</span> uh who unbeknownst I guess to to the uh uh regular scholars had hoarded away the personal papers of Millieure which they smuggled to Heinz and which he made a treatise out of. </sentence><sentence id="618">He finally wrote a play on the life of Millieure so that's what went on in that <span class="building">chicken house</span>, as hard as it is to believe. </sentence><sentence id="619">Well, with all this literary activities the kids came by to see and my father started uh teaching them uh how to do poetry and how to make drawings and we made skits. </sentence><sentence id="620">I remember one of the neighbors who knew most neighbors knew uh that Harry was hiding refugees was having a fiftieth wedding anniversary and we made the most elaborate uh skit for them, uh a whole production uh uh weaving together stories from from the families that were going to be at this uh at this at the ceremony, at the celebration. </sentence><sentence id="621">And I still have those today. </sentence><sentence id="622">Very good stuff.

we became very good friends which is from what I hear a rather unusual story because relations between people who were hiding and people who were hiding them were not always the best. </sentence><sentence id="627">You can imagine what tremendous pressure that put on people and uh the Janssens did extremely well not only in successfully hiding the five people in their charge for for uh two years and then taking care of them afterwards, because afterwards we had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="628">We were in the part of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> that

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="732">A: Well, I've mentioned the principle one. </sentence><sentence id="733">Uh we we uh, the first one where we were the least prepared, Harry took us way back into the <span class="env feature">peat bog</span> where he knew of an abandoned <span class="building">barn</span> where we hid in hid in the <span class="interior space">attic</span>. </sentence><sentence id="734">Uh after that as I told you he constructed or had constructed this <span class="dlf">double wall</span>. </sentence><sentence id="735">For a time they they toyed with the idea of building an <span class="building">air raid shelter</span> with uh with a secret <span class="interior space">room</span> in this, but even though the air raid This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="736">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="737"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this <span class="building">collection shelter</span> got partly built that that never came came up. </sentence><sentence id="738">One time they tried digging a <span class="dlf">tunnel</span> under a <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> for me. </sentence><sentence id="739">That was special for me because it couldn't be uh so big that other that other people bigger than a nineyear old that I was at the time would fit in. </sentence><sentence id="740">You couldn't hide in the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> because it became known pretty quick that when they did a raid they always ran uh sabers and bayonets through <span class="spatial object">haystacks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="741">If they came up with blood they knew they caught somebody. </sentence><sentence id="742">So, but under the <span class="spatial object">haystack</span> was the variation that was the worst night I think I ever spent in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="743">That was awful, in the cold clammy dark place under that <span class="spatial object">haystack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="744">Uh I complained very little, but they never did that again because I I did complain and that was really awful. </sentence><sentence id="745">Uh other times when there was little advanced notice we would just hide in the <span class="dlf">ditches</span> and plenty of <span class="dlf">ditches</span> to hide in in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> and uh in a dry, in the drier season that gives you quite a bit of cover and mobility cause if you can get some sense of which way the raid is going you can constantly keep cover and and keep on the move. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: Were the raids frequent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Well, uh I am reconstructing that there must have been four that actually reached the place and maybe three or four others in the <span class="populated place">neighborhood</span> which were just as bad from the standpoint of getting everybody all excited because you never knew are they going to come to your <span class="dlf">farm</span> or not, but uh there was a Nazi sympathizer unfortunately that uh lived across the <span class="dlf">street</span>. </sentence><sentence id="765">Again it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="766">You know, as I told you before, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. </sentence><sentence id="767">Uh my hunch is uh that this fellow like like many people who who played with the Nazis was more interested in being important than being disloyal and uh you know, an occupying force, especially a loud and oppressive one, has a certain amount of attraction to it, and uh there was an element, there's a type of of a personality I think that gets attracted to this and wants to go over to them and and tell them something that they don't already know, and get pat on the back and be told you're a great citizen and great supporter of the new order. </sentence><sentence id="768">Uh and uh it is pretty clear that uh that the that the neighbor across the <span class="dlf">street</span> told on us which is breaking ranks with with all the rest of the people around who who did know. </sentence><sentence id="769">And uh after liberation Harry really confronted this guy according to what uh his wife This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="770">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="771"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Nina (ph) told me later, until he had this guy on his knees in the middle of the <span class="dlf">street</span> begging for mercy. </sentence><sentence id="772">I mean there were that kind of strong feelings about but uh that is how come there were specific raids on our place. </sentence><sentence id="773">I mean there were there were really actual fingers pointed at Harry and that he was able to keep cool under those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="774">One day he payed played cards to, in the first raid as a matter of fact, he carried off by playing cards. </sentence><sentence id="775">He and his friend Marinus (ph) who were who was his closest friend and who was in the <span class="interior space">underground</span> with him, uh had gotten notice that uh that we were going to be raided with very little advanced notice. </sentence><sentence id="776">Took us out to this <span class="building">barn</span> in the <span class="region">outback</span> like I told you, and then he and Marinus uh uh got together some drinks and uh spread the card, cards out you know moments before the raiding party came. </sentence><sentence id="777">They they acted like they had been playing and drinking all night, acting completely surprised. </sentence><sentence id="778">What you guys looking here on a on a strange night like this? </sentence><sentence id="779">Well, we were told to make a search. </sentence><sentence id="780">Search for what? </sentence><sentence id="781">Well, you know, that conversation went on like that till they got them into the game where where these two excellent card players first took all their money. </sentence><sentence id="782">To keep interest in it, they let them win some of it back, which you know ate up a whole lot of time, all the time saying oh there's always time to go looking around the place, till they were so drunk and so tired that uh they hardly did any looking around at all. </sentence><sentence id="783">And Harry kept the best uh the best drinks for occasions like this. </sentence><sentence id="784">So he he played his way through a search which is probably also weird in the annals of uh secret operations. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="810">END OF TAPE </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="811">Q: Mr. Heppner, can you tell me whether there are any stories about Mr. Janssen that particularly stick out in your mind? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: Yeah, well he he did some really nice and and supportive things. </sentence><sentence id="813">Probably the most supportive thing that he did to help us live through which which was a very difficult situation I mean here we were in this <span class="building">chicken house</span>, right, uh This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="814">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="815"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection with for for the most part uh no opportunity to go elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="816">One thing he did is he built a uh <span class="dlf">site barricade</span> next to the <span class="building">chicken house</span> out of out of some of sheathes of grain, kind of a <span class="dlf">palisade</span> and uh so we could walk you know short distance like maybe ten feet back and forth outside or sit in the sun and be shielded from the <span class="dlf">road</span> by that. </sentence><sentence id="817">But one thing that he did that I I think was particularly thoughtful and dangerous was to bring in a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>, a <span class="spatial object">receiver</span>. </sentence><sentence id="818">Now you must understand that nobody in the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was allowed to have a <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="819">There were certain people who with uh certain people that were deemed trustworthy by the Nazis who could get a permit for a special <span class="spatial object">radio</span> which was constructed so that it could only get two <span class="building">stations</span>, which were the two approved <span class="building">stations</span> that they felt people should listen to. </sentence><sentence id="820">So to get a a regular <span class="spatial object">radio</span> that could listen to anything, <span class="spatial object">shortwave radio</span>, was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="821">But he got one anyway. </sentence><sentence id="822">And dangerous because one can trace <span class="spatial object">radios</span> without making <span class="building">house</span> searches. </sentence><sentence id="823">You can trace apparently whether someone is receiving <span class="env feature">air waves</span> uh electronically. </sentence><sentence id="824">So it was uh a very risky thing to do and uh when my father got over the shock of this very special gift that Harry brought him, he he mentioned that and he says well, how many times can they kill us already. </sentence><sentence id="825">So this was the attitude that that he took and uh so my father really made a business of of listening to the news of of the war and for a while we, he even put together a little underground newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="826">His best source of information was in English but his English wasn't really good enough to to follow uh news broadcasts too well, so he found uh a <span class="building">German station</span> that was giving the uh the <span class="dlf">party line</span>, the German version of how things were going in the war, at dictation speed in English, because apparently this was done as as as kind of a propaganda tool to Englishspeaking peoples, to show them how the Nazis were really winning the war, and so my father could listen to the English broadcasts at dictation speed which was done so that people could copy it down and and you know make little newspapers out of it and uh then would listen to the same broadcast at regular speed, and then he would train his ear so that he could understand the terms that would be used in any kind of a of a broadcast. </sentence><sentence id="827">Then he would listen to the news a third time from the <span class="region">Allied side</span>, get the true story and understand it. </sentence><sentence id="828">There was no paper and my dad scribbled on on the back of old envelopes, in the margins of of diaries, of of tear*off uh uh calendars and everything. </sentence><sentence id="829">I still have some of these pieces of paper very very small, hurried writing, where you could see how he was following the news. </sentence><sentence id="830">But for a time they did manage to uh This is a

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to put out a little newspaper till word got back to Harry that uh this was being noticed by the wrong people and we quit. </sentence><sentence id="833">But uh Dad still would uh feed information into to the <span class="interior space">underground</span> on the progress of the war and of course we all followed with with great interest ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="834">And that <span class="spatial object">radio</span> stayed with us throughout. </sentence><sentence id="835">I remember I I did I did some drawing as I told you, that was one of the special subjects that my dad taught me. </sentence><sentence id="836">He he was a pretty good cartoonist and uh one time he said what are you drawing, and he said, and I said well I'm just drawing this <span class="dlf">wall</span> of of things in the <span class="building">chicken house</span>. </sentence><sentence id="837">He says but you're not going to put in the <span class="spatial object">radio</span>. </sentence><sentence id="838">I said well yeah I guess not. </sentence><sentence id="839">So here I have this drawing where you can see the <span class="dlf">ground wire</span> of the <span class="spatial object">radio</span> which I had already drawn, and instead see see a <span class="spatial object">clock</span> on the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="916">A: Well, I think that the underground movement in the <span class="region">area</span> where we where we were at was the most enthusiastic about rescuing pilots. </sentence><sentence id="917">Uh pilots were regularly being shot out of the <span class="env feature">air</span> because a good part of the war was was carried out on in the <span class="dlf">air</span>. </sentence><sentence id="918">Uh the decisive battles really were in the <span class="dlf">air</span>, not on the <span class="env feature">ground</span> and uh so one time generally these two various underground operations were kept separate for obvious reasons one time a pilot stayed with us overnight. </sentence><sentence id="919">And this was very exciting and of course the pilot was very pleased because he hadn't really been able to talk to anybody because all he knew was English. </sentence><sentence id="920">And to find someone in the <span class="region">outback</span> that spoke English was to him a real find and you know, my father and he, they talked all night about you know about his background and his fears and he finally could get clued in as to what was happening to him, cause he really didn't know who had taken possession of him and what they could do for him, so I remember my father and and this man, an Englishman, talking all night till the next morning when they came to get him, and they got him out successfully. </sentence><sentence id="921">They, that was a pretty successful operation they smuggled them south into <span class="country">France</span> and then into <span class="country">Spain</span> and <span class="country">Portugal</span> and it was a regular route for to ship downed pilots back that way. </sentence><sentence id="922">And never or they did use if for Jews but not with equal enthusiasm. </sentence><sentence id="923">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="924">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="925"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="946">A: Well, I can tell you something that ties right in to the day of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="947">One of the side elements of the air war was an effort by the Allies to disturb the German communications, and for a time they would drop lots of uh little strips of black paper with aluminum foil attached to them, which I guess uh disrupts radar and what happened I guess uh fly through a <span class="dlf">radar net</span> that otherwise might detect <span class="spatial object">planes</span> that were coming through, so we kids made a game of this. </sentence><sentence id="948">And we would go out in the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and hunt all those strips of paper and use them for art projects. </sentence><sentence id="949">I still have a <span class="spatial object">calendar</span> for example that that where I made the backing out of out of those little bits of paper which we called silver paper. </sentence><sentence id="950">And the <span class="region">area</span> in which we were, atypical for the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, was solidly Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="951">In fact that's probably why the people were successful in in hiding Jews because of the solidarity among Catho...in a <span class="populated place">Catholic enclave</span> in the midst of of a <span class="country">protestant country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="952">And uh so we would go through the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and <span class="env feature">meadows</span> singing "Holy St.Anthony, dear friend, I hope that you will help me find a little slip of paper," in Dutch it rhymes.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: Bad and and getting worse. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Because the food situation really was bad and the strain and stress was really telling on the people. </sentence><sentence id="1149">I mean I'm reconstructing this afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Uh in the spring of "45 I was really sick and uh that was the time that the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was just starting to be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1151">It wasn't near as dramatic as our liberation because uh the Nazis just faded away at a certain point because their <span class="dlf">supply lines</span> to the east uh had been broken and militarily the <span class="region">northern part</span> of the <span class="country">Netherlands</span> was never forcefully taken. </sentence><sentence id="1152">But the famine there was worse than it was in the <span class="region">south</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It was bad enough with us but at least we had we had scraps of food. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Uh in the <span class="region">north</span> they had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So my father got together as big a package of food as he thought he could manage and uh started to make his way <span class="region">north</span> because he knew his friends in in <span class="populated place">Amsterdam</span> were starving. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And uh the time that he said goodbye and going back to <span class="populated

id="1158">Well I got sick at the same time and uh I was put in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and uh never heard that my dad had died. </sentence><sentence id="1159">They didn't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="1160">They were still shielding me. </sentence><sentence id="1161">For months they didn't tell me that he had died and they kept making up stories as to where he might be and I guess that's why I have a tough time believing people even today because people just weren't straight with me. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Well, they figured he's a poor sick kid why bother him with the story that his father died and then finally they were caught in their own stories, so you know then no one made up makeup stories and I just had to find out on my own that my dad was dead, which was a very hard thing for me to live down and of course it was hard on my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1163">No need to compare who it was harder for, but she depended a lot on him.

didn't know about it that at the time either. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I I heard that afterwards too. </sentence><sentence id="1174">So really out of the six people that that started out on the run together in August of "42, uh out of the six people only three survived. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And none of the losses was due to Harry. </sentence><sentence id="1176">My dad died after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Mrs.Graumann of course a few months later, and Michael before we got to Harry. </sentence><sentence id="1178">So Harry has a perfect record.

dozen people on his <span class="dlf">doorstep</span> because uh as I was saying several of Harry's relatives had had been not really hiding but living with us uh more or less openly uh to escape the

into it the best he could and uh continued with his usual pursuits. </sentence><sentence id="1241">He always had a little <span class="spatial object">notebook</span> of some kind and I still can picture him sitting there and on some straw that we had put on the <span class="env feature">ground</span>, making notes to himself and I uh dragged in one of my best finds uh a soldier who had gotten so excited at finding aa little urchin that spoke English and turned out to be a Jewish urchin, that he had come, had to absolutely come and see the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence

everything he had and there were no limits. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Uh anything that you mentioned he'd do. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Although the one thing that we were the most scared to ask, because we had been told repeatedly not to ask, which is to use their communications network. </sentence><sentence id="1251">And as I told you the <span class="region">countryside</span> was in a

me right now I could understand them fairly well. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I could ask questions if I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1469">In the <span class="building">class</span> I couldn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="1470">In fact frequently the only thing I understood all day long was the questions they asked me on the materials that they had just covered. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Questions directed personally at me I could understand easier than lectures. </sentence><sentence id="1472">I just couldn't understand, and it was I was totally frustrated and the adults were totally preoccupied making a living and I was the only little kid because as I said my uncle had his son living with him but he was a grown son. </sentence><sentence id="1473">He had just come back from the war. </sentence><sentence id="1474">He had his own problems. </sentence><sentence id="1475">He had he had uh fought with the American Armies and was just trying to re-stabilize his life, so he didn't have time with me so here I was again, thrown completely on my own resources without anybody to talk to or anybody to help me over this very difficult

anything to do with uh with refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And uh the only way in which I made contact was through a <span class="building">drama club</span> and since all of us were acting then and since I was acting all the time anyway I could fit in there. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And that's how I got to know some kids my own age and and started making friends, so the <span

<span class="building">drama club</span>, and thespian is a good word to use because the honor society in that <span class="populated place">community</span> was called the Thespian Society, and the day that they made me a Thespian I knew that I had arrived in some <span class="region">area</span> that I really wanted to be in. </sentence><sentence id="1482">After that uh I kind of drifted into <span class="building">college</span> and then drifted into <span class="country">Israel</span>, thinking that maybe that's where I'd like to be, but I didn't feel comfortable there either and besides the <span class="country">U.S.</span> government was sending me threatening letters that if I didn't come back they would call me a draft dodger because at that time everybody had to go into the into
