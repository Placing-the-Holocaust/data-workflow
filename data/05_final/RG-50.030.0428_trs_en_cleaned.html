<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: ... get you to state your name and where you were born F </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Okay, Mel London, I was born in <span class="populated place">New York</span>, I was born in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>, as we used to say, in <span class="dlf">Charlotte Street</span>, which is the famous <span class="region">area</span> that Ronald Reagan stood in and said he was going to bring back and never did. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in 1923. </sentence><sentence id="5">At this point in 1996, I'll be 73 in August. </sentence><sentence id="6">My father, excuse me, my father and mother were both immigrants, my father was born in <span class="country">Russia</span>, actually in <span class="country">Lithuania</span> and came over to the <span class="country">United States</span> when he was 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="7">He supported the family, they lived on <span class="dlf">Rivington(ph) Street</span> in the <span class="region">lower east side</span>, he supported the family by being a professional boxer, something I never knew about until I was older and boxed at <span class="building">college</span> and my father taught me everything I knew and he never bothered to tell me that he had been a professional boxer until I read about it in a column one time and found out that he was pretty good, which is why he always was better than I when he taught me to box. </sentence><sentence id="8">He then went into the dress business and for the rest of his life, until he was 83 and then retired and had to, because of health, he was in the dress business. </sentence><sentence id="9">My mother was born in <span class="country">England</span> and came over as an infant. </sentence><sentence id="10">So they really came from a, an immigrant, both came from immigrant families. </sentence><sentence id="11">My father's background though, was something that we were never able to really trace back, we don't know why we have the name <span class="populated place">London</span>, which of course was a taken name, in that coming from <span class="country">Lithuania</span> there was another name, but his mother, being far ahead of her time, ran away from her husband and ran away with a lover. </sentence><sentence id="12">Now, for this happening at the beginning of the century, you realize is quite a rare occurrence and so the name was picked up somewhere and nobody ever knew where. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was brought up in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>, I went to <span class="building">school</span> in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>, I went to <span class="building">city college</span> and was interrupted by a war. </sentence><sentence id="14">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="15">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="16"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection enlisted in the army in September of 1942 and was discharged in the summer, I think it was in August of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I spent four years in the army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: If you can, talk a little bit about before the war actually interrupted your studies, what were you hearing about what was going on in <span class="country">Europe</span> and how was it a part of your consciousness? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Well I can actually remember the day that war was declared in September of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="38">We were still in the <span class="country">country</span>, the family was just able, my father was just able to send the family away to the <span class="country">country</span> so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the <span class="populated place">city</span> and I can actually remember the, the war starting. </sentence><sentence id="39">At that time I was 16 years old, so that there was a consciousness of a teenager. </sentence><sentence id="40">As with most of the people here at that time, as I recall it, it was a distant thing, we knew the war was going on, I mean, you, we heard about the bombings, we knew the war was going on, we knew that the refugees were coming here or starting to come here, but very frankly knew very little about the nuances of it, we knew very little about the <span class="spatial object">ships</span> that were turned away, the one that went to <span class="populated place">Havana</span> and was turned away. </sentence><sentence id="41">This came later. </sentence><sentence id="42">If I speak of it now, it's because of something that I'd read about, but at the time it was a war that was in Europe, you know, the war's in Europe again and I guess, particularly at 16 and being involved in track and girls and things like that, I really thought very little about the war. </sentence><sentence id="43">We followed it, you couldn't help but follow it, it was in the headlines all the time. </sentence><sentence id="44">So we knew about the <span class="dlf">Magino(ph) line</span>, we knew about the problems of the bombings of <span class="country">England</span> and so on and until <span class="country">America</span> entered the war, for us it was happening in another place. </sentence><sentence id="45">We were not, at the time, as knowledgeable as we are now about what was happening in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> and with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="46">We knew of course, about Kristallnacht, we knew about Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="47">In fact I remember as a child, listening to Hitler, I remember that they broadcast here, in the <span class="country">United States</span>, they broadcast some of the speeches and I remember, whether it was from <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> or some other place, the absolute electricity of this man when he spoke and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="48">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="49"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I must say I hear the patterns with some of the people we have around the <span class="country">United States</span> now, you can actually hear the patterns, you can hear if you've studied the patterns and the things they were said, without getting into the politics of the <span class="country">United States</span>, you could begin to hear how he enthralled the people. </sentence><sentence id="50">Later on I was to see <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, later on I was to see the <span class="building">stadium</span>, later on I was to see the films of all of these, these rallies, but we actually remember them and I can remember to this day, sitting in the little <span class="interior space">foyer</span> that we had in an <span class="interior space">apartment</span> in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> and listening to this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Any other memories about that, perhaps that your father might have had or your mother? </sentence><sentence id="68">Your father might have still had family in <span class="country">Russia</span> or any concern there might have been in the family for Jews in general or specific people that you knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Well I think, without being religious Jews, we all, always did have and still do have a feeling of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="72">My father did not have family there. </sentence><sentence id="73">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="74">So that we have always felt a very deep feeling of Judaism without being religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="75">My father did speak of other pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was brought up in <span class="region">area</span> where the Cossacks were very, very active and her remembers the raids in the little <span class="populated place">town</span> of Puniaman(ph). </sentence><sentence id="77">I found out much later in life that I was one thirty-second Cossack, which was something that destroyed my brother when he heard it. </sentence><sentence id="78">We don't know where the great, great, great, great grandfather was the rapist or whatever it may have been, but we were one thirty- second Cossack. </sentence><sentence id="79">In terms of <span class="country">Europe</span>, from 1933 say, until the war began and I was much more involved certainly, in listening, we really had very, as I recall, very little discussion about it. </sentence><sentence id="80">And that may have been very normal in the family, I just don't remember very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: You enlisted, why did you, what were your reasons? </sentence><sentence id="92">Do you remember speaking to your family about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="96">I, as a matter of fact I enlisted because, there was a war, they were beginning to draft people, my father had spent, I guess a year and a half or so in World War | as an infantryman. </sentence><sentence id="97">He This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="98">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="99"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was wounded three times. </sentence><sentence id="100">The third time he was wounded they wanted to take his leg off because of gangrene. </sentence><sentence id="101">And that's an interesting story in that he then refused to sign the paper. </sentence><sentence id="102">And he wouldn't sign the paper and the gangrene receded. </sentence><sentence id="103">He said, "I came into this <span class="env feature">world</span> with two legs, I'm going out with two legs." </sentence><sentence id="104">The gangrene receded. </sentence><sentence id="105">My father, from 1918, never went to a doctor, until he was 83 years old and hurt himself working in the dress business, a bolt of cloth had fallen on his wrist and I made him go to the doctor and the doctor said, "Well Mr. <span class="populated place">London</span>, when was the last time you visited a doctor?" </sentence><sentence id="106">He said,"1918." </sentence><sentence id="107">And the doctor said, "Well, you're none the worse for it." </sentence><sentence id="108">My father said to me, "Don't ever get in the infantry. </sentence><sentence id="109">Do anything to get out of the infantry." </sentence><sentence id="110">And he had gone through three wounds and the <span class="dlf">trenches</span> and of course, as every soldier he only told funny stories about how his mother sent potato pancakes overseas, you know and they arrived like <span class="env feature">rocks</span>, but he never told about the terror and the horror of it, but he did communicate to me that it was pretty awful. </sentence><sentence id="111">And so I enlisted in, I actually enlisted in the <span class="building">enlisted reserve</span> in May of "43 and was in the <span class="building">signal corps</span>, I enlisted in the <span class="building">signal corps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="112">And that probably, that and also getting pneumonia when my <span class="spatial object">unit</span> went overseas to go to D-Day, saved my life, I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> with pneumonia, so. </sentence><sentence id="113">But that was the basic reason I enlisted was I knew I would be drafted, but I thought I might just as well enlist and get some kind of a background and that signal corps background in fact, was the thing that created a career for me later on. </sentence><sentence id="114">So I enlisted and I went to, into the army where several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="115">One, to make me understand more about anti-Semitism, because in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> particularly and I left the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> at 17 and pretty much at 19 I enlisted. </sentence><sentence id="116">In the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> you got very little of it, the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span> was very heavily Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="117">I was now coming into the United States army, a democracy of sorts, or fighting for a democracy, where I began to come into anti-Semitism in both it's subtle and it's overt forms. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were going to get it. </sentence><sentence id="119">I mean the anti-Semitic jokes that suddenly started to be told around me while This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="120">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="121"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection someone turned and says, "Well, I don't mean you, I don't consider you Jewish," when after all, I am Jewish, is one thing. </sentence><sentence id="122">The second thing was that I, after two years, went to <span class="building">OCS</span>. </sentence><sentence id="123">I had gone all the way from... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: What's OCS? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: <span class="building">Officer Candidate School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="158">I had gone from private to PFC and then they busted me back to private because they didn't have enough <span class="interior space">room</span> for a <span class="spatial object">PFC</span> you see and I decided I was going nowhere after two years. </sentence><sentence id="159">Luckily I was teaching in <span class="building">school</span>, I was teaching at officer, at <span class="building">officer school</span> as a private and a PFC, I was teaching colonels and generals and like an idiot I kept volunteering to go overseas with them. </sentence><sentence id="160">I wanted to go to <span class="region">New Guinea</span>, I wanted to go to Europe and nobody would let me go, I was one of eight people who had a top secret clearance with the United States army, teaching this course, so nobody would let me go. </sentence><sentence id="161">I finally decided the only way to get out of this would be to go into <span class="building">Officer Candidate School</span>. </sentence><sentence id="162">So I applied for <span class="building">Officer Candidate School</span> and again , in speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army, I was in a company, I was first sergeant in a company of 250 officer candidates. </sentence><sentence id="163">There were 13 Jews and two blacks and I, as first sergeant, was allowed to pick my roommate. </sentence><sentence id="164">You see, the <span class="building">barracks</span> were made up and if you've seen <span class="building">barracks</span>, they were made up of 60 <span class="spatial object">beds</span>, <span class="spatial object">double decker</span> and one <span class="interior space">squad room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="165">The <span class="interior space">squad room</span> was where there were two <span class="spatial object">beds</span> and the first sergeant and one other non-commissioned officer would be in the <span class="interior space">squad room</span>, so you had a <span class="interior space">private room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="166">And so I had to become very friendly with a man from <span class="populated place">Washington D. C.</span> named Bob MacNeil(ph), who happened to be one of the two blacks and having been brought up on the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>, I mean I was on a track team with all kinds of people, it made no difference to me and he was the only guy who seemed to understand <span class="populated place">inner city</span> thinking and was getting the same kind of battering from the others that I was getting, so in front of a company of 250 men, the man was Lieutenant Coyne(ph), Lieutenant Coyne(ph) said, "Mr. <span class="populated place">London</span>," I said, "Yes, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="167">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="168"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection sir." </sentence><sentence id="169">He said, "As first sergeant you can choose anyone you like to spend the next three months in the <span class="interior space">squad room</span> with you" and I said, "Mr. MacNeil(ph) sir," so in front of 250 men, I picked one of the two blacks, in 1943 or "44. </sentence><sentence id="170">This was pretty much unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="171">Two things happened, several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="172">Number one, the day before graduation, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out of <span class="building">school</span>, I always say, quite by accident, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out and one of the two blacks. </sentence><sentence id="173">The only two people left of that entire group starting, were Bob MacNeil(ph) and me. </sentence><sentence id="174">At the dance, at the graduation dance, Cheryl, who is my wife of 50 years now, as you know and I knew then, I met her when she was 17 and was still in <span class="building">college</span>, came to Fort Monmouth(ph) to attend the dance and Bob had a friend, a woman named Lua(ph), attend the dance and they had dance cards in those days, you actually had a dance card so that you signed up for the dance and I signed up for a dance with Lua(ph) and she was black also and I, I went on the <span class="interior space">dance floor</span> with her when our turn came and that was fine and then came the time for Bob to dance with Cheryl and as she got on the <span class="interior space">floor</span> with him, the <span class="interior space">floor</span> emptied and all the colonels sitting up on the <span class="interior space">balcony</span> looked like they were getting nauseous and they were leaning over and Bob said, "Do you want to stop dancing?" </sentence><sentence id="175">You got to remember, this is in the 40's and she said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="176">And they danced. </sentence><sentence id="177">Nothing ever happened, I was then assigned and then came an interesting thing. </sentence><sentence id="178">For two years in the army, I was assigned to black troops. </sentence><sentence id="179">I went down to the <span class="region">south</span> and I trained with black troops, I went overseas with 4000 black troops. </sentence><sentence id="180">I went to a black <span class="building">replacement depot</span>. </sentence><sentence id="181">I was then shipped to a replacement company, picking up <span class="dlf">wire</span> behind Mauclauck's(ph) third army, the 258 signal light construction company, which is a black company. </sentence><sentence id="182">I said to a black friend of mine, "I have a feeling that after that incident at, in <span class="building">OCS</span>, they put N on my service record for Negro." </sentence><sentence id="183">She said, "Maybe they put nigger lover on your service record, <span class="region">NL</span>." </sentence><sentence id="184">And that was, but it turned out to be one of the great, great army experiences. </sentence><sentence id="185">I mean, if you had to have a great army experience, this was it. </sentence><sentence id="186">So This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="187">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="188"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection all of this comes as a background of meeting <span class="region">middle America</span> in all of this and being much more aware of how our own people felt about Jews, about blacks. </sentence><sentence id="189">I mean, being so isolated in the <span class="populated place">Bronx</span>, I guess I, it was another opening experience. </sentence><sentence id="190">Now, then when I went to <span class="country">Europe</span> and I was there about the time of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, I did not see combat by the way, I was very lucky on that, for four years in the army, never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having been in the signal corps and taking, oh there was one funny thing by the way, which may or may not have anything to do with this but when I graduated from <span class="building">Officer Candidate School</span> as a second lieutenant, I was sent back to the <span class="building">school</span> again as a student, where I had written the examinations and I had taught for several years, which is a typical army thing. </sentence><sentence id="191">I was now a lieutenant taking a course with examinations I had written. </sentence><sentence id="192">I did very well. </sentence><sentence id="193">In fact on one I think I got one question wrong once because I, I sloughed. </sentence><sentence id="194">When I went to Europe with the occupation forces then, I went through <span class="country">Belgium</span> and then on 40 and eight <span class="spatial object">trains</span> out to, to Graffenau(ph) in <span class="region">Bavaria</span>, with the 258 signal light construction company. </sentence><sentence id="195">I began to become much more aware of several things, number one, of course by that time I was aware of what the Germans had been doing, I did see <span class="populated place">Dachau</span> after the fact, I knew all of this existed. </sentence><sentence id="196">I never met a Nazi except once, though I was firmly convinced that everybody had been. </sentence><sentence id="197">Nobody admitted it, which I think will come to pass when we talk about Albert Speer. </sentence><sentence id="198">The one person who admitted that he had been a Nazi and a member of the Nazi party I hired as my driver in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="199">He was the only honest man I could find and therein hangs a tale when you talk about what happened at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, what happened to the people who claimed they never knew what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="200">I went back to the <span class="country">United States</span> in 1946 for what we laughingly call rest and recuperation because I got married and Cheryl and I spent 60 days here on honeymoon, went to <span class="populated place">Washington</span> to try to get her over and then she came over as the first of what she laughingly calls the dependents. </sentence><sentence id="201">She then spent two years on This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="202">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="203"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Europe with me in <span class="populated place">Salzburg</span>, where I was station manager of a <span class="building">radio station</span>, KOFA on the American Forces Network and then went to <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> with her as Program Manager of <span class="building">American Forces Network</span>, <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="204">And we spent the two years, we were there during the airlift and the Russian blockade. </sentence><sentence id="205">Things, as always happened, it's, when you're in a situation, it seems to be a lot less important or a lot less threatening than it is to people who are reading about it in the <span class="building">Washington Post</span> or the New York Times. </sentence><sentence id="206">And though we were blockaded and we did have an airlift when the Russians turned the power off at 11 o'clock at night, we lit candles, it was that simple. </sentence><sentence id="207">We flew out in 1948 on <span class="spatial object">C47 planes</span>, with our German Shepherd on our laps, you see and then came back to the <span class="country">States</span>. </sentence><sentence id="208">So this was the story, essentially condensed, about these years. </sentence><sentence id="209">Do you have any other questions on this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Mm-hm, if you want to talk a little bit about becoming aware of <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, you were in <span class="country">Europe</span>, particularly what did people say about it, what were your thoughts about it and anything about Albert Speer because after all, you eventually did interview him and we'll get to that, but in terms of having a background. </sentence></p></dialogue>

know, remembering the time, remembering what we had just been through, it was a part of, a part, death was a part of life and remembering or, I remember there was another thing and you'll be talking to people who were dealing with refugees, <span class="country">Europe</span> was in turmoil, this was not the way it is now, you did not get on <span class="spatial object">trains</span>, the <span

were crowding onto <span class="spatial object">planes</span>, I saw, I saw, this is something that just came back to me, I remember GI MP's shooting into the <span class="dlf">air</span> to keep people from getting onto the <span class="spatial object">GI car</span> because the other <span class="spatial object">cars</span> were so crowded where people were going from <span class="populated

guard of GI's who were standing at the side, as I recall there may have been 10 or 12 in two rows and they were the witnesses to it and the, the sentence was read out in both German and English, it must have been in English too, because I remember what they were and there would be, a typical one would be somebody who had taken two GI's prisoners and had, had killed them, had shot them and was found guilty by a <span class="building">court</span> and was hanged. </sentence><sentence id="336">Then the hoods were put over their heads, there were usually two at a time, both <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: Well I probably, I probably laughed when I said no, I mean it was a very strange kind of a request. </sentence><sentence id="463">I seldom on a job have said no. </sentence><sentence id="464">I have said no on films where my ethics were involved. </sentence><sentence id="465">Without saying what side I'm on, but on some of the great issues of the world, such as abortion, the Vietnam War and so on, I had refused films. </sentence><sentence id="466">I refused this on an emotional basis, that I really, number one, did not want to promote his book. </sentence><sentence id="467">Number two, there's the gut feeling that I'm uncomfortable in <span class="country">Germany</span> and that's basically it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="468">I guess though, that the, the whole idea of, as she said, meeting someone who was Hitler's number two man, overwhelmed everything else and I decided I would go. </sentence><sentence id="469">But basically I think I've always had a feeling that if 1 sold one more copy of that book, I'm sorry I did. </sentence><sentence id="470">On the other hand, I'm all for people writing what they feel and, you know, and we have that now even with the David Irving book, though Saint Martens(ph) should probably never have taken it in the first place, the, the title, the David Irving book is on Goebbels the one on Goebbels, which is a Holocaust revisionist, he's the great Holocaust revisionist. </sentence><sentence id="471">I have no problem with him writing, I can't stand the man, but you see what I'm talking about, no problem with the book coming out, but why am I publicizing the book? </sentence><sentence id="472">At the same time, perhaps I could get some of the answers to which I had always felt I would like some answers and understanding also this was going to be a bright man, this was going to be a man who had really thought about This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="473">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="474"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 what he was going to say and that can come later, we can talk about that, because I have many feelings about that. </sentence><sentence id="475">So I went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: How did you prepare yourself emotionally to meet him in a somewhat open way? </sentence><sentence id="493">And was that your goal or did you say to yourself, well I'm going to have opinions about this man and I just, I'm not going to get rid of them, I'm just going to put them to the side. </sentence><sentence id="494">How did you prepare yourself to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="498">A: That, it's again, talking to yourself and saying you know, what is your attitude going to be and I had done enough interviews to say, okay, for the moment, though I have an emotional context in this one, I am just not going to ever show hostility and by the way, there is later, we'll talk about his reaction to me and my reaction to him, after ten days, because he was very perceptive about how I felt and I was very perceptive about what he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="499">So it was a hands off thing, I mean it was no Albert-buddy, Mel-buddy thing, you have to understand that and that too is a part of our relationship that we can talk about. </sentence><sentence id="500">I arrived in Heidelberg(ph) and my client Alma arrived there, I think that day later or the next day, I don't recall, but the first thing we were to do was to meet Albert Speer at the <span class="building">hotel</span> and we were to go to dinner.

in the case of my client Alma, having her hair done one day, every time we walked into a place, the young people walked out. </sentence><sentence id="516">The word got around <span class="populated

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: I set up the questions basically, with my client, but basically they were, they were based on the book and also on questions that I had had all these years. </sentence><sentence id="579">I mean now, finally, I have a chance to, I have a chance to speak to Hitler's number two man and I'm going to ask him questions, which becomes a difficult thing, because he had spent his 20 years, let's go back to <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, the man at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> and if I may, the question I had, if I go back, if I can just digress for a minute is why was Goring sentenced to death, okay? </sentence><sentence id="580">Well, he was a very well known man and VonShurak(ph) and all the people there, why were they sentenced to death and why did two or three of them get away with 20 years on <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>? </sentence><sentence id="581">My feeling then, as my feeling now, even after meeting him, is that he should have been hanged too. </sentence><sentence id="582">But a very interesting thing came up, I asked him a question that I think was the key and Gidda Serany(ph) in her book Albert Speer; His Battle with Truth, brings it up, I think it's on page 167 and I would like to read to it to a moment. " </sentence><sentence id="583"><span class="building">The New York Times</span>, when he died, printed an obituary and an editorial, both of which said Albert Speer was the only man in <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to say he was guilty. </sentence><sentence id="584">Sitting on a <span class="dlf">lawn</span> in Heidelberg(ph) I asked them the question which started, you were the only man at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to say you were guilty. </sentence><sentence id="585">He stopped me at that point and said, I didn't say I was guilty, I said I was responsible." </sentence><sentence id="586">And for all the years I have been going over the nuances between guilt and responsibility and obviously there is a big difference and in Gidda Serany's(ph) book, she tries to, in a sense, come up with the answer as to why Speer did not get sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="587">In <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> the most amazing thing happened and it was a documentary the other night that covered it. </sentence><sentence id="588">Every single one talked about how he did not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="589">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="590"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 know this had happened. </sentence><sentence id="591">Every single one said, well, no, yes he was doing his job, but all this was happening beside him. </sentence><sentence id="592">Speer was the only man who admitted he knew something about it. " </sentence><sentence id="593">Speer was not," she says, "Speer was not, as is sometimes claimed, the only one of the accused at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> to feel and admit to guilt," by the way, she uses the word guilt and I questioned her on that, "but his admission, even though much too generalized, was remarkable, because he was the only one, who by making it, risked fatally influencing the <span class="building">court</span>'s sentence, which for the others who accepted guilt, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg, Olendoff(ph) was inevitable." </sentence><sentence id="594">He was the only one who said he knew any of this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="595">He knew that slave labor was being used and in a sense, he was the only one then who stood apart from all of the others, because if you hear their excuses, I mean this is absolute insanity that these people claimed that nothing went on, when a man who was in charge of the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> didn't know what was going on in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, so that, whatever the reasons, he was always quick to say that he had not admitted guilt, but responsibility and I wrote a letter to the New York Times as you know, which covered that and it's always been a very key point in my feelings about Albert Speer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="616">Q: How did you come to understand how he differentiated between the two? </sentence><sentence id="617">Why did he stop you when you asked that question, say, "No, I didn't say guilt.". </sentence><sentence id="618">I mean, what was the difference to him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="622">A: The difference to him was that if he had said he was guilty, even at that point, even after the fact, then he was as guilty of doing it, or having a guilt for having done it as all of the others. </sentence><sentence id="623">By saying responsible, he was one of the people who had it happen. </sentence><sentence id="624">And I think there's just that thin <span class="dlf">level</span>. </sentence><sentence id="625">In other words, I see it as very much the same, if you want to know the truth, but it was this very thin level that I think he felt, in his own mind. </sentence><sentence id="626">The problems that I had with Albert Speer and I must give Gidda Serany(ph) for her book is that she spent four years with him, I spent 10 days. </sentence><sentence id="627">When I left, and we'll go back to the other things later, but when I left, he asked my client how she thought </sentence></p><p><sentence id="628"> This is a verbatim

some interesting experiences, one afternoon he said, "I would like to show you some of my home movies" and I said, "Oh, how marvelous Herr Speer, let's go in and look at some home movies." </sentence><sentence id="658">And so we went into his <span class="interior space">living room</span>, it was a rather nice <span class="building">house</span> by the way, the <span class="building">house</span> was on a <span class="dlf">hill</span> in Heidelberg(ph), it was a <span class="building">family home</span> and they'd had for I guess many years. </sentence><sentence id="659">The only problem with it was when there was a storm over <span class="populated place">Frankfurt</span> the <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> used to come over and circle and you couldn't record. </sentence><sentence id="660">But aside from that we sat on the <span class="dlf">lawn</span> with the birds chirping and we went inside and we went to look at the home movies.

to the <span class="region">Russian front</span>. </sentence><sentence id="663">Later he said, "Would you like to see some of Adolf Hitler's drawings?" </sentence><sentence id="664">And this was toward the end of the visit, we went to <span class="interior space">inside</span> and again he took out all these drawings. </sentence><sentence id="665">Hitler was a terrible artist by the way,

much as I thought I could get, but there was one that we did where he was really in his element. </sentence><sentence id="676">I asked him, as Gidda Serany(ph) asked him, as many reporters asked him, how he could work with this monster, I mean how could you be a member of Hitler's group and work your way up and he came up with a very interesting answer and I guess in all fairness, you have to accept it. </sentence><sentence id="677">He said, "How would you feel if you were a 29 year old architect and the head of state had asked you to be his architect?" </sentence><sentence id="678">He said, "You're very proud of the head of state," he said, "remember, this is..." And this is all before the war really got under way, this was all in the early days and as a 29 year old, if you look at the people who follow the presidents, who follow the <span class="building">congresspeople</span>, look at all your young people, some of them are really very arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="679">I've seen people come in to an <span class="building">airport</span> and say, "Yeah I want a <span class="spatial object">car</span> because I'm with Jimmy Carter's entourage." </sentence><sentence id="680">And they're 22 years old going on eight, you know and you can understand at 29 this man was suddenly recognized by the head of state. </sentence><sentence id="681">So we went to the drawings that he had done and we did a film on architecture in a <span class="populated place">totalitarian society</span> and I think the thing that amazed me is if I was startled by Hitler's drawings, which were so bad, I was even more startled by the scale of everything that goes on in a <span class="populated place">totalitarian society</span>. </sentence><sentence id="682">Going back to the demonstrations at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span> in the 30's, with the torchlights, and I did see that, that <span class="building">stadium</span>, it's an incredible <span class="building">stadium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="683">Going back to the <span class="building">stadium</span> at <span class="populated place">Nuremberg</span>, going back to everything they ever built, which was always larger than the person, everything that Speer designed, which was going to be in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span>, right after <span class="country">Germany</span> won the war was on a scale that belies imagination. </sentence><sentence id="684">For example, a <span class="interior space">dome</span> which would be on the Unterdinlinden(ph) and would hold 100,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="685">Just a <span class="interior space">dome</span>. </sentence><sentence id="686">And then the Unterdinlinden(ph) would now be made into a <span class="dlf">military avenue</span> of about 48 lanes wide, with <span class="spatial object">cannon</span> on each side. </sentence><sentence id="687">Everything he showed me was totalitarian, was fascist. </sentence><sentence id="688">It's what Mussolini did, it's what Hitler would do and this man involved himself in things that were beyond This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="689">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="690"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 imagination in terms of scale. </sentence><sentence id="691">I mean a <span class="building">skyscraper</span>'s a <span class="building">skyscraper</span>, when you talk about a <span class="spatial object">dome</span>, under which 100,000 people can stand comfortably, you're talking about a pretty big <span class="spatial object">dome</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: What was he like when he showed you these drawings, did you sense pride or perhaps a bit of embarrassment, what was he like? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: That's a wonderful question because I think what I did is I think that after the day, I blanked out. </sentence><sentence id="802">I did not do, I could not have spoken to you after the interviews as I'm speaking to you now, 20 some odd years later. </sentence><sentence id="803">It was a job. </sentence><sentence id="804">I hate to say it that way because you know, it was my job, I did it, people use that as an excuse, but it was a job and if I was going to do the job properly, I had to do it as a professional. </sentence><sentence id="805">Otherwise I should not have taken the job. </sentence><sentence id="806">And so how did I feel through the day? </sentence><sentence id="807">I was interested, I was interested in what he had to say, the relationship was comfortable at that time. </sentence><sentence id="808">At the end of the day I have, we went around Heidelberg(ph), we went to dinners, we really never discussed it or if we discussed it I can't remember having discussed it in any depth now. </sentence><sentence id="809">But all of the, the days were very comfortable days, the weather turned out to be great, it was June as I recall, the weather turned out to be great. </sentence><sentence id="810">He was always very, very charming and I thought more about what questions I'd ask the next day but never did I ever feel like Gidda Serany(ph) did in four years in being able to break through some of this. </sentence><sentence id="811">The man could not be broken through. </sentence><sentence id="812">And whether he then eventually said or felt he was guilty as she says, he did not at that time. </sentence><sentence id="813">Did I feel when I left there that they should have hanged him? </sentence><sentence id="814">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="815">I feel it to this day. </sentence><sentence id="816">I think he got away with murder. </sentence><sentence id="817">For whatever reasons, he got away with murder. </sentence><sentence id="818">He was using slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="819">His excuses for that of course, if you've heard the tapes are you know, this was a war effort, he had nothing to do with the day to day things in the <span class="building">factories</span>, he had to provide people so they could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="820">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="821"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 provide for the war effort. </sentence><sentence id="822">He was a loyal German, which he should have been. </sentence><sentence id="823">I guess probably even after this, I'll think of things that will come back now that I didn't think of 20 years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="848">Q: Did you have any sense of him having an inner struggle and perhaps say, being afraid of it almost and saying no, I still have to believe that what I did was okay, or did you have a sense of that going on inside of Albert Speer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="850">A: Yeah, I would never know what was going on inside of Albert Speer, he had learned to control that and whether he did or not, I know that in future interviews, like in this latest book, he had learned to back off where he didn't want to answer and even if you pursued it, he would go only so far. </sentence><sentence id="851">Did he have an inner turmoil? </sentence><sentence id="852">I don't know, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="853">I don't know if the man felt that he was sorry he was ever convicted, he was sorry they had ever lost, I have no idea and I would never know this of Albert Speer. </sentence><sentence id="854">He handled himself very well in those interviews. </sentence><sentence id="855">He did what he was supposed to do, I did what I was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="856">If I had to do it all over again, I probably would come up with even more driving questions than I did then because I know a lot more now than I did then and it's very difficult to go into an interview like that as a documentary film maker, having studied everything you can about it and still think that you've covered everything, you can't cover everything. </sentence><sentence id="857">There are the old, I should have, I could have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="866">Q: Why do you think he did the interview, or why did he do, beyond perhaps the obvious reasons, I mean the man didn't have to do interviews, but apparently he did them somewhat frequently. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1256">Q: What's the Jewish term? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1283">Q: I mean it's not a feeling that was given particularly by your family, it really came out of your experience as a young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1285">A: Yeah, I think it comes deeper than experience as a young man, I think it comes from I am convinced that there is an ethnic depth in people. </sentence><sentence id="1286">I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="1287">When I hear Middle Eastern music and this includes Arabic, Israeli, any Middle Eastern music or Russian music, something deep within me comes to life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1293">A: Good. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Good feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I mean I happen to be one who can't understand why the Arabs and the Jews fight. </sentence><sentence id="1296">There is a very deep, <span class="region">Middle Eastern</span>, ethnic level there so that I think, my wife Cheryl has the same feeling, I'm not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Or she'll look at me and all of a sudden I stiffen with pleasure because the music gets to me. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Now that didn't come from my background as a child and it didn't come from what my parents taught me because except for my Bar Mitzvah, I really was not a very good Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1299">But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel. </sentence><sentence id="1300">So there is an instinctive Judaism there, don't ask me to explain it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1309">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I actually haven't asked you anything about this and I think there's probably some things you can say about it. </sentence><sentence id="1311">What sense did you get of Speer's relationship with Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1326">Q: Even though in your tapes you do talk about that point where Albert Speer gets sick and he doesn't see Hitler for awhile and as he explains it, he's pulled out of his <span class="region">sphere of influence</span> and then when he sees him again, something has changed. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So even after that change, you don't think that he fundamentally changed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1330">A: No, I don't think he fundamentally changed. </sentence><sentence id="1331">I think this was the, this was the dynamics and I can't speak too you know, authentically, but I think it's the dynamics of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Remember this whole inner group were always close to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1333">You move out for awhile like in any <span class="building">corporate group</span> and then you move in and you've got to work your way back in again. </sentence><sentence id="1334">I think he always respected Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1335">I don't know how he felt at the end of the war, I don't know how he felt before he died but my feeling was that he was close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1342">Q: He says in the interview that you did with him that he feels embarrassed, I think, he might have even said shame and he is very halting when he says this, at declaring his admiration for somebody who became such a monster. </sentence><sentence id="1343">So what's going on there, he's using the right terms for Hitler, he's calling him a monster, but he's also saying that he really cared deeply about this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: See, this is the point, when anyone interviews a man like Albert Speer. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Is he saying this because this is politically correct? </sentence><sentence id="1348">That was a term that was not around then. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Is this the answer he expects me to have? </sentence><sentence id="1350">I mean suppose he said to me and this is only instinctive about his feeling about Hitler through the time. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Suppose he said to me, "Oh this man was a monster, I hated him at the end, I'm This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1352">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1353"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 glad he was dead." </sentence><sentence id="1354">Do you think I could believe it for one minute? </sentence><sentence id="1355">Not when he was involved with the <span class="spatial object">armaments</span> almost right up until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="1356">Not until he was the heir apparent, the heir apparent to Hitler if Hitler had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="1357">No, I have a feeling that we're back to his coming up with the answers of 20 years in <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1358">That's a feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1359">But then again, I'm a very prejudiced man about that whole thing, so you know, in... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1374">Q: And you were there, you spent 10 days with him, so some of the information that you'd gather about him are feelings and nuances about ways he said things and his body language, that sort of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1376">A: Well the body language was pretty much the same throughout. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Almost rigid, comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Comfortable in his answers. </sentence><sentence id="1379">As I say I think he thought about them through all that time. </sentence><sentence id="1380">But in terms of body language, look, he was, there was always the <span class="dlf">gap</span> between us, let's face it, I mean remember, always the business suits with the ties. </sentence><sentence id="1381">I was doing my job and he was answering the best he had thought about answering through all these years. </sentence><sentence id="1382">I think he had come up with the answers to every one of the questions that I asked him and possibly not what Gidda Serany(ph) did cause she really went in depth, but that any reporter coming there would have asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1383">I found no great revelation in anything I read later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1422">Q: Did Albert Speer ever bring up some of the delicate questions himself in a way to sort of pre- empt you, perhaps bringing up the issue of what he knew about the Jews, what was happening to the Jews and when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1424">A: No, as I recall, now remember this is recalling. </sentence><sentence id="1425">As I recall what, the pattern was pretty well set in that unless there was a question he never really volunteered anything, except to bring me in to see Hitler's drawings and the architectural things and the home movies, these were volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1426">In terms of the answers to the questions, not really. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Now I have not heard the tapes in a while, you'd have to hear that, I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I remember it being a pattern, I had my list and this is pretty much what we went to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1434">Q: With the things he volunteered, just listening to you just say that right now I'm wondering, was he just trying to show you just another slightly different angle so that perhaps it being more three dimensional for you? </sentence><sentence id="1435">What's your thoughts on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1438">A: Well it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Again, I can't remember all the nuances of the time I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1440">He was professional. </sentence><sentence id="1441">It's the best I can say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1455">Q: Was there a moment in the 10 days that Albert Speer caught you off guard, said something that surprised you, perhaps even did something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1457">A: Not in terms, I don't remember anything, I'm sure there must have been some times and I'm sure that some of the questions, but you asked the question, the first thing that came to mind was something that has been made very available at this time and in fact I saw it not too long ago on a, on a documentary about the war, which had nothing to do with Albert Speer or Adolf Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1458">And it had to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1459">The Germans were the first to develop <span class="spatial object">jet planes</span>, or to develop flyable <span class="spatial object">jet planes</span>, which would have totally destroyed the armada's of the allies, considering everything was a <span class="spatial object">prop plane</span> at the time, the <span class="building">flying fortresses</span> and so on and the P38's and Hitler did not trust the <span class="spatial object">jet engine</span>, it had no propeller. </sentence><sentence id="1460">And therefore, up until the very end, he refused to let them use it. </sentence><sentence id="1461">At the very end he let them use it. </sentence><sentence id="1462">By that time though, Speer could not develop enough <span class="spatial object">planes</span> to make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="1463">But there was a fascinating thing, it's like somebody developing the atomic bomb before us, so of all the things that he mentioned to me, that sticks in my mind as something that I had not heard of and now as I say, has become part of the historians, you know, the historians whole group of books and films and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1464">But that to me, surprised me. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Other than that, in terms of the answers, remember I said my feeling was, through the entire time that he had come up, I could not come up with a question except asking what he said to his wife and his children, in the visits to <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>, that he would not have thought of before. </sentence><sentence id="1466">A very bright man, a very bright man. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Under some other form of government would have been a brilliant executive possibly, I can't say architect because I was never very impressed with his architecture as I was not impressed with Hitler's drawings, but was bright enough, was presentable enough, was articulate enough. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Certainly spoke English quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1470">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1471"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 have been a really well known, great man in some other <span class="country">country</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1472">But he never really, we never really threw one another. </sentence><sentence id="1473">He never really threw me, I had my questions, I always had to keep my deep feelings buried, which I did and he in turn had thought of every single one of the answers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1493">Q: Do you think that, do you think that what you were just mentioning, that he's very bright, he could have, he could have just been such a shining star in another <span class="country">country</span>, another government, do you think that might be part of where his sadness comes from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1495">A: Possibly, that's something that you know, I can't, if it were me, if I felt that way, yeah, I would, I would say so, look at there but for the grace of God. </sentence><sentence id="1496">Just as I say, if he had won, I'd be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Or I'd be slave labor, yeah if he'd been, but he wasn't, he was a part of Hitler's entourage and he was very much, very much in favor with Hitler through most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="1498">He was a part of the <span class="dlf">inner circle</span>, he was for a long time the second in command, if Hitler had died he would have gotten the, the, he would have been head of <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1499">It's a remarkable thing for a man who at that time was in his 30's and then 40's. </sentence><sentence id="1500">I asked him about <span class="populated place">Spandau</span> you know, but basically I got the fairly standard answers, he, it fascinated me also, was I guess one of the other things, surprised I mentioned that he had showed me the original manuscript. </sentence><sentence id="1501">If you could take pieces of torn out paper, just take about 600 pieces of skinny, torn out paper, no more than three inches, with a tiny Germanic hand written on it, then you'll know what the manuscript is, this whole stack of papers which he got out, I guess got out through Margaretta(ph), but that was the manuscript of his book. </sentence><sentence id="1502">So remember this, he was writing that book while he was still in <span class="populated place">Spandau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1503">The thing that also bothers me, I think, if I think about it, and you say you know, what were my real feelings about him. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Remember also that the book changed in context from the German to the American version. </sentence><sentence id="1505">The whole section on anti- Semitism was toned down. </sentence><sentence id="1506">The whole, a whole, no, yes, well no, when you say after I did the interview, no, they, it was being done while I was doing the interview, that book was not out, I only This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1507">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1508"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 saw the book in manuscript, but I had not seen the German version. </sentence><sentence id="1509">But the German version and the English version do not match, in several important places, because for the American audience, they felt they could not be as strong in some of the <span class="region">areas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So now that gives you a kind of a suspicion, both about Albert Speer and the people who controlled the publication of the book. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1528">Q: You talk about how he sort of gave you what he wanted to, he'd thought these answers out and yet it seems that in a way, it's like his self portrait and that's revealing too, what he does want to say about himself, Albert Speer and what he doesn't, that while you were, you feel that you weren't able to puncture it too much, it's still a self portrait. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1589">Q: Describe him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1591">A: And if I describe Albert Speer, if you talk about body language, the hand, he's sitting rather stiffly in the <span class="spatial object">chair</span>, leaning a little to the right, which is very typical, hands clasped, legs crossed, as my legs were crossed. </sentence><sentence id="1592">The difference in the two of us is that I have the whole type A finger up, pointing a finger and asking a question and he, with almost a little bit of suspicion on the question and that was very typical. </sentence><sentence id="1593">These pictures are not at all unusual, this was very typical about the whole, well we didn't interview over 10 days, we interviewed I think six or seven days of the 10 days, we had to get to know him, we had to get to know the <span class="populated place">community</span>, we had to talk about what we were going to talk about without giving away the questions and so we were I guess six days or seven days out there. </sentence><sentence id="1594">And the crew came in and we filmed. </sentence><sentence id="1595">But if you look at the photographs of him and if you look at any of the photographs of any of his interviews, the man was never relaxed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1601">Q: And actually it's different from the photographs you see of him before the end of the war because he looks very relaxed, often when he's with Hitler, if he's walking around showing some piece of architecture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1603">A: Yes, but if he's going to have an image, if he's going to make this image, remember he no longer is Hitler's number two man, he's no longer on the <span class="region">Russian front</span> looking at the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span>, he's no longer doing the architecture or running the armaments program, which was a huge program, the man did a remarkable job, considering the fact he had slave labor, but the man did a remarkable job in picking This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1604">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1605"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 <span class="country">Germany</span> up from the ruins of most of the bombing and actually turning out the <span class="spatial object">tanks</span> and the <span class="spatial object">planes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1606">He was a very, very effective bureaucrat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1611">Q: He clearly was very, very bright, the work he did and then even what he learned and studied when he was in <span class="building">prison</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1612">Were you ever intimidated by him in that sense, in the intellectual sense of jousting about the truth with a man like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1615">A: No, I was never intimidated, but I think I knew all the time I spoke to him that I was going to get the answers that he had well prepared. </sentence><sentence id="1616">I was never intimidated because basically you have to remember that deep, deep down, there was the anger and the gut feeling that he still was Hitler's number two man, that it was an experience and it was an experience. </sentence><sentence id="1617">I never, never forgot the fact that I was a Jew speaking to Hitler's number two man on a very civilized kind of a <span class="dlf">lawn</span>, you know, going in to lunch or dinner in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1618">It's a very weird, surrealist feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1619">But no, I never felt intimidation. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Nor was he the kind of man who intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="1621">Which is another point. </sentence><sentence id="1622">A lot of it had to do with him too. </sentence><sentence id="1623">He was not arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="1624">We think of some, particularly when we see the movies with the Nazi arm bands and you think of the arrogance and the arrogance of the Gestapo and so on, this was not the kind of man he was and he may not have even been that during the war, but I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1635">Q: Just a moment ago we were talking about the emotion finally coming out, I don't know if it did at one point and we got sidetracked, I want to just come back to that question. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1664">A: And the mask, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1665">Which in a sense is not the best way to get an interview, it's easier to interview a doctor who's a neurosurgeon, ask him about brain surgery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1668">Q: That's what I wanted to ask, I don't know if there's something we haven't touched on that we should say about the interview, about the tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1670">A: The tapes, there's nothing more I can say about the interview or the tapes, I would like to find the other two tapes, remembering that they also were accompanied by film and so it would be interesting to see at this point if one of the questions you asked about came off on film. </sentence><sentence id="1671">Was there any point where he showed any of this other reaction, emotion or whatever it may be, discomfort. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I would have to see the uncut film because even the cut film would only have the correct answers. </sentence><sentence id="1673">But in seeing the uncut film you would know because we went on I don't know how many rolls or how many hours we had. </sentence><sentence id="1674">In order to do 10, 10 minutes films, plus a film on the architecture in a totalitarian regime, which was 10 minutes, you're talking 100 minutes of finished film. </sentence><sentence id="1675">I don't recall This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1676">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1677"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 what we shot, we must have had a truckload of film when we went back because we kept rolling through all these things. </sentence><sentence id="1678">Today with videotape, it would be cheaper, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1691">A: Yes, well every time, every, one day when we were out there, we surveyed it for the first couple of days, it was perfect, the birds were chirping and the first day we were going to film, there was a storm over <span class="populated place">Frankfort</span>, we didn't know this, all we knew is a <span class="spatial object">jet</span> came over. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Then another <span class="spatial object">jet</span> came over, then another and you know that, that's it for tape and I kept stopping the tape and stopping the film and he said, "Oh," he said, "whenever there's a storm in <span class="populated place">Frankfort</span>, the <span class="spatial object">planes</span> circle over Heidelberg(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1693">So for about two hours we had nothing but <span class="spatial object">jets</span> circling over Heidelberg(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1694">For a film maker this is death, this is terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1695">Overall it's, look, it's been with me this many years, I still read about him, I still can't get enough about him. </sentence><sentence id="1696">If I see him on television on some film about World War 2, I still sit up and take notice. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Having lived in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> right after the war, I know the VonSay(ph) <span class="building">house</span>, I was very involved with that whole <span class="region">area</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1698">As a Jew in <span class="country">Germany</span>, there were, there were lots of problems. </sentence><sentence id="1699">In fact, to show how it works, when Cheryl first came over and to show my anger, we were living in Max Schmelling's(ph), Max Schmelling(ph) was a boxer, was a heavyweight boxer, who was the German champ, who was beaten by Joe Louis and in in <span class="populated place">Berlin</span> and a woman came to the <span class="dlf">door</span>. </sentence><sentence id="1700">We had just received a package from the <span class="country">States</span> to supplement our GI rations, which were plentiful anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And there were lots of people there, there were lots of displaces persons. </sentence><sentence id="1702">There were the <span class="populated place">camps</span>, the <span class="populated place">DP camps</span> and we did know some DP's and we did go to the <span class="populated place">camps</span> and we were very involved with them. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And in radio, I was involved with the documentaries. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And there was a knock on the <span class="dlf">door</span> and a woman came to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and Cheryl came to the <span class="dlf">door</span> and the woman said, "I'm hungry, is there something I can have to eat?" </sentence><sentence id="1705">And I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="1706">And Cheryl said, "You can't do that to somebody who is hungry." </sentence><sentence id="1707">And she This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1708">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1709"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 went in and she got a can of salmon and she gave it to the woman. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And we had our first big married fight, because I was so angry that they had starved people, that they had put them in <span class="interior space">gas chambers</span>, I mean I don't have to go through the whole litany, they had done all these things and she said you can't turn a woman who is hungry away. </sentence><sentence id="1711">So obviously then and obviously even to this day, my gut feeling is, I find it difficult to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I find it difficult to hear German spoken. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I find it difficult to meet someone of my generation who was in <span class="country">Germany</span> in 1940, "41, "42. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Can't help it. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So in that sense I've come away with a very, an even stronger emotional feeling and my speaking to Albert Speer is just one of those little bricks in that whole thing of <span class="building">building</span> how I feel today and I would do it again, as I said to you before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
