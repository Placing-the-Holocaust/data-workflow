<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: [Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="125">What did you like to study? </sentence><sentence id="126">Did you like studying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: I was a very good student. </sentence><sentence id="131">My mother - my mother calls me a genius, and I believed her.[Laughs.] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Well, your sisters call you a genius too, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: That's - my mother was very proud of me because I was very well brought up, like I had very nice manners and since I was a little assimilated and I had a lot of Polish girlfriends, usually the Polish parents did not like the <span class="building">Datastrassas</span> (ph), the Jews, but since I was so well brought up and polite at all time, and I was helping them with <span class="building">school</span>, I was always welcome to their <span class="building">homes</span>, and to me, at that time, it was very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Why was it so important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a Jew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don't forget, that that was at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: So, explain how to me persecuted as a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="144">What was it like for you as a Jewish child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our <span class="populated place">town</span>, there was a lot of religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="148">Most of the Jewish people that lived in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span> were religious, and I always saw Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them, and so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn't feel it, and being with the Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn't feel it, but I saw it on the outside, and that's why maybe I wanted to be one of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: To a point, because they - they couldn't speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="153">I mean, they spoke Polish with an accent. </sentence><sentence id="154">They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="158">They were dressed differently. </sentence><sentence id="159">They acted differently. </sentence><sentence id="160">They spoke differently. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, but I identified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Do you remember what the population of <span class="populated place">Starachowice</span> was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Yes, it was - <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> were like <span class="populated place">twin cities</span>, if you can call that that. </sentence><sentence id="169">That total population was 35,000, and ten percent of it were Jewish people like between 3,200 to 3,500. </sentence><sentence id="170">And, most of them lived in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>; some Poles lived in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>, too. </sentence><sentence id="171"><span class="populated place">Starachowice</span> was mostly - in <span class="populated place">Starachowice</span>, there were mostly - not mostly, I would say almost 95 percent Poles. </sentence><sentence id="172">They worked there because we had the <span class="building">munition factory</span> there. </sentence><sentence id="173">They worked there and they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="174">Some of them lived in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>, too, but all Jews lived in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: You left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: I left. </sentence><sentence id="185">My mother sent me to <span class="building">school</span> in <span class="populated place">Radom</span> when I was eleven years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Was that an ordinary thing? </sentence><sentence id="189">Why did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call <span class="building">Gymnasium</span>, which was a <span class="building">high school</span> in <span class="populated place">Starachowice</span>, but it wasn't one of the best. </sentence><sentence id="193">In <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, there was - there was one of the best <span class="building">girls" school</span>, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="194">At first, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a <span class="building">class</span> would be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means none of the Jewish girls could be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="196">You have to pass a competitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, my mother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she found out that I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="198">So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could ever achieve at the time which - and I went to that <span class="building">school</span> there and I lived on my own. </sentence><sentence id="199">Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a <span class="interior space">room</span>, with like there were kids there my age. </sentence><sentence id="200">So, she rented a <span class="interior space">room</span> with a family, and that's where I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Did that scare you to go away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: At first it did. </sentence><sentence id="213">As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I found myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to know all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several <span class="building">schools</span> in <span class="populated place">Radom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was a big <span class="populated place">city</span> with 100,000 people there. </sentence><sentence id="215">They had several different <span class="building">schools</span>. </sentence><sentence id="216">They even had a <span class="building">Jewish high school</span>, called <span class="building">Pzhiachu Wierze</span> (ph), which meant  "friends of knowledge", if I were to translate it exactly. </sentence><sentence id="217">So, there were a lot of Jewish kids that were educated in <span class="populated place">Starachowice</span>, <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="218">The religious people didn't send the girls to <span class="building">high school</span> because of the fact that they had to go to <span class="building">school</span> on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="219">You know, because we had six days of <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="220">So, the parents wouldn't let them do that. </sentence><sentence id="221">So, they had a lot of other <span class="building">schools</span> that were connected with the religious movement. </sentence><sentence id="222">But in <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger <span class="populated place">city</span>, and there was a lot of young people that were going to those different <span class="building">schools</span>, and the <span class="building">schools</span> were much better than in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger <span class="populated place">city</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there. </sentence><sentence id="237">As a matter of fact, until today, I have a lot of friends from <span class="populated place">Radom</span>. </sentence><sentence id="238">And, as a matter of fact, my husband made a party for them all like at the <span class="building">cottage</span> a year before he died. </sentence><sentence id="239">There was fifty of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Really. </sentence><sentence id="245">And, what were your favorite subjects? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: At the time, languages and mathematics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Mathematics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Did that come from your father since he was an engineer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, that's true. [ </sentence><sentence id="257">Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="258">It was -talking about <span class="building">home</span>, when he counted, he counted in German, because he was educated in German. </sentence><sentence id="259">I count - no matter what language I speak - if I have to count, I count in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="260">My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he would count in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="261">And since you are talking about languages.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: How do you account for that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="271">So, I was used to speaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting. </sentence><sentence id="272">I think it's very normal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you write <span class="building">home</span> a great deal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Well, I did write <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="279">Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff like that, a <span class="spatial object">parcel</span>, and then, whoever would travel to <span class="populated place">Radom</span>, she would send something for me. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="281">We didn't have a <span class="spatial object">telephone</span> at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Did you write to your sisters? </sentence><sentence id="287">Or does the one letter count? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: One letter. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Did they write to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="296">As a matter of fact, the month of September, since <span class="populated place">Radom</span> was about sixty kilometers away from <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>, it was a two hour ride on the <span class="spatial object">train</span> because I had to change <span class="spatial object">trains</span> half way. </sentence><sentence id="297">So, at the beginning, I didn't want to go back to <span class="populated place">Radom</span> because when I was at <span class="building">home</span> it felt so good to be at <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="298">So, the first month, I was traveling every day to <span class="populated place">Radom</span> and back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Every day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Every day to get <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="306">But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="307">But I had a very, very good life in <span class="populated place">Radom</span> because, as a say, I had lots of friends there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: Do you remember the <span class="building">Paliszewskis</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Yes, I remember them very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: Were you close to them also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: Very close. </sentence><sentence id="318">Those were the Polish friends of my parents, and we were very close. </sentence><sentence id="319">The father was - I mean, we called him a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="320">He didn't have an education, but he, I mean, maybe he wasn't a doctor really, but he was acting as a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="321">And there were four daughters there and they opened, how should I say, a <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="322">Since the age of two or so, we went to that <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="323">It was like a - I don't know whether to call it a <span class="building">kindergarten</span> or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="324">And they taught us - they taught us to such a degree that when I went to <span class="building">public school</span>, the transferred me immediately the first day because I could read and write already, and then I skipped again, because they were very good teachers and they were very good friends of our parents. </sentence><sentence id="325">We went there for Christmas and I enjoyed so much seeing the <span class="env feature">Christmas tree</span> and she had home baked cookies on the <span class="env feature">tree</span>. </sentence><sentence id="326">We really liked it, and they were very, very good friends of our parents. </sentence><sentence id="327">As a matter of fact, they kept certain things for us, like valuables and they - and this was the only family that returned our valuables after the war because I also had - we also had friends, they were also teachers, that we left some clothes and stuff like this, and when we came back, they wouldn't give us anything. </sentence><sentence id="328">Not only that they wouldn't give us anything, but they said, "Tf you are need, go to the <span class="building">Jewish congress</span>." </sentence><sentence id="329">So, the Paliszewskis were very, very exceptional. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: So, in your experience with Polish Catholics, that's an unusual experience, the Paliszewskis, the way they were with you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Very unusual, but they weren't - maybe they were, but I thought they came from the <span class="region">Russian side</span> so maybe they were, whatever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Greek Orthodox? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Greek Orthodox, I'm not sure, maybe not, but Christmas was Christmas, so maybe they weren't, but they spoke with a Russian accent. </sentence><sentence id="336">They weren't born in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>; they came from the <span class="region">Russian side</span>. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: So, you never got on the <span class="spatial object">horse</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2888">Q: Were you the first of the three? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2890">A: I was one of the first ones. </sentence><sentence id="2891">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2892">Renia says that one of them recovered before I, but I - I don't remember whether Renia or Krysia told me that I was really very sick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="2893">I was delirious. </sentence><sentence id="2894">But  9 once, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high fever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and you were contagious, you weren't as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came, when your temperature went right down, you couldn't move, and this was - if you survived the crisis, you lived. </sentence><sentence id="2895">Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself, but a lot of people didn't survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you about <span class="populated place">Sulamite</span> (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2896">Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick. </sentence><sentence id="2897">The Germans decided they'd have to kill off the people that are sick. </sentence><sentence id="2898">So, what they did, the decided, the army came in. </sentence><sentence id="2899">It was as they - it wasn't - it wasn't because they needed soldiers to put all the sick ones on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span> to take them out. </sentence><sentence id="2900">So, what they did, they told the policemen that everybody had to come out of the <span class="building">barracks</span>, whether he was sick or healthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run. </sentence><sentence id="2901">Whoever could run - the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the crisis, they couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2902">So, those were put on the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>, and they called me from the <span class="building">office</span> to write down the names of the people that were going on the <span class="spatial object">trucks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2903">Also, at that time, every policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few <span class="building">barracks</span> or one <span class="building">barrack</span>, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that was in the <span class="building">barrack</span> came out. </sentence><sentence id="2904">So, at that time, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my husband's sister's husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered because they person couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="2905">So, later after what happened when they found the sick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman. </sentence><sentence id="2906">Cogord (ph) was killed right on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="2907">Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good friends from <span class="populated place">Lodz</span>, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they were twins, but they were always together. </sentence><sentence id="2908">One's name was <span class="populated place">Sulamite</span> (ph), and the other Mira (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2909">One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph) couldn't run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he sent her to, for me to write her name down. </sentence><sentence id="2910">So, I thought that they will take her to the <span class="spatial object">truck</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2911">So, I asked - I didn't know those people because they came especially for that function. </sentence><sentence id="2912">They were Becker's people. </sentence><sentence id="2913">You know, Becker was outside the <span class="populated place">Lagers</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2914"><span class="building">Sicherheit Polizei</span> or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist, | think they were called. </sentence><sentence id="2915">So, those people were assigned this function. </sentence><sentence id="2916">So, I said to the guy that was standing near me, "Please leave her. </sentence><sentence id="2917">She's my best friend." </sentence><sentence id="2918">So, he says, "Oh, she is, eh?" </sentence><sentence id="2919">He took out the gun and killed her right in my presence. </sentence><sentence id="2920">So, I remember that - I didn't remember - I don't remember what happened to me because I fainted, but the policemen later told me they got me quickly off my job, put me in the <span class="building">police barracks</span>, covered me there, and the policeman was writing down the names after later. </sentence><sentence id="2921">So, that was very traumatic to me because I saw it with my own eye. </sentence><sentence id="2922">I mean, it wasn't her fault. </sentence><sentence id="2923">She was sick, and all I did, I felt - I felt guilty because I told him she was my friend, but I thought that if I would tell him that she was friend, that he would spare her life, but he just killed her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2958">Q: So, in some sense, you think you're responsible for that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2960">A: I felt that - I thought that maybe if I would have leaved her or something, but I said, "She's my best friend, please leave her. </sentence><sentence id="2961">Let her go." </sentence><sentence id="2962">So, he killed her. </sentence><sentence id="2963"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2968">Q: Was that the first time you saw anything quite like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2970">A: No, things happened before when Altov (ph) was killing. </sentence><sentence id="2971">I remember, one day he made one Jew dance, like, I don't know, he - he - and he killed him there, and then I watched from the <span class="dlf">office window</span> when he killed him, they called the Ukrainian to take him away, so the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and the <span class="populated place">camp</span> was full of <span class="env feature">sand</span> or something. </sentence><sentence id="2972">So, he was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him, and you know all this <span class="env feature">sand</span> was - how should I say - covering the face of this Jewish man. </sentence><sentence id="2973">So, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody looked, but when he came and he always killed a few people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2978">Q: What sort of affect does this have on you? </sentence><sentence id="2979">Do you stop feeling things? </sentence><sentence id="2980">I mean, as you start seeing so much brutality, what...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2984">A: Well, it was traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="2985">It was traumatic, very traumatic, and it made us cry, but we couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="2986">I mean, we got so used to it that at night, when we were in the <span class="building">barrack</span>, we sang. </sentence><sentence id="2987">Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs. </sentence><sentence id="2988">They were different from the songs that we sang in the past. </sentence><sentence id="2989">Today's your turn and tomorrow's going to be our turn. </sentence><sentence id="2990">So, we never knew whose turn it was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="2991">So, we really didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="2992">We wanted to live - life, the will for life was very strong, but not to a point to, you know, to such - because we knew that today's their turn, and tomorrow's going to be ours. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3242">A: Because everything happened the same time. </sentence><sentence id="3243">So, maybe I'll start with <span class="populated place">Tobah</span> (ph) because maybe it will be shorter. </sentence><sentence id="3244">I don't know that much about her, but about my husband's escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="3245">So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a <span class="spatial object">car</span> with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3246">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3247">Then, she came back. </sentence><sentence id="3248">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3249">Then, a few days later, he came for <span class="populated place">Tobah</span> (ph) again. </sentence><sentence id="3250">Took her himself already. </sentence><sentence id="3251">He took her out again. </sentence><sentence id="3252">He was very polite. </sentence><sentence id="3253">I remember because I was near the <span class="building">office</span>, like they brought her to the <span class="building">office</span>, and you know, I could look through the <span class="dlf">window</span> and see. </sentence><sentence id="3254">He opened the <span class="dlf">door</span> for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day. </sentence><sentence id="3255">The third time, he took her out - I don't know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. </sentence><sentence id="3256">Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a <span class="dlf">grave</span>, and of course, it was like, they called him to work. </sentence><sentence id="3257">He didn't know it was going to be for him. </sentence><sentence id="3258">So, he started digging but he was an older man. </sentence><sentence id="3259">It took him a little time. </sentence><sentence id="3260">So, Schrodt came out of his <span class="building">office</span>, and he  5 took the gun and killed him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="3261">The <span class="dlf">grave</span> wasn't dug exactly - like, the <span class="dlf">grave</span> was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. </sentence><sentence id="3262">And she never came back. </sentence><sentence id="3263">Then we found out, because they were from <span class="populated place">Opatow</span> - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3264">Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="3265">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3266">She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her. </sentence><sentence id="3267">I didn't know what happened to her because they didn't bring her to <span class="populated place">camp</span>, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. </sentence><sentence id="3268">He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the <span class="dlf">grave</span> was found later in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. </sentence><sentence id="3269">So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that's how she perished, and her father, for money. </sentence><sentence id="3270">Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3300">Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3302">A: Because I suppose they decided they didn't want to have any witnesses because nobody knew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3308">Q: Didn't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3310">A: Didn't know what for they are taking her out. </sentence><sentence id="3311">Because he was - when he was digging the <span class="dlf">grave</span>, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt killed him even before he finished. </sentence><sentence id="3312">Like, he just killed him in front, like during the daytime, when everybody looked on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3316">Q: Did you see that killing? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3332">A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate with any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people. </sentence><sentence id="3333">They were animals. </sentence><sentence id="3334">So, you are talking about the people in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, the people that lived in <span class="populated place">camp</span> or the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3444">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3445">So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when things were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3446">It was an idea that we didn't know how to achieve it, but we knew one thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3447">And this was very secretive. </sentence><sentence id="3448">All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong  8 people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed. </sentence><sentence id="3449">So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it. </sentence><sentence id="3450">So, we decided he's going to buy guns. </sentence><sentence id="3451">We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going <span class="building">home</span>, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work. </sentence><sentence id="3452">They didn't keep the <span class="spatial object">guns</span> with them. </sentence><sentence id="3453">So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. </sentence><sentence id="3454">He was the one to purchase this gun. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3472">Q: No, where did it get it from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3474">A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. </sentence><sentence id="3475">They paid for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect. </sentence><sentence id="3476">And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price. </sentence><sentence id="3477">I don't remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things. </sentence><sentence id="3478">When I say other things, some people were, in <span class="populated place">Wierzbnik</span>, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and <span class="spatial object">furniture</span> and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3479">So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let's say, two watches or something. </sentence><sentence id="3480">Take the two watches and bring me a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3481">I don't remember exactly how he got the first gun because that's as far as he got, the first gun. </sentence><sentence id="3482">On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. </sentence><sentence id="3483">Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3484">So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, "He doesn't know the name, but there is one of the policemen." </sentence><sentence id="3485">So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, "This is the policeman that bought from me the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3486">Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, "I never bought from him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3487">I don't know him. </sentence><sentence id="3488">I didn't - I never saw him." </sentence><sentence id="3489">But, of course, they didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="3490">He was interrogated and we had such a <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, a small <span class="interior space">bunker</span> that was made out of concrete. </sentence><sentence id="3491">They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to <span class="populated place">Becker</span>, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn't have any problems finding him, and he's going to be condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3492">So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him. </sentence><sentence id="3493">This is the guy who took out , So, he says, "Okay, if you give me..." No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, "How do you know? </sentence><sentence id="3494">Maybe he's lying. </sentence><sentence id="3495">Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the investigation is through. </sentence><sentence id="3496">If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how you can take an innocent man? </sentence><sentence id="3497">I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why  9 he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3498">So, they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="3499">They put him in this <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, and he had to dig his own <span class="dlf">grave</span>, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he's condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3500">He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a <span class="dlf">grave</span> was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. </sentence><sentence id="3501">A kilo of gold, but we didn't have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to <span class="populated place">Becker</span> and this <span class="populated place">Baumgarten</span> to say, "Now, you can start the investigation." </sentence><sentence id="3502">So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the <span class="interior space">bunker</span>, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a <span class="spatial object">bench</span>, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with <span class="dlf">holes</span> in it? </sentence><sentence id="3503">They put it over the head. </sentence><sentence id="3504">They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. </sentence><sentence id="3505">So, you know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. </sentence><sentence id="3506">He says he couldn't even feel anything. </sentence><sentence id="3507">He didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3508">So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the <span class="building">police barrack</span> there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody. </sentence><sentence id="3509">But he was a very strong boy, and don't forget that in 1943 he was nineteen. </sentence><sentence id="3510">So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. </sentence><sentence id="3511">They put him in the <span class="building">barrack</span> and they said, "This is only so that he can't escape or can't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="3512">So, they took him from the <span class="building">bunker</span> because he couldn't breathe there, and they put him in the <span class="building">barrack</span>, and the next day they called in <span class="building">appel</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3513">Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an <span class="spatial object">appel</span> so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn't say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3514">They didn't know about the <span class="spatial object">gun</span> that already existed. </sentence><sentence id="3515">They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited <span class="populated place">Adrian</span> later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="3516">So, when everybody was standing at the <span class="spatial object">appel</span> and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people. </sentence><sentence id="3517">So, they went to Adrian's <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3518">They took him out. </sentence><sentence id="3519">They had some <span class="spatial object">shears</span>, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3520">But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people. </sentence><sentence id="3521">I don't know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. </sentence><sentence id="3522">The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3523">So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the <span class="dlf">barbed wire</span> and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before. </sentence><sentence id="3524">They jumped over the <span class="dlf">fence</span> and started running. </sentence><sentence id="3525">They had to run quickly over the <span class="dlf">road</span> because on the other side of the <span class="dlf">road</span> there were <span class="env feature">forests</span> and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted is to get to the  0 <span class="env feature">forest</span> as fast as they could. </sentence><sentence id="3526">But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting. </sentence><sentence id="3527">So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="3528">He had a <span class="spatial object">motorcycle</span> and he started running after them. </sentence><sentence id="3529">But until they found they were a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="3530">So, anyway they managed to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span> and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, "I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ." </sentence><sentence id="3531">which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed personally. </sentence><sentence id="3532">So, we all thought that he's dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that he's completely dead. </sentence><sentence id="3533">Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, and what are they going to do? </sentence><sentence id="3534">I mean, they run away the way they were. </sentence><sentence id="3535">Nothing - they had nothing on them. </sentence><sentence id="3536">They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don't know why Adrian didn't take his gun. </sentence><sentence id="3537">I never asked him that question, but when they reached the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, they were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="3538">And we had three kinds of partisans in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3539">One -

the real anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="3550">So, anyway, they were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="3551">I remember four names - three names - four names. </sentence><sentence id="3552">I remember four names of the escapees. </sentence><sentence id="3553">I don't remember the rest. </sentence><sentence id="3554">So, it was <span class="populated place">Adrian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3555">It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from <span class="populated place">Warsaw ghetto</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3556">And, the third one was Freumik Singer (ph), he was from <span class="populated place">Opatow</span> - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum (ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were six others, but I really don't remember their names now. </sentence><sentence id="3557">So, as they were waiting in the <span class="env feature">forest</span>, the Russian group came by. </sentence><sentence id="3558">So, they told them that they are from camp escapees and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3559">So the guys said, "I can't take ten. </sentence><sentence id="3560">We can't take ten. </sentence><sentence id="3561">We don't have <span class="interior space">room</span> for ten. </sentence><sentence id="3562">We don't have arms for ten." </sentence><sentence id="3563">Because the supplies came directly from <span class="country">Russia</span> by <span class="spatial object">plane</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3564">So, they couldn't take so many. </sentence><sentence id="3565">So, he says, "We can only take two of you." </sentence><sentence id="3566">So, he picked up this <span class="spatial object">Freumik</span> (ph) from <span class="populated place">Opatow</span> and they picked <span class="populated place">Adrian</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3567">And, he says, "And you stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don't have <span class="interior space">room</span>." </sentence><sentence id="3568">There was apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group. </sentence><sentence id="3569">So, there were 27 of them. </sentence><sentence id="3570">Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I'1l come back later to those. </sentence><sentence id="3571">I'Il say what happened to them later. </sentence><sentence id="3572">So, anyway they started to - they needed miner. </sentence><sentence id="3573">What I mean miners - the ones who will put <span class="dlf">mines</span> under <span class="dlf">bridges</span> so that the German arms couldn't put them in <span class="spatial object">trains</span> like - what they had to do, they had to put <span class="dlf">mines</span> under the <span class="dlf">bridges</span>, but the <span class="dlf">mines</span> were not like today's sophisticated. </sentence><sentence id="3574">They had their mine. </sentence><sentence id="3575">They had the string. </sentence><sentence id="3576">They had to first go by <span class="spatial object">boat</span>, don't forget the Germans were watching. </sentence><sentence id="3577">They were over every <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that's what they were afraid of, that the <span class="dlf">bridges</span> would be mined. </sentence><sentence id="3578">So, they had to swim or go by such a <span class="spatial object">boat</span> that couldn't hear anything under the <span class="dlf">bridge</span>, put the mine there, go far enough with the string, wait until the <span class="spatial object">train</span> comes - goes by, and pull it. </sentence><sentence id="3579">It was a very dangerous job, and very  1 specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the <span class="env feature">river</span>, they were shooting them right away. </sentence><sentence id="3580">So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3581">They had people that were in the <span class="populated place">village</span>, <span class="populated place">Polish villages</span> that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened here and there. </sentence><sentence id="3582">So, they had contact with the world. </sentence><sentence id="3583">They had enough to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="3584">I mean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, "You wouldn't believe what I could eat - this pure fat." </sentence><sentence id="3585">And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. </sentence><sentence id="3586">So, they weren't really hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3587">They slept in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, and they were doing the mine work. </sentence><sentence id="3588">That was their work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3709">Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no question about whether these guys were Jewish, or they said they were not Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3711">A: No, they didn't say. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And, they knew that they were Jewish, and to such a point they said that they are happy that Adrian had the name Wilczek (ph) which means "little wolf" because everybody in the partisan group had a nickname and the nickname was an animal. </sentence><sentence id="3713">Do you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="3714">Like, he was called a cat, a dog, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3715">So, he had - his name "little wolf" was suitable, but they knew that they were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3721">Q: Tell me something, Adrian's physical condition then... Did anybody take care of him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3723">A: And, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="3724">That's what I'm going to say. </sentence><sentence id="3725">At first, they let him rest because they told them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3726">So, those were the Russians, mostly Russians there. </sentence><sentence id="3727">Anyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for whatever reason, and they told him that they can't take him because he couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="3728">So, he asked them to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3729">He said, "Maybe if you kill me because I..." But they couldn't kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3730">So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3731">They covered him up. </sentence><sentence id="3732">They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there. </sentence><sentence id="3733">They kissed him and they said, "We are very sorry," because they left him there to die because he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="3734">So some people were going by the <span class="env feature">woods</span> and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3735">They were the people that were saying where the Germans are. </sentence><sentence id="3736">So, they took him <span class="building">home</span> and they, and it took him ten days and he was better. </sentence><sentence id="3737">So, he decided to go back to his group. </sentence><sentence id="3738">When he went to his - before he went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said, "T'm sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group. </sentence><sentence id="3739">The  2 Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those <span class="building">buildings</span>, they put it afire and everybody got killed. </sentence><sentence id="3740">So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="3741">So, he went...he went back to the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, after he felt better, and he decided he'll wait for another group. </sentence><sentence id="3742">I'll tell you more about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story first. </sentence><sentence id="3743">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3775">A: He - he was a Jewish boy. </sentence><sentence id="3776">He never had - he wasn't violent. </sentence><sentence id="3777">He never saw a gun in his life. </sentence><sentence id="3778">I don't think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless someone will tell him or show him. </sentence><sentence id="3779">I don't know whether the gun was - the gun that he bought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and whether - I couldn't tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he had it, he wouldn't know how to use it unless someone would show it to him. </sentence><sentence id="3780">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3787">Q: So, tell me, of these boys who were planning the break-out... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3789">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3791">Q: And, you were involved, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3793">A: I was involved. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3795">Q: Right, were there other women involved as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3797">A: I was involved. </sentence><sentence id="3798">Some women were involved because we're talking about uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3799">So, the women were also involved. </sentence><sentence id="3800">Like, we didn't think it would be so fast. </sentence><sentence id="3801">We thought that it would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a strata-strategy. </sentence><sentence id="3802">It wasn't - this was just the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="3803">We had no idea what's - what's going to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like that, if the Germans would have found out, it would've been death to all of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3811">Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3813">A: That's the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the strongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3815">Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3817">A: One would tell - we didn't meet. </sentence><sentence id="3818">They would - one of the policemen would come to me and tell me what they decided. </sentence><sentence id="3819">One would tell the other one who'd tell - we didn't meet. </sentence><sentence id="3820">There wasn't no meeting. </sentence><sentence id="3821">I mean, how could you make a meeting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3827">Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn't know how those things happen. </sentence><sentence id="3828"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3831">A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that. </sentence><sentence id="3832">So, I knew it, and maybe - I don't know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3833">Maybe she did. </sentence><sentence id="3834">I couldn't tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell so and so, but not in certain - we didn't have meetings. </sentence><sentence id="3835">We couldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3841">Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3843">A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to people - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="3844">He was the type of a person that - that he knew how to - to get things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3847">Q: And who had experience with arms in this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3849">A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn't carry anything in their hands. </sentence><sentence id="3850">I mean, I'm talking the Jewish policemen. </sentence><sentence id="3851">I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they were - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn't have to go to the <span class="building">factory</span> and - and work at the <span class="spatial object">iron stove</span> where it was so hot that they couldn't breathe. </sentence><sentence id="3852">So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all thinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to that - we went like sheep to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3857">Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you're not supposed to have conversations because it's too dangerous, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3859">A: No, it's too dangerous, and I'll tell you, I couldn't take a part in the running away, anyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one. </sentence><sentence id="3860">If one escaped, they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3863">Q: So, you were not going to take any chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3865">A: I wouldn't because I had my father and my two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="3866">You couldn't take <span class="populated place">Renia</span> with you, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen, we didn't - we didn't expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3867">First we had to get the <span class="spatial object">guns</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3868">I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren't successful because we just started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3873">Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3875">A: As many as possible. </sentence><sentence id="3876">That's why ten of them - ten of them were from this group. </sentence><sentence id="3877">The ten people were from this group that ran away that night - that day. </sentence><sentence id="3878"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever the fifteen or whoever many of that group could run away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to get other guns somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="3886">Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and free all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn't believe, but you had to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you know, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn't know about - about what happened in <span class="populated place">Treblinka</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3887">We didn't know that there was an <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how did we know? </sentence><sentence id="3888">Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us all. </sentence><sentence id="3889">So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best opportunity because the guards weren't there - only one guard. </sentence><sentence id="3890">The Germans and everybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3897">Q: So, now Adrian having gotten better, and his... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3899"> A He came - he came to - he come - he's in the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, but of course, already half his time - like he was there for a long time with them, because I didn't tell you, that all he did was the <span class="dlf">mines</span> and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3900">I didn't tell you everything that happened because it wasn't important, but now - now it's already close to - already deg44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3903">Q: So, he's with them almost a year or six months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3905">A: Yes, he's been with them for a long time, but that's when he got sick and they left him. </sentence><sentence id="3906">Like, he was working every day that he had another assignment. </sentence><sentence id="3907">Most of them, he was a specialist in mining. </sentence><sentence id="3908">He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist in it. </sentence><sentence id="3909">Because they had to observe the - the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> going up. </sentence><sentence id="3910">Like, when he had this string, he had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="3911">He had to - he - he activated the <span class="dlf">mine</span>, the <span class="dlf">bridge</span> went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had to run away back to the <span class="env feature">forest</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3912">So, each - each of such escapade was very, very dangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3921">Q: So, they taught him how to do all this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3923">A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later. </sentence><sentence id="3924">I mean, after - because they carried guns all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3927">Q: So, now he's waiting for another group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3929">A: He's been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already deg44, Don't forget that the war in <span class="country">Poland</span> - in <span class="country">Poland</span>, in the <span class="env feature">woods</span> there or in this <span class="populated place">district</span> already finished around January of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3930">So, that was shortly before - before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3931">Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he  6 was in <span class="country">Poland</span>, the Russians were very close. </sentence><sentence id="3932">So, January was already the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3933">So, anyway, when he came back to the <span class="env feature">woods</span>, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got him. </sentence><sentence id="3934">So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I know one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how do you call it now? </sentence><sentence id="3935">The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3943">Q: <span class="spatial object">Tern</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5016">Q: Do you think that's significant in any way? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5070">A: Crying and screaming and that's why they jumped, because it didn't matter to them. </sentence><sentence id="5071">They jumped the <span class="spatial object">train</span> because it was better to be shot then to go wherever, I mean, in such conditions. </sentence><sentence id="5072">We didn't where we were going, because I believed that we were going to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> to work, like, to another <span class="populated place">labor camp</span> to work, but that was me. </sentence><sentence id="5073">I wanted to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="5074">But other people, I don't know whether they knew we were going to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, but some people preferred to die than to go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5120">A: I was. </sentence><sentence id="5121">Because I - I knew that he wasn't the same strong man as he was before, but we were also afraid of us. </sentence><sentence id="5122">Like, I was afraid that Renia would never survive because - not because I was afraid that they would kill her or anything, but that she was not healthy enough to survive such hard times. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5174">A: Organized, most practical, she always found us food. </sentence><sentence id="5175">She was very, very, very good at that way. </sentence><sentence id="5176">And she always shared not only with us, she shared it with others. </sentence><sentence id="5177">And I was a devil. </sentence><sentence id="5178">I wasn't afraid of anything. </sentence><sentence id="5179">I was just not afraid, and I'll tell you, since I was the tallest, there was always a risk that whenever there was a selection or they looked for somebody to work for a job or whatever, they would always - always - even if I was in the back. </sentence><sentence id="5180">Like, Krysia says, "Don't stay in the front, stay in the back. </sentence><sentence id="5181">They'll take you to take blood. </sentence><sentence id="5182">They'll take you to do this." </sentence><sentence id="5183">So, but no matter where I stood they - because I was a tall sticking out - so, "This one." </sentence><sentence id="5184">But, sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn't so good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5222">A: No, we were in the last <span class="spatial object">car</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5223">I think that my father was in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> before us, or two before us, because I don't remember whether all the women were one after the other or they picked a <span class="spatial object">car</span> full of women, then men and then women. </sentence><sentence id="5224">I don't know, because we were in the last <span class="spatial object">car</span>, and I know that my father was fairly close by. </sentence><sentence id="5225">So, Krysia thinks that he was in the <span class="spatial object">car</span> right after us. </sentence><sentence id="5226">I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was under the impression that they kept women separately so, they must have been in the third <span class="spatial object">car</span>, but he was close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5232">Q: What was it like when the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were opened? </sentence><sentence id="5233">Was it...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5236">A: When the <span class="dlf">doors</span> were opened to go out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5238">Q: To go out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5240">A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they took us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a <span class="building">crematorium</span>, or if that wasn't a <span class="building">crematorium</span>, we were told it was a <span class="building">crematorium</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5241">So, I remember having a bottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he says, "If they take you to the <span class="building">crematorium</span>..." So, we had this bottle of whiskey. </sentence><sentence id="5242">I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German soldiers stopped us in front of the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, or he called this <span class="building">crematorium</span>, so we took this bottle and every girl had a taste. </sentence><sentence id="5243">Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were thinking that we're going to die now so let's just be merry. </sentence><sentence id="5244">We never drank in our lifetimes, but the whole <span class="spatial object">bottle</span> went. </sentence><sentence id="5245">Like, as far as it went from us, and then they took us to the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few minutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where we had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress  5 with stripes, and they cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="5246">This is another story how I suffered the most out of all of three of us. </sentence><sentence id="5247">And, then we went to the <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5248">So, I'Il tell you maybe how they first brought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no brassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on - and they gave us the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5249">The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I don't know who, we changed dresses to fit us. </sentence><sentence id="5250">Because we were all very skinny, but nobody was as tall as I. They were mostly smaller people. </sentence><sentence id="5251">So, there were just a few long dresses. </sentence><sentence id="5252">I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5253">Then, they cut our hair to here. </sentence><sentence id="5254">They checked our hair for lice. </sentence><sentence id="5255">They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever you call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember, they took away my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5256">So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this was a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another <span class="populated place">camp</span> were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, "Take it, take it." </sentence><sentence id="5257">To me like, in Polish we have - like in English you say "you" it means everything, but do you understand French or German? </sentence><sentence id="5258">So, they say "vous" or "tu" or in German they said - they say, because here you say "you", in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her "Dou"(ph), you caller her "Vu" like, and the guy says, "Take those, take those." </sentence><sentence id="5259">Well I just said, "How dare you calling me "dou"?" </sentence><sentence id="5260">Okay, it was so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="5261">And, then so anyway I put those dresses - I couldn't walk in them, and then they put us five people in a <span class="dlf">row</span> to march to the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5262">So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there was three others. </sentence><sentence id="5263">They didn't want to part and we didn't want to part. </sentence><sentence id="5264">So, this woman goes, she says, "What's the commotion? </sentence><sentence id="5265">The couple there." </sentence><sentence id="5266">You know, I just came to a new <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="5267">I didn't like the way guy says to me "Dou," and here she screams at me. </sentence><sentence id="5268">I wasn't really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked before, and she says, "Go to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5269">I say, "I'm not going to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5270">She says - I say, "Those are my two sisters." </sentence><sentence id="5271">She didn't even want to hear. </sentence><sentence id="5272">She took me by the hair, grabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says, "Make a cross on her head." </sentence><sentence id="5273">So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. </sentence><sentence id="5274">So, first he made the <span class="spatial object">cross</span>, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was the only one with a really shaved head of hair. </sentence><sentence id="5275">You know, like, I didn't have anything on my head - just - I don't know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5276">Anyway, finally we just didn't want to be parted and I didn't care what she says. </sentence><sentence id="5277">She couldn't kill me, like I was daring. </sentence><sentence id="5278">I said, "I'm not going, they are my two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="5279">I'm going with them." </sentence><sentence id="5280">So, she got mad. </sentence><sentence id="5281">She pushed us. </sentence><sentence id="5282">Anyway, we're together. </sentence><sentence id="5283">I didn't want to part from them, because if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn't the next <span class="dlf">row</span> - we would have never been together. </sentence><sentence id="5284">When we came to the <span class="building">barrack</span>... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6331">Q: What did you hear and what did you read? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6333">A: That's what it is - I read all the orders. </sentence><sentence id="6334">I knew that the war is being lost. </sentence><sentence id="6335">I knew - I read all those - the letters that he gathered. </sentence><sentence id="6336">That's how we ran away. </sentence><sentence id="6337">Renia was cleaning another <span class="interior space">room</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6338">I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. </sentence><sentence id="6339">She was marvelous, but I'Il go back to this portion. </sentence><sentence id="6340">I'1l just talk now about this situation here. </sentence><sentence id="6341">So, I read everything and then, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to let everybody go except the guards, because they weren't sending the Jews anymore to work, because they had to go out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6342">So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles, but we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses across the back with the paint. </sentence><sentence id="6343">Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white cross painted like this right across the back. </sentence><sentence id="6344">So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion that she works in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span>, she gets some flour and water, and she'll be able to make the crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. </sentence><sentence id="6345">We were also distributed some clothes for us because it was a small <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6346">It wasn't a big <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6347">We were all girls. </sentence><sentence id="6348">And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a strategy. </sentence><sentence id="6349">We had a Jewish girl from <span class="populated place">Lublin</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6350">She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she spoke perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="6351">She was one of us working in the <span class="building">barracks</span> because there were either ten or twelve of us working the <span class="building">barracks</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6352">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="6353">Since she could speak so well German, we decided that she's going to steal the kapo's - you know, kapos were wearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn't wear uniforms, just a black cape with a hood. </sentence><sentence id="6354">So, she stole this <span class="spatial object">hood</span> from her, and then Krysia - we decided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just crumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run away from <span class="populated place">camp</span> - I knew exactly because my boss didn't come to work that day. </sentence><sentence id="6355">I don't know whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten  01 or twelve days before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="6356">So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was her name - she put on the <span class="spatial object">cape</span>, we made sure that there was no sign of the <span class="spatial object">cross</span>, and she - we came to the <span class="dlf">gate</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6357">She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to work outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed us to go. </sentence><sentence id="6358">We went to the <span class="dlf">road</span>, and all - from there on, we didn't have to worry because all the Germans were running towards <span class="region">west</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6359">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6360">The Russians were very close, so the Germans were leaving their <span class="building">homes</span> and everything marching, running away from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="6361">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6362">So, we were in the group. </sentence><sentence id="6363">Nobody noticed us. </sentence><sentence id="6364">Nobody bothered us, but we didn't have what to eat and we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="6365">But, we run away. </sentence><sentence id="6366">We're out of the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6367">As a matter of fact, one girl from <span class="populated place">Radom</span> that I suggested that she goes with us, she didn't want to go because she had - somebody gave her spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. </sentence><sentence id="6368">She had it with someone. </sentence><sentence id="6369">She didn't want to leave it, or she didn't - she didn't want to give it to her, and she didn't want - because she wanted to eat it, she didn't want to run away. </sentence><sentence id="6370">So, they went to another <span class="populated place">camp</span> from there, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more <span class="region">west</span>, but we were already free. </sentence><sentence id="6371">So, we - that was it. </sentence><sentence id="6372">Those were the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6373">Now, Krysia - she worked in the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending to us - she was working on the <span class="interior space">second floor</span> and so, we - we used to go under - stand under the <span class="interior space">kitchen</span> and have our metal thing with the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6374">She would push down a string. </sentence><sentence id="6375">We would put the string on the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6376">She roped it, and she would take - because there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn't get it; the Germans - the Germans got it. </sentence><sentence id="6377">We only got the soup. </sentence><sentence id="6378">So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there a big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. </sentence><sentence id="6379">We would take it and divide among all the girls. </sentence><sentence id="6380">So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were not used to such - so rich food. </sentence><sentence id="6381">It was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="6382">One day she tells me this story. </sentence><sentence id="6383">She worked there. </sentence><sentence id="6384">She stole a pound of butter. </sentence><sentence id="6385">It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, and she says she didn't know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her boss, the German cook, was watching her. </sentence><sentence id="6386">So, she put it in her pants so that she could take the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter started dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. </sentence><sentence id="6387">She - but anyway, she managed somehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="6388">So, we really in <span class="populated place">Retzow</span> we didn't have a bad day, because she was supplying all the food. </sentence><sentence id="6389">She was stealing it, but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to get whatever, they were already waiting. </sentence><sentence id="6390">I mean everybody was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="6391">So, that was also lucky. </sentence><sentence id="6392">We were lucky there. </sentence><sentence id="6393">But, this is all about <span class="populated place">Retzow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="6394">There's very -
