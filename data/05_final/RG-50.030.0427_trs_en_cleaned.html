<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2370">A: Well it seems to me that Betsy, now I don't remember whether we arrived in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> and then she arrived later or she was already there. </sentence><sentence id="2371">Because we were together with the other Hungarian people. </sentence><sentence id="2372">And even though she came from <span

was there. </sentence><sentence id="2376">That she was deported just like we were, as a Hungarian citizen living abroad. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Living in a <span class="country">country</span> that was occupied or in some way connected with <span class="country">Germany</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2378">And we were all in the same <span class="building">barrack</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2379">And the <span class="building">barracks</span> were very clean, they were very well kept. </sentence><sentence id="2380">And we slept in <span class="spatial

are very popular in <span class="country">Europe</span>, or they might have been just some kind of things, <span class="spatial object">sacks</span> filled up with whatever filling they had.

supplies and there was a <span class="interior space">wash room</span> and a <span class="interior space">bathroom</span> with running water. </sentence><sentence id="2392">So the things weren't really, it was not as primitive as some other <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2393">And I know that at first we didn't do anything and it was rather boring. </sentence><sentence id="2394">And there were a lot of people from <span class="country">Holland</span>, I think I mentioned that, diamond cutters. </sentence><sentence id="2395">And they definitely would not work in anything. </sentence><sentence id="2396">They were kind of sheltered because their hands could not get ruined because they wouldn't be able to do the precision work evidently that's

just things from the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2400">I just don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2401">But I know that we didn't just sit idly the whole time. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And again we had three meals a day, I mean there were no scrambled eggs for breakfast, there was just maybe a piece of bread with some margarine and coffee, which was usually kind of brown water but at least it was sweetened with saccharine I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="2403">And then for lunch we had sandwiches and again coffee. </sentence><sentence id="2404">And in the evening there was some kind of soup with maybe some meat and lots of potatoes and vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="2405">And we weren't hungry. </sentence><sentence id="2406">As a matter of fact, I, you know, we could get seconds on soup. </sentence><sentence id="2407">It was very surprising to us that that was a <span class="populated place">concentration

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2500">A: No, you see, all that we got last Summer but when Yesh-e (ph) came back, when he was released from <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, he must have been told the same thing that we were told when you have not seen or you haven't heard anything. </sentence><sentence id="2501">He was forbidden, he was let go on the basis that he is not going to talk about what he saw or what happened to him in the <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2502">And even his closest family, according to his brother to whom we talked recently, he said nobody ever knew what happened to Yesh-e (ph) during the six or eight months that he was away. </sentence><sentence id="2503">And also he doesn't know why they let him go except that maybe they needed the <span class="interior space">space</span> for somebody else that they wanted to do in. </sentence><sentence id="2504">So we just knew that there was a place that people didn't want to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="2505">But we had absolutely no idea what actually was going on in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> or in any of the <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2506">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2507">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2508"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2509">Q: So when you were in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, did you have any fears or expectations of what might happen? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2510">A: No we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2511">Just because, we heard that the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span> were <span class="populated place">camps</span> where they put the people there and they were suppose to be working and we just had glimpses of it, but here we were in a so-called <span class="populated place">concentration camp</span> and it was nothing like anybody would have thought. </sentence><sentence id="2512">That it was bad, that there were starving people or, we weren't beaten, we weren't, on the contrary, everybody was quite polite and quite nice to us. </sentence><sentence id="2513">And I don't know, is it because the type of <span class="populated place">camp</span> they were running at that time was a, sort of a <span class="populated place">holding camp</span> for people that they wanted to use for some other purposes or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2514">And it was very, very strange when I, later on when I told somebody that I was in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> before, they just couldn't believe that it wasn't as bad as it was when we were there later. </sentence><sentence id="2515">And on the way to <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> as I told you before, we would stop in <span class="building">prisons</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2516">But a couple of times we did stop in some <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="2517">I don't remember the names, but I know that they were <span class="populated place">camps</span> because we were put in a <span class="building">barrack</span>, but again, they were <span class="spatial object">bunk beds</span>, they were, maybe these were <span class="interior space">spaces</span> that they were reserving for temporary guests, or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="2518">But not for the actual inmates because we really, on all these excursions we never saw what we saw later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="3350">Pus was oozing and these were big, round circles all over my shins. </sentence><sentence id="3351">And so they took me to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and they really didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3352">I think they put some Vaseline or something over the wounds and covered it with some gauze and there I was lying and hoping that it will heal. </sentence><sentence id="3353">But at the same time, the German doctors were coming in and drawing blood from us. </sentence><sentence id="3354">And then injecting us with something and I have no idea whether these were suppose to be medications or whatever, but anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3355">Then they were also doing vaginal and rectal examinations with their fingers. </sentence><sentence id="3356">Which wasn't exactly what I considered pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="3357">And it was rather very humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="3358">I just didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3359">I was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="3360">There were several women that were singled out and we were sort of in a group and it was extremely humiliating. </sentence><sentence id="3361">I was only 20 or so and I just didn't feel that this was exactly the treatment I wanted to have but I was probably worried more about my legs. </sentence><sentence id="3362">And then I think I mentioned it before, that the women, there was a couple of Jewish women doctors and they said that they knew that there was going to be another selection in the <span class="building">hospital</span> so they dismissed me together with some other women because they were afraid that the state I was in, I would have been selected to the <span class="interior space">gas chamber</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3363">So I was put back into my regular <span class="building">barracks</span> and I barely could walk. </sentence><sentence id="3364">But at that time, I was still working in that weaving business so I didn't have to walk into the <span class="dlf">fields</span> and I was able to stand during the roll call and then just go to the <span class="building">barracks</span>, which were right on the premises. </sentence><sentence id="3365">So it wasn't like I had to go very far. </sentence><sentence id="3366">And eventually my legs healed but they were, I had sort of scars all over, from my ankles to my knees, and I tried to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3367">It is not the primary source, and

careful with scratching and things that may aggravate the condition. </sentence><sentence id="3369">My legs eventually healed. </sentence><sentence id="3370">It took about another month or so, but anyway, I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="3371">So this was another thing that I wanted to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="3372">The other thing that I wanted to say was that about two months before, two or three months before we were arrested, it might have been around Christmas time or maybe a little bit later, I discovered that I was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3373">And I went to a Polish doctor, a gynecologist who determined that I was about two months pregnant, maybe two-and-a-half, and he did an abortion right in his <span class="building">office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3374">And I was very sad that I had to do it but in the circumstances I couldn't possibly have a baby. </sentence><sentence id="3375">And if I did have one, I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably wouldn't have survived anyway and the baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today. </sentence><sentence id="3376">But if you do think like that, if you just keep on thinking all you're life about the child that wasn't born. </sentence><sentence id="3377">So, this was another trauma that I had to live with. </sentence><sentence id="3378">Then I didn't give it much thought of course when I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>, as I said before, that <span class="env feature">nature</span> takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the <span class="building">prison</span> in <span class="populated place">Krakow</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3379">And I didn't menstruate until I came to <span class="populated place">New York</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3380">And I really think it was a blessing because I just cannot image thousands of women without any <span class="spatial object">sanitary facilities</span> having their periods. </sentence><sentence id="3381">Now the ones that were in the <span class="populated place">camp</span> a long time, they and the cappos (ph), some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so, and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already, but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="3382">But what amazed me was that really, it was almost like a miracle that we didn't menstruate because it would have been a big, big mess.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3446">Q: Can you talk a little bit about how these two events that you just mentioned have effected you're life since then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3448">A: Well, as I said, you never stop thinking of the child that you, well I can't say killed, but didn't permit to be born. </sentence><sentence id="3449">And I have four wonderful children and you always think how wonderful that one might have been. </sentence><sentence id="3450">So my life was very much effected by everything that happened to me because to this day I have nightmares and I wake up and I don't know where I am, and I have all kinds of physical problems. </sentence><sentence id="3451">What was it, a year and a half ago I finally was sort of diagnosed with an ailment that I've had for about twenty years or so. </sentence><sentence id="3452">That I would come down with, or maybe more than twenty years, I came down with, suddenly, with high fever. </sentence><sentence id="3453">But it was like 104, and shaking and practically being unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="3454">And it would come on quite suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="3455">It would last for several days and usually I got better. </sentence><sentence id="3456">And it would happen like about every three to four months. </sentence><sentence id="3457">And eventually I got sort of use to it and I paid no attention to it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3458">But a year and a half ago I had my neurosurgery, but two months later, again I got this fever. </sentence><sentence id="3459">And this time it was much more serious because I, well, Robert knows because he was taking care of me. </sentence><sentence id="3460">It was so bad that, you know, you don't call you're doctor after hours, and he got to call the doctor and find out what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3461">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3462">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3463"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 Whether he should take me to the <span class="building">hospital</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3464">And my doctor, who is a physician, said that I have something called the Brill Zincer Syndrome (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3465">And she researched it and found out that a lot of people who had typhus in the <span class="populated place">concentration camps</span>, the which causes the typhus just becomes dormant and every so often it wakes up and causes the fever. </sentence><sentence id="3466">But usually they are mild attacks and very few people paid much attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="3467">But this time I was really seriously ill. </sentence><sentence id="3468">It was 104, you are not joking you know. </sentence><sentence id="3469">My doctor put me in the <span class="building">hospital</span> and just to do the tests, and they ruled out every possible disease that could cause this kind of symptoms, like tuberculosis and and fever, and what is the one in working, the Valley Fever, and anyway, I don't know how many tests they did and they send my blood to a <span class="building">clinic</span> and they were testing it for , but the strain that they had wasn't exactly, the results were quite inconclusive. </sentence><sentence id="3470">But when I went to <span class="country">Poland</span> the following Summer, Yesh-e (ph) was still alive and he said that he was a and he said that the strain of was a specific strain that was in <span class="region">Eastern Europe</span> and it was called Ball-in-netsa (ph) or whatever, and he said that they should have tested for that and that definitely would have been positive. </sentence><sentence id="3471">But my doctor wasn't going to wait for any tests and he put me on very high doses of tetracycline. </sentence><sentence id="3472">And I was on tetracycline for about six weeks and the fever subsided and the tests were negative again. </sentence><sentence id="3473">And he says, well, let's wait for the six months and see whether you get anything again. </sentence><sentence id="3474">And I was sort of use to it, you know, it was just matter-of-fact. </sentence><sentence id="3475">I was getting use to it and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3476">But it is already two years and I haven't had the fever anymore so they decided they killed off the . </sentence><sentence id="3477">And evidently you have to do it when the are active, when you have the fever. </sentence><sentence id="3478">And another symptom which was described in the book, because that was the first thing that the doctor asked, where is the rash?And I had a rash going from the armpit down the arm and that was the first thing that he asked, whether I had the rash because that was one of the very typical symptoms of this sort of syndrome. </sentence><sentence id="3479">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 So that's another thing that I had. </sentence><sentence id="3482">And another symptom that, now since we are talking about diseases, is that after I had, well maybe when we come to <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> the second time we can talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="3483">Or should we talk about the diseases now? </sentence><sentence id="3484">Because another thing was I had typhus in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3485">Everybody had typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3486">I didn't have tuberculosis, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3487">But there are spots on my lungs that are calcified, but it's sort of secondary symptoms. </sentence><sentence id="3488">It's really is not too significant. </sentence><sentence id="3489">I mean, I have something that's called a B Lung picture, but its, the thing that was was the typhus. </sentence><sentence id="3490">And another thing that people where getting was starvation edema. </sentence><sentence id="3491">And this was something that was really frightening because you woke up in the morning and you're eyes were swollen with bags under the eyes and they were getting more and more swollen during the day. </sentence><sentence id="3492">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3493">In three days you were dead. </sentence><sentence id="3494">I mean, it was just unbelievable because you could see the people swelling. </sentence><sentence id="3495">The faces would get swollen and the legs, the feet and the hands, and then eventually the whole body. </sentence><sentence id="3496">And as I understand this was diagnosed as starvation edema. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And I didn't get it to that extent. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And my legs were very swollen, my feet were swollen and my face just a little bit but somehow I recovered from it. </sentence><sentence id="3499">I didn't die. </sentence><sentence id="3500">But it was very, very frightening and I have absolutely no tolerance for salt. </sentence><sentence id="3501">I am on an almost salt-free diet most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="3502">If I go to a <span class="building">restaurant</span>, like for example today, and I had the tuna fish sandwich, I will have to take medicine when I come <span class="building">home</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3503">And I am on medication the whole time, the dietetics. </sentence><sentence id="3504">And my doctor who is fairly new in <span class="populated place">town</span> because my old doctor retired and I got a new one, and he was very much against the dietetics and he just didn't think that I should take them. </sentence><sentence id="3505">And he asked me to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And two days later, Robert took me to the <span class="building">doctor's office</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3507">I couldn't go to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3508">I gained about twelve pounds on the <span class="spatial

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3590">Q: Did you ever learn what kinds of experiments were being conducted at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3592">A: No, I never learned. </sentence><sentence id="3593">All I knew is that they took quite a bit of blood from us and they were injecting us with something else and they were taking, but they were doing so many things of that sort that you just didn't pay any attention to it. </sentence><sentence id="3594">And I don't think that that cause any, that was in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, and the edema came in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, so I don't think that those two have anything to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3595">And I don't know why I didn't get typhus in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, maybe because they were de-lousing us. </sentence><sentence id="3596">But the typhus was in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3597">And of course the psychological effects of the whole experience is something else. </sentence><sentence id="3598">Because I go to the <span class="building">hairdresser</span>, I put make-up on, and I was going, you know, I got three graduate degrees and I did very well. </sentence><sentence id="3599">I was on the Dean's list and I was, I got one of my Master's Degree's in art with distinction, and I entertain and I go out and I think I look very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="3600">But a lot of it is also a <span class="dlf">facade</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3601">Because Robert knows that there are times that, I call it I'm out of my head. </sentence><sentence id="3602">And I have to have a nanny for the kids because I couldn't always take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="3603">So I was very fortunate that I could afford, or my husband could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="3604">So we had a nanny for seventeen years, until Sir-re-high (ph) started <span class="building">High School</span>, so she was sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="3605">Well actually I had a nanny for longer than that because Margaret was with us for seventeen years and before that we had a nanny for five years. </sentence><sentence id="3606">So, I mean different nannies, but then we found one that stayed with us for seventeen years because I could not take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="3607">And very few people know that because I, my kids were brought up and I participated in <span class="building">PTA</span> and I just pretended that I lead a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="3608">And so I think I finish on the fact that I had a good <span class="dlf">facade</span> and everything, but every so often the children would say, well mother you never really took care of us, it was Margaret who did. </sentence><sentence id="3609">But I tried to be a very good mother and I think I did do a good job. </sentence><sentence id="3610">I made sure This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 that they go to <span class="building">school</span> and do well in <span class="building">school</span> and what-not, but there were many times that, I call it I couldn't take care of them the way, you know, I should have. </sentence><sentence id="3613">And there was something, always, I think I held them when they were babies, but we had very little physical contact when they were growing up. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And even now, you know, it may be just a peck on the cheek or something like that, but you never see me kissing the kids and really hugging them. </sentence><sentence id="3615">I do with my grandchildren though. </sentence><sentence id="3616">My grandchildren I hug and I hold and I play with them, but somehow with my children, there was some kind of a <span class="dlf">barrier</span> that I couldn't break. </sentence><sentence id="3617">And I know it was all in my head and I was examined by a German psychiatrist for the restitution and he decided I was nuts. </sentence><sentence id="3618">Oh yes, they rewarded me restitution all right. </sentence><sentence id="3619">I get a monthly check because I figured out that they pay wasn't very high because, you know, at first they gave me a lump sum and it came out to about $5.00 per diem for the time that I was in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3620">But it was more than nothing, but then they awarded me a monthly pension and they adjusted it since I have been working, and then they said, well, if you are working you really can't or don't deserve the full amount. </sentence><sentence id="3621">But then I petitioned and I send more letters and I have a stack of correspondence with the German government, through my lawyer who is a German man and very, very helpful and he specializes in the restitutions, so that's another story that maybe worth preserving. </sentence><sentence id="3622">All the letters that we were sending back and forth to find out whether I am deserving or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3656">Q: What did you're psychological state have to do with the restitution? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3658">A: Oh, well what my psychological state was that I wasn't, okay, my husband was supporting me supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="3659">They wanted to know how much money he was making and so on and I insisted that in <span class="country">America</span>, women are independent and I am not able to work. </sentence><sentence id="3660">You see, I didn't start working for money really. </sentence><sentence id="3661">For making a living, until my second husband died. </sentence><sentence id="3662">Before that when I was working, it was charity work and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="3663">And I was teaching at the <span class="building">university</span> as a student teacher. </sentence><sentence id="3664">I wasn't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3665">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3666"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 really working for money. </sentence><sentence id="3667">And so the reason that they awarded me the restitution was, it is really a pension. </sentence><sentence id="3668">Nobody can live on that pension because it was like $300.00 and then every year they adjust it for cost of living, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3669">So it wouldn't even pay half the rent for a small <span class="interior space">room</span> somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3670">But I had to have a physical examination by a German doctor and who determined that I had a chronic edema, or whatever he called it, and then, I don't know, whatever else his diagnosis was, and then they decided to have me checked by a psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="3671">And he gave me the standard psychiatric examination and I had to fill out all kinds of questionnaires, you know, whether I feel that I am being followed and whether I can sleep or whether I can't sleep, do I have nightmares, and I actually had everything that he was asking for, so I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="3672">And then he decided that maybe I do deserve some kind of a pension because he didn't think that anybody would employ me in the state of mind I was. </sentence><sentence id="3673">So that's another story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3734">A: When I got married in June, 1947 to Dr. Levin, we decided that we didn't want to have children the first few years because we both were going to go to <span class="building">school</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3735">And I wanted to get my degree from the <span class="building">University of Michigan</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3736">That's where he was going to be for three years in surgical residency. </sentence><sentence id="3737">So when we were even still in, we got married in <span class="populated place">Dallas</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3738">And I went to a gynecologist for my pre-marital examination and he examined me and he told me that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant because he thinks I am completely sterile. </sentence><sentence id="3739">My fallopian tubes were plugged, scarred, and there was no way I could possibly get pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3740">And so, of course it was a great shock to me. </sentence><sentence id="3741">I told him my history and he said, well, this is what contributed to it. </sentence><sentence id="3742">And I, of course, I didn't want to get married, because my future husband was from a large family. </sentence><sentence id="3743">There were six children and he was the only son. </sentence><sentence id="3744">Well, actually he had a half-brother, but he was the only son of his mother, and he, they definitely wanted to have a grandson or granddaughter, or whatever, so it was a great disappointment to him and he didn't tell his parents. </sentence><sentence id="3745">But he said he didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3746">He still wanted to get married, even though I didn't, but we did get married. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And I just tried not to think about it. </sentence><sentence id="3748">But I tried to plan my life. </sentence><sentence id="3749">Definitely go to <span class="building">school</span> and have some kind of a profession so that I can be working and not missing the fact that I can't be a mother. </sentence><sentence id="3750">So, actually I was so busy with the <span class="building">university</span> studies that I did not really have time to worry about anything else at that point. </sentence><sentence id="3751">But then, he was finishing his residency and I was finishing my graduate degree and we were going to move on. </sentence><sentence id="3752">And looking for a place to settle. </sentence><sentence id="3753">And I thought that maybe I should do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="3754">But we moved to <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> and I got a job as a Medical Technologist at <span class="building">Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital</span> and he was a surgeon there. </sentence><sentence id="3755">And we had a very good friend who was a gynecologist and we told him my predicament and he said that he will see what he can do. </sentence><sentence id="3756">He gave me a very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3757">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3758"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 thorough examination and then I had, he put me on high doses of penicillin, back then penicillin was very much in use. </sentence><sentence id="3759">And so if there was any kind of infection, then it would definitely get cleared. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And then in addition he put me through quite painful treatments. </sentence><sentence id="3761">It is kind of a little complicated, these are uterine injections of lapydol (ph), which is a very heavy oil with, first he tried to blow the <span class="env feature">air</span> through and he wasn't able to, my tubes were definitely plugged. </sentence><sentence id="3762">And then lapydol (ph) is a very heavy oil and it has some kind of an additive to it that it will show up on x-rays, and so he injected that and the lapydol (ph) is suppose to go through the <span class="spatial object">tubes</span> and if they, and the weight of it sometimes will open them. </sentence><sentence id="3763">And the <span class="spatial object">tubes</span> are really opened into the <span class="interior space">abdominal cavity</span> and the good sign is when the lapydol (ph) spills into the <span class="interior space">abdominal cavity</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3764">And it's quite painful because there is some kind of a nerve connection, especially if, the pain is hitting the shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="3765">And nothing happened with the injection. </sentence><sentence id="3766">And he repeated it and after two days there was a spill on the right side. </sentence><sentence id="3767">So he said, well, that was sufficient indication that things may be all right. </sentence><sentence id="3768">And a few months later I did get pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3769">And so we spent a year in <span class="populated place">Detroit</span> and then I was about three months pregnant when we left. </sentence><sentence id="3770">And we came to <span class="populated place">Fresno</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3771">And my daughter was born in August, we came to <span class="populated place">Fresno</span> in December and my daughter was born in August. </sentence><sentence id="3772">So things turned out for the best. </sentence><sentence id="3773">But without medical treatments and all, I probably would have not been able to have children. </sentence><sentence id="3774">The American doctor who examined me the first time, when I went there for my pre-marital examination, because I was getting married and I didn't think that I wanted to get pregnant right away, said that I probably would never get pregnant because my <span class="spatial object">tubes</span> were scarred and plugged up. </sentence><sentence id="3775">And that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="3776">And he wanted to know what could have caused it. </sentence><sentence id="3777">And I wanted to know what the cause might have been and he says, well, one of the causes that usually plugs up the <span class="spatial object">tubes</span> is an infection and its mainly gonorrhea and I said, well, how on earth would I have gotten gonorrhea and he says, well, you just think. </sentence><sentence id="3778">And you know you can This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3779">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3780"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 get gonorrhea by an intercourse with an infected person, which I did not have, and so I told him about the gynecological examinations that I was getting in the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3781">And that when I was in the <span class="building">hospital</span> with the skin infection, there were also doctors coming in and poking their fingers into us, and I did not think that they were having sterile gloves on because they were going from one woman to another without changing the gloves. </sentence><sentence id="3782">They were protecting themselves but not us. </sentence><sentence id="3783">And these were vaginal and rectal examinations and the doctor, the American doctor who examined me in <span class="populated place">Dallas</span>, he said yes, that was sufficient to get you infected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3835">Q: How long all told were you in the <span class="building">hospital</span> at <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3837">A: I really don't quite remember. </sentence><sentence id="3838">It could have been, probably around ten days. </sentence><sentence id="3839">And one thing that I remember very distinctly was that sometimes they were dressing the wounds on a <span class="spatial object">table</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3840">We were in <span class="spatial object">bunks</span> all the way around and there was a <span class="interior space">space</span> in the center and they would put the patient there and several doctors would be standing around her and doing all kinds of things so that we couldn't really see, but one time I saw her legs. </sentence><sentence id="3841">I thought mine were in a bad shape, but her's were so bad that you could see the bone. </sentence><sentence id="3842">The flesh was just practically rotted away. </sentence><sentence id="3843">And one of the things that they would, they didn't do the maggot treatment to me, but it was very popular in <span class="country">Europe</span> to use maggots to treat this kind of wounds. </sentence><sentence id="3844">And I know that her legs were just crawling with maggots. </sentence><sentence id="3845">And evidently maggots were putting some kind of an enzyme or whatever, that was killing the dead tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3846">Or maybe they were eating the dead tissue and that stimulated the granulation and growth of the new tissue. </sentence><sentence id="3847">And that was one of the cures. </sentence><sentence id="3848">So they did use maggots, but they didn't use penicillin. </sentence><sentence id="3849">They didn't use maggots on me, I somehow got better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3863">Q: Were they treating you in any way that was productive? </sentence><sentence id="3864">That was helpful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3867">A: Well, as I say, it seems to me that they put some kind of an ointment on my wounds and they were somewhat helpful, so that the oozing stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3868">It looked like Vaseline, but I can't believe that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3869">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3870"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 Vaseline alone could have cured, but anyway, at least the things were not full of mud and dirt, which I would have gotten in the regular <span class="building">barracks</span>, or even going to <span class="building">work</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3871">So there were bandages, they bandaged my legs and they were at least kept clean. </sentence><sentence id="3872">I was a pretty healthy and strong person at that time and I guess it was my resistance and just my natural ability to heal. </sentence><sentence id="3873">And to this day I heal very well. </sentence><sentence id="3874">I get a cut on my finger and two days later it is gone, so maybe it was just my ability to heal well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: And you mentioned that you left the <span class="building">hospital</span> before you were completely healed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3886">I left the <span class="building">hospital</span> because of the on coming selection. </sentence><sentence id="3887">And the doctors that were there, the women doctors, they were Jewish women doctors. </sentence><sentence id="3888">They were afraid that the selection may not be very selective and they may just reduce the number of patients so they didn't want anybody who was well enough to walk out, was asked to walk out. </sentence><sentence id="3889">And as I say, after that, I went back to my <span class="building">barrack</span> and I was able to stand the roll call and I was able to walk to that place where we were plaiting the braids. </sentence><sentence id="3890">And sitting all day, I could still keep my bandages on my legs and then I think a couple of times, as I recall, I went to the <span class="building">hospital</span> and I had the bandages changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3897">Q: Did you ever see Yannosh (ph), you're husband, during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3899">A: <span class="populated place">Yannosh</span> (ph) disappeared about half way. </sentence><sentence id="3900">I think I saw him a few times and I said he came on some errands, he brought some stuff with the other workers to the <span class="populated place">camp</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3901">And I don't know exactly what, and I was able to say a few words to him. </sentence><sentence id="3902">But it was not more than two or three times. </sentence><sentence id="3903">The first time when he came was to, he told us that father died, and that was just maybe like a few days, maybe a week or so, maybe two weeks after we were separated into the different <span class="populated place">camps</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3904">He died very soon after he got there. </sentence><sentence id="3905">But I didn't see Yannosh (ph) maybe for three months and after that I didn't see him anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3906">| don't think I saw him after October. </sentence><sentence id="3907">As I remember, the last time I saw him was the weather was still bearable and then in October it started to get very cold and snow, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3908">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3909"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 I know I didn't see him anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3910">And I told you before that when I was in <span class="populated place">Paris</span>, that there were two guys that said that they knew him in <span class="populated place">camp</span> and that he was selected and that they never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="3911">And evidently because he was crippled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3925">Q: Do you remember that last time you saw him? </sentence><sentence id="3926">What you said to him, what you said to each other? </sentence><sentence id="3927">Anything about that last time you saw him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3931">A: I didn't know it would be the last time. </sentence><sentence id="3932">I didn't think that each time was the last time, but there was very little that we could say to each other. </sentence><sentence id="3933">It was, I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3937">Q: And you mentioned there was another place that you were working, beside in that, another place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3939">A: Yes, I was also working on some kind of a <span class="dlf">brick-laying place</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3940">And I remember one thing, that one of the guards complimented me. </sentence><sentence id="3941">That I had a very good ability to measure the distances because my bricks were laid very evenly and I was spreading the mortar, I think I was buttering a slice of bread, and that the bricks were built very, very evenly and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3942">And what we were working, and that was a very short time that we were working on it, were large, round, <span class="building">brick structures</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3943">It doesn't seem to me that they were ever finished, but by then we, of course, we knew exactly about the <span class="building">crematoria</span> and we knew about everything else. </sentence><sentence id="3944">And what these <span class="building">structures</span> were suppose to be was, and I don't know whether that was the hearsay or whatever, but that's what we were kind of hearing, that these were going to be special <span class="building">extermination places</span> with sort of electrical contraptions that would be <span class="building">electrical crematoria</span> and electrical killing, the high voltage. </sentence><sentence id="3945">But I don't know whether that was true and I never really found out what these <span class="building">structures</span> were. </sentence><sentence id="3946">And when we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, I was telling Robert about these <span class="building">structures</span> and the first time we went to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> he says, that's what you described. </sentence><sentence id="3947">And I said, yes, that's what I was working on. </sentence><sentence id="3948">And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3949">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3950"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 we never found out in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> what these things were supposed to be. </sentence><sentence id="3951">But it was very, we probably will go again and I'll try to find out what they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3965">Q: They were in <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>, these <span class="building">structures</span>? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3967">A: In <span class="populated place">Birkenau</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3968">Right past the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>, or along side the <span class="building">crematoriums</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3969">And I don't think they were ever finished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3973">Q: You mentioned earlier that by the time you got to <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> you were hearing more news of the war and of the <span class="region">outside world</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3974">Do you recall some of the news that you heard? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3977">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="3978">I just know that, well actually it was more in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span> than in <span class="populated place">Belsen-Bergen</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3979">In <span class="populated place">Belsen-Bergen</span>, whatever news we got was when the new <span class="spatial object">transport</span> came. </sentence><sentence id="3980">But all the <span class="spatial object">transports</span> that were coming to <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> were mainly from <span class="country">Holland</span> or from other <span class="country">countries</span>, from smaller countries. </sentence><sentence id="3981">And they were very small <span class="spatial object">transports</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3982">And it seems like, as I mentioned before, that they all seemed to be of prisoners or some political people that were rather taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="3983">As I say, we weren't, we didn't seem to be doomed or anything. </sentence><sentence id="3984">Just like the <span class="spatial object">Holland diamond cutters</span>, they were being sort of guarded and preserved. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And so, if a new <span class="spatial object">transport</span> came, they might have told us what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3986">But we really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3987">But while we were in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>, there were <span class="spatial object">underground radios</span> and then also there were a lot of workers who were going outside and coming back in the evening and they would bring some news that what was happening on the front and what was happening with the war. </sentence><sentence id="3988">And at one point we knew that the Russians were coming and that the siege of <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="3989">That there was an uprising in <span class="populated place">Warsaw</span>. </sentence><sentence id="3990">And I just don't remember really. </sentence><sentence id="3991">We were much more concerned about surviving from day to day than worrying what was happening outside. </sentence><sentence id="3992">There were raids, air raids. </sentence><sentence id="3993">There were quite a few air raids and we were hoping that they will bomb but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3994">The <span class="spatial object">airplanes</span> were swooping down but they were never really throwing any bombs on the <span class="building">crematoria</span> and we were disappointed because we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 thought that maybe they would destroy the <span class="building">crematorium</span>, they couldn't be used. </sentence><sentence id="3997">But they were saying that it was the <span class="spatial object">American planes</span> that were coming. </sentence><sentence id="3998">And we could hear the anti-craft shooting, but I don't think they ever shot down any <span class="spatial object">planes</span> either, but they were just shooting at them. </sentence><sentence id="3999">And so, but we really had very, very little contact with the outside world. </sentence><sentence id="4000">And when we were in <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span>, we didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="4001">But we haven't gotten to <span class="populated place">Bergen-Belsen</span> yet. </sentence><sentence id="4002">We are still in <span class="populated place">Auschwitz</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4003">A couple escaped, there were people escaping. </sentence><sentence id="4004">And we witnessed one hanging of a couple that escaped. </sentence><sentence id="4005">And we understand that there were more escapes and more hangings, but we did witness one. </sentence><sentence id="4006">And there were also suicides. </sentence><sentence id="4007">I mean, it was very easy to commit suicide if you could just get to the <span class="dlf">high voltage wires</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4008">And some people did. </sentence><sentence id="4009">Another thing that happened that was quite a regular occurrence were the <span class="interior space">latrines</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4010">I mean, we had to go when we were ordered to go and I don't know whether you saw the pictures, I didn't see any pictures in here of the <span class="interior space">latrines</span>, but it was a cement kind of a <span class="dlf">block</span> in the center of the <span class="building">barrack</span> with <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4011">A double row of <span class="dlf">holes</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4012">And you were supposed to do your business there. </sentence><sentence id="4013">And that sure was not a very pleasant sight or a very pleasant time. </sentence><sentence id="4014">And this one thing that I was really suffering from was constipation and to this day I still have to be very careful what I eat and what I do and the timing because, I don't want to talk about it, Robert. </sentence><sentence id="4015">But maybe this is important that it is recorded too. </sentence><sentence id="4016">I mean, you don't like to talk about these things, but I remember one night. </sentence><sentence id="4017">I mean, at night if we had to go, there was a <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4018">And I remember one night I had to go and the cappo (ph) would not let, and I think it was Betsy with me, they wouldn't let us until we emptied the <span class="spatial object">bucket</span>. </sentence><sentence id="4019">And the bucket was about, like a 30 gallon <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span>, maybe 25 gallon <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span>, I know it wasn't as high as that, it was about this high. </sentence><sentence id="4020">And she said we have to carry the <span class="spatial object">garbage can</span> to the <span class="interior space">latrine</span>, there was a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> that you poured it in, before we can use it. </sentence><sentence id="4021">And that's not a very pleasant feeling either. </sentence><sentence id="4022">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

was not proper to do it, but at that point we didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="4956">We just wanted things and we wanted to, I don't know why, well, it wasn't called stealing, it was called

things. </sentence><sentence id="4958">So we went around and I heard, see I lived in the <span class="country">country</span> before I was arrested, and I heard sort of a familiar sound, birds or something, so I was with two other women. </sentence><sentence id="4959">And we followed the sound and there was a <span class="building">coop</span> with a goose inside. </sentence><sentence

today I think it was awful and I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, but we pulled the goose out and we threw the head back in. </sentence><sentence id="4971">And we were walking back dragging the goose and then we were thinking what will happen if the people come back and they will just find the head. </sentence><sentence id="4972">Maybe they wanted to have the goose and the other girls were saying, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="4973">Nobody was worried about you. </sentence><sentence id="4974">We have the goose and we sat in a <span class="dlf">ditch</span> and we plucked the
